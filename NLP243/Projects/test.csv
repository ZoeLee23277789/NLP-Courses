"Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman  introduced a design challenge  called the marshmallow challenge.",几年前，在TED大会上， Peter Skillman 介绍了一个设计挑战 叫做“棉花糖挑战”
"And the idea's pretty simple:  Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure  out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,  one yard of tape, one yard of string  and a marshmallow.",是个非常简单的主意 要求一组四人的团队搭建一个独立的最高建筑 材料是20根意大利面条 一段胶带，一段绳子 一块棉花糖
The marshmallow has to be on top.,棉花糖必须放在最上面
"And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard  because it forces people  to collaborate very quickly.",这虽然看似简单，其实并不容易 因为它要求人们 迅速地合作
"And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,  and I incorporated it into a design workshop.",我觉得这是个有趣的主意 我把它放到了设计专题讨论会上
And it was a huge success.,结果非常成功
"And since then, I've conducted  about 70 design workshops across the world  with students and designers and architects,  even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,  and there's something about this exercise  that reveals very deep lessons  about the nature of collaboration,  and I'd like to share some of them with you.",从那以后， 我在全球 70多个设计专题讨论活动中 让学生们和设计者，建筑师 甚至财富50强的首席技术官 这个练习在很多方面给了我们 深刻的启迪 教会我们合作的特性 在这里我跟你们分享一些
"So, normally, most people begin  by orienting themselves to the task.",通常， 人们总是从 讨论开始着手完成这个任务
"They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,  they jockey for power.",他们讨论一阵， 勾勒出结果会是什么样子 他们互相争论一番对错
"Then they spend some time planning, organizing,  they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.",然后花费点时间计划，组织 他们画一下图纸然后拿出意大利面条
They spend the majority of their time  assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.,他们用了大量的时间 把意大利面条组装得越来越高
"And then finally, just as they're running out of time,  someone takes out the marshmallow,  and then they gingerly put it on top,  and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --  they admire their work.",然后最后，时间快要用完了 他们拿出棉花糖 小心翼翼地将棉花糖放到最上面 然后他们后退一步，哈哈 他们欣赏着他们的成果
"But what really happens, most of the time,  is that the ""ta-da"" turns into an ""uh-oh,""  because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure  to buckle and to collapse.",但是绝大多数时候，真正发生的是 “哈哈” 变成了“糟了” 因为棉花糖的重量把整个结构 给压散架了
"So there are a number of people  who have a lot more ""uh-oh"" moments than others,  and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.",有那么一些人 他们的“糟了”时刻比其他人多 其中最糟的是新毕业的商学院学生
"They lie, they cheat, they get distracted  and they produce really lame structures.",他们说谎，他们欺骗，很容易受干扰 他们的建筑构造非常蹩脚
"And of course there are teams  that have a lot more ""ta-da"" structures,  and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.",当然也有一些团队 他们创造了更多的“哈哈”时刻 其中最好的，就是新毕业的幼儿园小朋友
And it's pretty amazing.,这个真是很神奇
"As Peter tells us,  not only do they produce the tallest structures,  but they're the most interesting structures of them all.",正如PETER告诉我们的 他们不但造出了最高的建筑 而且他们搭建的结构也是最有趣的
So the question you want to ask is:  How come? Why? What is it about them?,所以你会问 这是怎么回事？他们到底有什么特点？
"And Peter likes to say that  none of the kids spend any time  trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?",Peter喜欢这样说： “因为没有任何孩子企图做 意大利面条公司的总裁。” 是的
They don't spend time jockeying for power.,他们没在争夺权力上花任何时间
But there's another reason as well.,但是其中还有另一个原因
"And the reason is that business students are trained  to find the single right plan, right?",因为商学院的学生受过的专业训练是 去寻找一个正确的计划
And then they execute on it.,然后他们按照计划执行
"And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,  they run out of time and what happens?",然而事实是， 当他们把棉花糖放到顶部时 他们用完了有限的时间，然后呢
It's a crisis.,危机就降临了
Sound familiar? Right.,听着很熟悉吧？是的。
"What kindergarteners do differently  is that they start with the marshmallow,  and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,  always keeping the marshmallow on top,  so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.",幼儿园的孩子的做法不一样 他们从棉花糖开始 他们先建一个样板模型， 然后不断在模型上加建， 其间总是让棉花糖保持在最上面 所以他们一直有很多机会去不断修正样板模型
Designers recognize this type of collaboration  as the essence of the iterative process.,于是设计者认识到这种合作是 这个互动过程中的重要因素
"And with each version, kids get instant feedback  about what works and what doesn't work.",对每个版本，孩子都会迅速地得到反馈 他们知道什么行，什么不行
"So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,  but let's look at how different teams perform.",所以把握雏形的能力是真正的关键 让我们来看看不同的队伍是怎样表现的
"So the average for most people is around 20 inches;  business schools students, about half of that;  lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,  kindergarteners, better than most adults.",大多数人建的塔的平均高度是20英尺 商学院学生， 大概是一半 律师好一些， 但也好不到哪里去 幼儿园的孩子，比大多数的成年人要好
Who does the very best?,谁做得最好呢？
"Architects and engineers, thankfully.",建筑师和工程师，谢天谢地。
Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.,我见过的最高的塔是39英寸
And why is it? Because they understand triangles  and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns  are the key to building  stable structures.,为什么呢？因为他们懂得三角形 和自我巩固的几何模式 是建筑 稳定结构的关键
"So CEOs, a little bit better than average,  but here's where it gets interesting.",总裁们比平均水平稍好一些 但是有趣的是
"If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,  they get significantly better.",如果你在他们的小组里加一个行政助理 他们的成绩马上变得好很多
"It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, ""Oh, that team's going to win.""",这真是令人难以置信， 你四处看看， 你说：“那个小组会赢。”
You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?,你很早就知道， 为什么呢？
Because they have special skills  of facilitation.,因为他们有特殊的 简化技巧
"They manage the process, they understand the process.",他们管理流程， 他们懂得流程
And any team who manages  and pays close attention to work  will significantly improve the team's performance.,总之，任何一个小组积极管理并 专注于工作本身的话 小组的表现就有显著的提高
Specialized skills and facilitation skills  are the combination that leads to strong success.,特殊技能以及善于使用简便的手法 两者的结合带来了成功
"If you have 10 teams that typically perform,  you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.",如果你有10个队参加这个活动 其中大概有6个队可以搭建可以直立的结构
And I tried something interesting.,我做了一个有趣的尝试
"I thought, let's up the ante, once.",我想， 我们不妨来赌一次
"So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.",所以我就提供了价值10万美元的软件给得胜的小组
So what do you think happened to these design students?,你猜猜那些学设计的学生们会有什么样的反应？
What was the result?,结果如何？
Here's what happened:  Not one team had a standing structure.,这就是结果 没有一个小组完成了一个站立的建筑
"If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,  they would have taken home the prize.",哪怕任何一个小组完成一个一英寸的建筑 他们就可以把奖杯捧回去
"So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes  have a strong impact.",所以，很有意思的是 高额奖金会有很大的影响。
We did the exercise again with the same students.,之后我们在同样的学生中又重复了这个活动
What do you think happened then?,你猜猜结果怎样？
So now they understand the value of prototyping.,这回他们知道了做样版模型的价值
So the same team went from being the very worst  to being among the very best.,所以最差的那个小组 成为了最好的小组
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.,他们用最少的时间完成了最高的建筑
So there's deep lessons for us  about the nature of incentives and success.,这些对我们都有很深的教育意义 揭示了奖励和成功的本质
"So, you might ask: Why would anyone  actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?",所以，你也许会问：怎么会有人 花时间写这么一个棉花糖的挑战
"And the reason is, I help create  digital tools and processes  to help teams build cars and video games  and visual effects.",原因是我可以用 电子工具和流程 来帮助人们造汽车，电子游戏 和模拟视觉效果
And what the marshmallow challenge does  is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.,而棉花糖的挑战教会我们 识别隐藏着的一些假设
"Because, frankly,  every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?",因为， 坦白说 每个项目都有它们自己的棉花糖
"The challenge provides a shared experience,  a common language,  a common stance to build the right prototype.",这个挑战提供了可以分享的经验 一种共同的语言 处理问题的通用方法
of this so simple exercise.,就是这个简单的练习
And those of you who are interested  may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.,可以给我们提供的有价值的经验 你们如果有兴趣 可以去marshmallowchallenge.com网站
It's a blog that you can look at  how to build the marshmallows.,这是一个你可以阅读的博客 告诉你怎样搭建棉花糖建筑
There's step-by-step instructions on this.,那里有具体的步骤说明
There are crazy examples from around the world  of how people tweak and adjust the system.,还有来自世界各地的稀奇古怪的例子 人们怎样调整系统
There's world records that are on this as well.,那里有世界记录
"And the fundamental lesson, I believe,  is that design truly is  a contact sport.",而我相信， 最根本的教意是： 设计其实是 一种交流运动
"It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,  and that we apply the very best of our thinking,  our feeling and our doing  to the challenge that we have at hand.",它要求我们把我们所有的神志都放到任务中 要求我们运用最佳的思维状态 我们的感知我们的行动 来迎接我们面对的挑战
"And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience  is all that it takes to turn us  from an ""uh-oh"" moment to a ""ta-da"" moment.",而有的时候， 一个小小的样板模型的经验 会帮助我们 将“糟了” 的那一刻变成了“”哈哈”的一刻
And that can make a big difference.,那造成的结果是大不同的
Thank you very much.,谢谢你们
Let's pretend right here we have a machine.,让我们设想这里有一台机器，
"A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,  and it's a time machine.",它是一个很大的，很酷的，很TED的机器， 它是一个时间机器。
And everyone in this room has to get into it.,这里每个人都要走进这个时间机器。
"And you can go backwards, you can go forwards;  you cannot stay where you are.",你可以选择返回过去或走到未来， 就是不能停在当下。
"And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends  this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.",我在想你们会怎么选，近来我问了我的朋友很多次这个问题， 他们的回答都是“回到过去”。
"I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles  or Twitter or ""American Idol.""",我不理解。他们说，要回到没有汽车、 没有twitter或《美国偶像》的年代。
I don't know.,我真的不理解。
"I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull  to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.",我敢肯定，这里必然是有一些怀旧的情愫 或者是痴心妄想。
And I understand that.,这我也能理解。
"I'm not part of that crowd, I have to say.",但是我必须承认，我跟他们不是一伙的。
"I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.",我不想回到过去，不是因为我喜欢冒险，
"It's because possibilities on this planet,  they don't go back, they go forward.",而是因为这个地球上的可能性， 不是走到过去可以获得的，你要走到未来。
"So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.",也就是说，我想走进这个机器，走到未来。
"This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet  by any measure that you wish to choose:  health, wealth,  mobility, opportunity,  declining rates of disease ...",我们这个时代是最美好的时代， 不管你用何种方式来衡量，如： 健康、财富、 流动性、机遇、 患病率不断下降。
There's never been a time like this.,从来没有过这么好的时代。
"My great-grandparents died, all of them,  by the time they were 60.",我的曾祖父母 在60岁的时候就死去了。
My grandparents pushed that number to 70.,我的祖父母70多岁就死了。
My parents are closing in on 80.,我的父母过世时是80几岁。
So there better be  a nine at the beginning of my death number.,我希望我死去的时候 是在一个9数字开头的时候。
"But it's not even about people like us,  because this is a bigger deal than that.",但这不仅仅是关乎我们这些人的事情， 因为事实比我们自身大得多。
A kid born in New Delhi today  can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.,今天在新德里出生的一个小孩 可以像100年前世界上最富的人
"Think about that, it's an incredible fact.",一样长寿命。 大家认真想想。这是个很了不起的事实啊。
And why is it true?,为什么会出现这样的事实呢？
Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions  of people on this planet.,是因为我们消灭了天花。 天花曾夺去了地球上数以亿计的人的生命。
It reshaped the demography of the globe  in a way that no war ever has.,它重塑了地球的人口布局， 这是任何战争也无法相比的。
It's gone. It's vanished.,但今天它已被彻底消灭了。
We vanquished it. Puff.,是人类铲除了它。
"In the rich world,  diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago  no longer exist, hardly.",在当今的富有社会里 仅仅一代人之前还给数百万人的生命带来威胁的疾病已经 几乎不再出现了。
"Diphtheria, rubella, polio ...","白喉, 德国麻疹，小儿麻痹症都几乎不存在了。"
does anyone even know what those things are?,你们知道这些名字是什么意思吗？
"Vaccines, modern medicine,  our ability to feed billions of people,  those are triumphs of the scientific method.",疫苗和现代医学 以及人类为数百万人提供食品的能力， 这些都是科学方法的胜利。
"And to my mind, the scientific method --  trying stuff out,  seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't --  is one of the great accomplishments of humanity.",在我看来，科学方法 就是不断的尝试， 检验，改变的过程。 它本身也是人类最伟大的功绩之一。
So that's the good news.,所以这些都是好消息。
"Unfortunately, that's all the good news  because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.",但不幸的是，好消息就这么多， 因为我们还遇到了其他一些难题，也被提到过很多次。
"And one of them is that  despite all our accomplishments,  a billion people go to bed hungry  in this world every day.",其中一个就是， 虽然我们取得了巨大的进步， 但是现在世界上还有10亿人吃不饱肚子， 每天，他们都在忍受饥饿的折磨。
"That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.",这一数字还在上升，并且上升的速度很快。这是足以让我们丢脸的。
"And not only that, we've used our imagination  to thoroughly trash this globe.",不仅如此，人类的想象力 还给地球带来了巨大的垃圾。
"Potable water, arable land,  rainforests, oil, gas:  they're going away, and they're going away soon,  and unless we innovate our way out of this mess,  we're going away too.",饮用水、可耕地、 热带雨林、石油、天然气， 这些资源都在消失，并且消失的速度也很快。 除非我们懂得去创新， 否则我们就没有任何希望了。
So the question is: Can we do that? And I think we can.,问题是：我们做得到吗？我想我们可以做到。
I think it's clear that we can make food  that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.,我认为我们可以生产出足以养活数十亿人的粮食， 而不会损害他们赖以生存的土地。
I think we can power this world with energy  that doesn't also destroy it.,我认为我们可以找到环境友好的能源 来供给世界能量。
"I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.",我确实是深信这样的理论的，这绝对不是臆想。
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night --  one of the things that keeps me up at night:  We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never.,但我总是遇到让我晚上睡不着觉的事情。 这是其中一个让我晚上睡不着的事情。 人类历史上从来没有象今天这样急需科技的进步
And we've also never been in a position  to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.,而历史上我们也从未有过像今天这样的时机， 我们可以按照我们的意愿去使用这些科技。
"We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events  in many fields,  and yet I actually think we'd have to go back  hundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,  to find a time when we battled progress,  when we fought about these things  more vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now.",在许多领域，我们都站在了惊人发现的 时代。 事实上，我认为我们需要往回看， 回到300年前，回到文艺复兴之前的年代， 只有在那个年代，才有人要抵抗进步， 才会有人比我们今天更加 猛烈的去反抗科技的进步。
"People wrap themselves in their beliefs,  and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.",人们总是喜欢把自己放在自己的理念框架里， 他们把自己包得那么死，往往无法脱身。
Not even the truth will set them free.,即使是听到了真理也不能使他们产生动摇。
"And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;  they're even entitled to their opinion about progress.",听着，每个人都可以坚持他的观点， 他们甚至可以坚持他们关于进步的观点，
But you know what you're not entitled to?,但你知道你不能坚持什么吗？
"You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not.",你不能只坚持你自己所知道的事实。真的，你不能。
And this took me awhile to figure out.,我也是花了一段时间才领悟出来的
"About a decade ago, I wrote a story about vaccines  for The New Yorker. A little story.",大约十年前，我给《纽约客》写了一个故事 一个关于疫苗小故事。
"And I was amazed to find opposition:  opposition to what is, after all,  the most effective public health measure in human history.",但我发现竟然有那么多人要反对我 他们反对的是 人类历史上最有效的公共卫生预防措施。
"I didn't know what to do,  so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.",我真的不知该怎么做， 我就只做自己该做的。故事写完，我就做别的事。
"And soon after that,  I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.",不久之后， 我写了一个关于转基因食物的文章。
"Same thing, only bigger.",又是收到了大量的反对，声浪大于上一次。
People were going crazy.,人们简直是发疯了。
"So I wrote a story about that too,  and I couldn't understand why  people thought this was ""Frankenfoods,""  why they thought moving molecules around  in a specific, rather than a haphazard way,  was trespassing on nature's ground.",于是我也就此写了一个文章， 我真的不能理解为何人们会把这理解为 “恶魔食物”， 我不理解，为何人们会认为按照特定的方式 而非任意的方式，来搬运生物分子 是在玩弄自然。
"But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.",不过我还是只做我该做的。故事写完后，我就不管它了。
"I mean, I'm a journalist.",我是个记者，
"We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.",我们的工作就是写文章，发表，吃饭，这就是我们的生活。
"But these stories bothered me,  and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.",但是这些见闻还是让我心里感到不舒服， 我也不知道是什么原因，直到后来我才知道。
And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy  weren't actually fanatics at all.,那些曾经把我逼疯的狂热分子 事实上并非狂热分子
"They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.",他们都是有想法的人，受过良好教育的人，正直的公民。
They were exactly like the people in this room.,他们就像这个房间里的人们。
And it just disturbed me so much.,这确实让我十分头疼，
"But then I thought, you know, let's be honest.",后来我想，说实话：
We're at a point in this world  where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.,我们今天的时代对于进步的关系 已经不同于往日了。
We talk about it ambivalently.,我们现在是以一种很疑惑的眼光来看待进步。
"We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:  ""progress.""",我们会以讽刺的口吻来谈论进步 并且会加上引号：“进步”。
"Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.",我想是有原因的，我们也知道是什么原因。
"We've lost faith in institutions,  in authority,  and sometimes in science itself,  and there's no reason we shouldn't have.",我们对于民间机构， 对政府， 有时甚至是对科学，已经失去了信任， 也许我们确实有不信任的理由。
You can just say a few names  and people will understand.,讲出几个名字你就知道 是什么原因了。
"Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,  Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction,  hanging chads.","切尔诺贝利，博帕尔，挑战者号， 还有Vioxx抗关节炎药, 大规模杀伤性武器， 半打出的选票。"
"You know, you can choose your list. There are questions and problems  with the people we used to believe were always right,  so be skeptical.",我想大家可以在自己心中把这样一个清单列出来。 我们过去完全信任的永远是对的， 现在都出问题了。 所以大家还是应当要有一点怀疑的态度。
"Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence.",要问几个问题，要索求证明和证据。
Don't take anything for granted.,凡事千万不能信以为真。
"But here's the thing: When you get proof,  you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.",但有一点需要注意，当你获得证据的时候， 你需要接受那样的证据，但我们并不善于这么做。
And the reason that I can say that is because  we're now in an epidemic of fear  like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.,原因，我认为是 我们现在都得了恐惧的传染病， 这样一种传染病之广度和深度是我从未经历的，更希望以后不会再次出现。
"About 12 years ago, there was a story published,  a horrible story,  that linked the epidemic of autism  to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.",12年前，媒体暴光了一则消息， 那是一个非常可怕的消息， 它将自闭症 与接受麻疹、腮腺炎和风疹疫苗注射关联在一起。
Very scary.,确实很可怕。
Tons of studies were done to see if this was true.,于是有大量的研究围绕这一事件而展开。
Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.,确实有必要做这些研究，因为那确实是一个严重的事件。
The data came back.,最后数据出来了。
"The data came back from the United States, from England,  from Sweden, from Canada,  and it was all the same: no correlation,  no connection, none at all.",来自美国、英国 瑞典、加拿大的数据验证了 同样的结论，即自闭症和疫苗二者之间没有关联， 没有任何联系，根本没有联系。
"It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter  because we believe anecdotes,  we believe what we see, what we think we see,  what makes us feel real.",但这个结果对于大众而言没有太大意义。 因为我们喜欢听小故事， 我们会相信我们眼睛看到的，相信我们内心认为我们看到的 相信那些让我们觉得真实的事情。
"We don't believe a bunch of documents  from a government official giving us data,  and I do understand that, I think we all do.",但就是不相信一堆的化验文件， 不相信来自政府部门的数据， 我也能理解这一点，我想我们所有人都有这样的心理。
But you know what?,但后果如何呢？
The result of that has been disastrous.,后果令人不堪设想，
Disastrous because here's a fact:  The United States is one of the only countries in the world  where the vaccine rate for measles is going down.,请听这个事实： 美国是世界上唯一一个 麻疹接种比例在下降的国家。
"That is disgraceful,  and we should be ashamed of ourselves.",这足以让我们感到羞辱， 我们应当为此感到惭愧。
It's horrible.,这是很可怕的事情。
What kind of a thing happened  that we could do that?,到底是因为什么 才使得这样的事情发生？
"Now, I understand it. I do understand it.",现在我明白了。真的明白了。
"Because, did anyone have measles here?",请问这里有人得过麻疹吗？
Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles?,你们当中有人看到别人因为患上了麻疹而死亡吗？
Doesn't happen very much.,不多、不多。
"Doesn't happen in this country at all,  but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.",事实上它也不会发生在这个国家， 但是，过去一年里，有16万人因为患有麻疹而死去。
That's a lot of death of measles --  20 an hour.,这个数字是巨大的， 基本是每个小时有20人因此而死去。
"But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,  and people like Jenny McCarthy  can go around preaching messages  of fear and illiteracy from platforms  like ""Oprah"" and ""Larry King Live.""",但是因为它不是发生在我们身边，我们可以不管这事情， 像Jenny McCarthy那样的人 则依然能够在 奥普拉和拉里金的节目上 传播他们的畏惧和无知信息。
And they can do it because  they don't link causation and correlation.,他们之所以这么做 是因为他们没有把原因与关联放在一起看。
"They don't understand that these things seem the same,  but they're almost never the same.",他们也不知道，那些看上去一样的东西 事实上从来都不是一样的。
"And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.",我们需要从中汲取经验教训，并且越早越好。
"This guy was a hero, Jonas Salk.",这位叫Jonas Salk的男士是一个英雄。
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.,因为他发明了小儿麻痹症的疫苗使得人们避免了这最严重的灾难。
"No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.",现在人们不需要去畏惧患上这一疾病了，也不会有患病带来的痛楚，小儿麻痹症消失了。
"That guy in the middle, not so much.",中间那个男人就不是那么风光了。
His name is Paul Offit.,他叫Paul Offit。
He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.,他与其他几位研究者一道发明了轮状病毒疫苗。
"It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids  in the developing world every year.",这一疫苗每一年可以拯救发展中国家 4亿50万孩子的生命。
"Pretty good, right?",应当是好事，不是吗？
"Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines  and says how valuable they are  and that people ought to just stop the whining.",确实是很好。这是Paul会四处跟人们讲这一疫苗， 说它们有多好， 并称人们从此可以告别苦楚。
And he actually says it that way.,他确实是这么说的。
"So, Paul's a terrorist.",因此，我们把Paul当成是恐怖主义分子。
"When Paul speaks in a public hearing,  he can't testify without armed guards.",当Paul要公开作证的时候， 他身边必须要有武装保安。
He gets called at home  because people like to tell him  that they remember where his kids go to school.,他在家里会接到恐吓电话 因为人们会跟他说 他们知道他孩子在哪里上学。
And why? Because Paul made a vaccine.,为什么？因为Paul发明了一种疫苗。
"I don't need to say this, but vaccines are essential.",我本不需要讲这个的，但疫苗确实是极其重要的。
"You take them away, disease comes back,  horrible diseases. And that's happening.",一旦停止疫苗注射，疾病又会卷土重来， 并且是非常可怕的疾病，这样的事情正在发生。
We have measles in this country now.,现在美国也出现麻疹了。
"And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids  are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.",并且情况变得越来越糟糕， 不久，就会有孩子因为患上这个病而死，这只是一个数字问题。
And they're not just going to die of measles.,不仅仅是麻疹呢。
What about polio? Let's have that. Why not?,还有小儿麻痹症，谁敢说它不会重新出现？
A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said  she thought I was a little strident.,我的一位大学同学几周前给我写了一封信， 她说我现在有点太过张扬了。
No one's ever said that before.,之前从来没有人这么说的。
"She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,  no way.",她说她不打算给孩子接种小儿麻痹症疫苗。 肯定不会。
Fine.,好吧。
Why? Because we don't have polio. And you know what?,为什么？因为这个国家没有小儿麻痹症。但你知道吗？
We didn't have polio in this country yesterday.,我们昨天没有这个传染病。
"Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,  and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.",今天，我不知道，也许一位嘉宾从拉各斯上飞机， 他的目的地是洛杉矶机场，现在已经到了俄亥俄州。

"And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,  and we don't either because that's the way the world works.",他不知道自己是感染了小儿麻痹症， 我们也不知道，这就是世界的事实。
That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't.,我们地球的事实就是这样的。不要以为不是。
"Now, we love to wrap ourselves in lies. We love to do it.",我们喜欢相信谎言。我们都很喜欢这么做。
Everyone take their vitamins this morning?,你们每个人早上都吃了维他命片吗？
"Echinacea, a little antioxidant  to get you going.",或者紫锥花，或者一点的抗氧化剂， 只有吃过那些你才感觉比较清醒。
I know you did because half of Americans do every day.,你之所以这么做，是因为每天有半数的美国人也这么做。
"They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,  and it doesn't matter how often  we find out that they're useless.",他们会吃这东西，，也会吃替代药物， 尽管我们已经知道 这些东西实际上是无效的。
The data says it all the time.,数据就是这么说的。
They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that.,吃这些只会使得你的尿液变黑。除此以外，它们不起任何作用。
"It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine?",假如你愿意花280亿美元来获得一些黑色的尿液，

"The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.",这个系统很卫生，它可以过滤这儿的水。
"So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,  not just a farm that measures its success  by the health of its predators,  but a farm that's literally a water purification plant --  and not just for those fish,  but for you and me as well.",所以，这个渔场不只是不喂动物， 不只是衡量它的成功 根据天敌的健康状况， 但是是一个渔场基本上还是个水净化厂， 而且不仅仅是为那些鱼， 更是为了你和我。
"Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.",因为当水离开这里时，它会流入大西洋。
"A drop in the ocean, I know,  but I'll take it, and so should you,  because this love story,  however romantic,  is also instructive.",我知道，这个作用是十分微薄的， 但是我很重视它，而且你们应该也是， 因为这个爱情故事， 不但浪漫， 而且有教育意义。
"You might say it's a recipe  for the future of good food,  whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.",你也许会说它是未来 美食的食谱， 不管是我们在说鲈鱼还是牛肉。

"But for a lot people,  that's a bit too radical.",但是对很多人来说， 那太极端了。
"We're not realists, us foodies;  we're lovers.",我们不是现实主义者，我们的美食家。 我们是爱人。
"We love farmers' markets,  we love small family farms,  we talk about local food,  we eat organic.",我们爱农产品市场。 我们爱小型的家庭式农场。 我们谈论区域性食品。 我们吃有机食品。
"And when you suggest these are the things  that will ensure the future of good food,  someone, somewhere stands up and says,  ""Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,  but how are you going to feed the world?""","然后当你建议这些食品 会保证未来的美食， 某人在某地站起来说， ""我说哥们，我爱粉色的火烈鸟， 但是你怎么让这个世界填饱肚子？"
How are you going to feed the world?,"你怎么为这个世界填饱肚子？"""
Can I be honest?,我可以坦诚点吗？
I don't love that question.,我不喜欢你的问题。
"No, not because we already produce  enough calories to more than feed the world.",不，不只是因为我们已经生产 了远远超出我们这个世界需要的卡路里。
One billion people will go hungry today.,今天十亿人还是在饿着肚子。
"One billion -- that's more than ever before --  because of gross inequalities in distribution,  not tonnage.",十亿--那比以前任何时候都多-- 根本原因在于总体上的分配不平衡， 不是按吨位算的。
"Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic  of our food system for the last 50 years.",我不喜欢这个问题的真正原因是因为他拟定了一个食物系统的 逻辑，一个存在于过去的50年中的逻辑。
"Feed grain to herbivores,  pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,  chicken to fish,  and all along agribusiness  has simply asked,  ""If we're feeding more people more cheaply,  how terrible could that be?""",把谷物喂给食草动物， 把农药给单品种作物，化学品给土壤， 把鸡给鱼， 然后各类农业可以 简单的问， “如果我们用更便宜的方法养活更多的人， 有什么不对的呢？”
"That's been the motivation,  it's been the justification:  it's been the business plan  of American agriculture.",那就是一个动机。 它已经变得合乎情理了。 它是一个商业计划 属于美国农业的。
"We should call it what it is:  a business in liquidation,  a business that's quickly eroding  ecological capital that makes that very production possible.",我们应该指出它的真面目， 一个在清算的生意， 一个迅速侵蚀的生意 生态资本使得这种生产成为可能。
"That's not a business,  and it isn't agriculture.",那不是一个生意， 它也不是农业。
"Our breadbasket is threatened today,  not because of diminishing supply,  but because of diminishing resources.",今天我们的食品正在受到威胁， 不是因为正在递减的供给， 而是因为正在递减的资源，
"Not by the latest combine and tractor invention,  but by fertile land;  not by pumps, but by fresh water;  not by chainsaws, but by forests;  and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.",不是靠最新的嫁接技术与拖拉机的发明， 而是肥沃的土壤， 不是靠水泵，而是靠新鲜的水源， 不是靠电锯，而是靠森林， 不是靠渔船和渔网，而是靠海洋里的鱼。
Want to feed the world?,想要喂饱这个世界？
Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?,让我们开始问：我们怎么去喂养我们自己？
Or better: How can we create conditions  that enable every community  to feed itself?,或者更好的，我们怎么去建立一种环境 它可以让每一个团体 去养活自己？
"To do that,  don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.",要做到那样， 不要指望未来沿用现在的农业模型。
"It's really old, and it's tired.",它已经过时了，而且很疲劳。
"It's high on capital, chemistry and machines,  and it's never produced anything really good to eat.",因为它过度依赖资本，化学，和机械， 而且它生产不出来真正的好食品。

"Look to Miguel,  farmers like Miguel.",看看米格尔， 看看像米格尔这样的农民，
"Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves;  farms that restore instead of deplete;  farms that farm extensively  instead of just intensively;  farmers that are not just producers,  but experts in relationships.",不只属于他们自己的农场， 它自我恢复，而不是消耗， 广义的农场 取代只是狭义的， 农民不再只是生产者， 而是关系专家，
"Because they're the ones  that are experts in flavor, too.",因为他们 同时也是口味上的专家。
"And if I'm going to be really honest,  they're a better chef than I'll ever be.",而且如果要我说实话， 他们是比我更好的厨师。

Thank you.,谢谢你们。
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.,我是在科幻小说的陪伴下长大的。
"In high school, I took a bus to school  an hour each way every day.",高中的时候，我每天要搭乘 一个小时的公交车往返学校。
"And I was always absorbed in a book,  science fiction book,  which took my mind to other worlds,  and satisfied, in a narrative form,  this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.",漫长车程中，我总是沉浸在书本里， 那些科幻小说 将我的思想带到其他的世界， 以叙事的方式， 满足了我当时强烈的好奇感。
"And you know, that curiosity also manifested itself  in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school  I was out in the woods,  hiking and taking ""samples"" --  frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water --  and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.",除此之外，我的好奇心也展现在其他方面： 每当我不需要上课的时候， 我总会前往树林里， 远足和采集“标本”， 青蛙呀、蛇呀、虫子呀、池水呀， 通通带回家中，放到显微镜下研究。
"You know, I was a real science geek.",我当时算得上是极品的科学狂人。
"But it was all about trying to understand the world,  understand the limits of possibility.",但这一切都是为了尝试了解这个世界， 了解可能的边界。
"And my love of science fiction  actually seemed mirrored in the world around me,  because what was happening, this was in the late '60s,  we were going to the moon,  we were exploring the deep oceans.",而我对科幻小说的喜爱 也是与我周围的世界相呼应的， 因为当时是60年代末期， 人类开始登月， 开始潜入深海。
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms  with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world  that we could never really have previously imagined.,雅克.格斯特将他神奇的视觉特效 带入我们的生活中，为我们呈现了 之前无法想象的动物、
"So, that seemed to resonate  with the whole science fiction part of it.",景观和一个美妙的世界。 这一切都似乎和科幻小说之间
And I was an artist.,产生着共鸣。 与此同时，我也是名艺术家。
I could draw. I could paint.,我能绘能画。
"And I found that because there weren't video games  and this saturation of CG movies and all of this  imagery in the media landscape,  I had to create these images in my head.",我也发现因为当时没有电子游戏、 特效电影的渗入以及现今传媒产业中 大量的图像化， 我不得不在我的头脑中来创造这些图像。
"You know, we all did, as kids having to  read a book, and through the author's description,  put something on the movie screen in our heads.",相信大家小时候都和我一样， 在读书的时候，往往会在我们大脑中 把作者所描述的东西向电影一样播放。
"And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw  alien creatures, alien worlds,  robots, spaceships, all that stuff.",而我对此的回应则是描绘 外星生物、外星世界、 机器人、宇宙飞船、等等。
I was endlessly getting busted in math class  doodling behind the textbook.,我躲在教科书后面涂鸦的行径 总是被数学老师给逮个正着。
That was -- the creativity  had to find its outlet somehow.,正因此，我不得不为我的创造力 寻求其他的宣泄途径。
And an interesting thing happened: The Jacques Cousteau shows  actually got me very excited about the fact that there was  an alien world right here on Earth.,有趣的是，雅克.格斯特的影片令我惊喜地发现 原来在这个地球上 就存在着一个外星世界。
I might not really go to an alien world  on a spaceship someday --  that seemed pretty darn unlikely.,我也许无法真的在有生之年 乘坐宇宙飞船前往外星世界。 这听起来太不着边际了。
"But that was a world I could really go to,  right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic  as anything that I had imagined from reading these books.",但这个地球上确实存在着一个 我真的可以前往的世界—— 富饶而奇异， 拥有着我通过书本所幻想的一切。
"So, I decided I was going to become a scuba diver  at the age of 15.",因此在我15岁的那一年，我决定成为一名 潜水员。
"And the only problem with that was that I lived  in a little village in Canada,  600 miles from the nearest ocean.",不过唯一的问题是，我当时 住在加拿大的一个小村庄里， 最近的海也要600英里远。
But I didn't let that daunt me.,但我却没有因此而心灰意冷。
"I pestered my father until he finally found  a scuba class in Buffalo, New York,  right across the border from where we live.",我反复纠缠我的老爸，直到他在 纽约水牛市为我找到了一个潜水训练班， 它就在美加边界的另一侧。
"in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter  in Buffalo, New York.",在基督教青年会的泳池内， 我拿到了我的潜水证书。
"And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,  until we moved to California.",但在随后的两年里， 我却不曾亲眼看见过大海， 直到我们搬到了加利福尼亚洲。
"Since then, in the intervening  40 years,  I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,  and 500 hours of that was in submersibles.",在那之后 的40年里， 我在水下度过了大概3000个小时。 其中500个小时是在潜水器中度过的。
"And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,  and even the shallow oceans,  are so rich with amazing life  that really is beyond our imagination.",我发现深海之中── 即使是浅海之中── 充满了令人惊奇的生命， 远远超出了我们的想象。 同我们人类狭隘的想象范围相比
Nature's imagination is so boundless  meager human imagination.,大自然的想象力 是无边无际的。
"I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe  of what I see when I make these dives.",直到今日，我潜水时所目睹的一切 仍令我感到无比惊奇。
"And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,  and just as strong as it ever was.",我对海洋的热爱 始终如一、不曾改变。
"But when I chose a career as an adult,  it was filmmaking.",但当我长大成人，需要择业的时候， 我选择了电影制作。
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile  this urge I had to tell stories  with my urges to create images.,在当时看来，这是将我 讲故事的渴求与创造图象的欲望 合二为一的最好途径。
"And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.",在我还是个孩子的时候，我常常画漫画。
"So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories  together, and that made sense.",而电影制作正好将图象和故事结合在一起。 理所当然，水到渠成。
"And of course the stories that I chose to tell  were science fiction stories: ""Terminator,"" ""Aliens""  and ""The Abyss.""",当然了，我讲的故事都是些科幻故事 《终结者》《异性》 和《深渊》。
"And with ""The Abyss,"" I was putting together my love  of underwater and diving with filmmaking.",在《深渊》中，我将我对深海和潜水的喜爱 与电影制作结合到了一起。
"So, you know, merging the two passions.",将两份热忱，合二为一。
"Something interesting came out of ""The Abyss,""  which was that to solve a specific narrative  problem on that film,  which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,  we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.",而《深渊》也带来了另一种启迪： 为了更好的呈现 影片的叙事模式， 创造出影片中的液体水生物， 我们开始使用电脑动画技术。
"And this resulted in the first soft-surface  character, CG animation  that was ever in a movie.",电影业中的首个 电脑制作的软表面人物 也因此而诞生。
"And even though the film didn't make any money --  barely broke even, I should say --  I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,  the global audience, was mesmerized  by this apparent magic.",尽管那部电影票房不济， 刚好回本罢了， 我却因此而目睹了令人惊奇的一幕── 全球观众都被影片所呈现的魔法 深深吸引。
"You know, it's Arthur Clarke's law  that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.",这就是阿瑟·克拉克定律── 先进的科技和魔法之间是难以区分的。
They were seeing something magical.,而当时观众所目睹的正是这种魔力。
And so that got me very excited.,这令我感到无比兴奋。
"And I thought, ""Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced  into the cinematic art.""",我当时想到，“天呀，这项技术需要在电影艺术中 大范围推广。”
"So, with ""Terminator 2,"" which was my next film,  we took that much farther.",所以在我的下一部电影《终结者2》中， 我们将这项技术推上了新的台阶。
"Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude  in that film. The success hung in the balance  on whether that effect would work.",通过和“工业光魔”电影特效公司的合作，我们创造了影片中那个 液体金属家伙。而电影的成功与否 将取决于这项技术能否奏效。
"And it did, and we created magic again,  and we had the same result with an audience --  although we did make a little more money on that one.",结果它奏效了。我们再次创造了魔法。 我们再次从观众那里得到了同样的回馈。 不过那部电影的票房要稍微好一点。
"So, drawing a line through those two dots  of experience  came to, ""This is going to be a whole new world,""  this was a whole new world of creativity  for film artists.",综合这两次经历， 我们意识到 这将是一个全新的世界 一个容许电影艺术者们施展想象力的 全新世界。
"So, I started a company with Stan Winston,  my good friend Stan Winston,  who is the premier make-up and creature designer  at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.","所以我和我的好友Stan Winston 成立了一家公司。 Stan Winston是当时的知名化妆师和造型师。 公司的名字就叫做""数码领域""。"
"And the concept of the company was  that we would leapfrog past  the analog processes of optical printers and so on,  and we would go right to digital production.",而公司的理念就是 蛙跳过去光学打印机等等的 模拟过程， 直接转入数码制作。
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.,事实上我们的确做到了这一点，使得我们在一段时间内占据了先机。
But we found ourselves lagging in the mid '90s  in the creature and character design stuff  that we had actually founded the company to do.,但在90年代中叶，我们发现虽然公司的初衷 是在生物、人物设计方面有所建树， 但我们在这一方面却是落伍了。
"So, I wrote this piece called ""Avatar,""  which was meant to absolutely push the envelope  of visual effects,  of CG effects, beyond,  with realistic human emotive characters generated in CG,  and the main characters would all be in CG,  and the world would be in CG.",因此我创作了这个《阿凡达》的作品， 旨在将视觉效果 和电脑特效 推向极限， 利用电脑动画制造出 具有真实人类情感的生物。 主要角色将由电脑制作。 整个场景将由电脑制作。
"And the envelope pushed back,  and I was told by the folks at my company  that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.",但我却碰了一鼻子灰。 我们公司里的人告诉我说 我们在当时的技术条件下，是无法完成这样的特效的。
"So, I shelved it, and I made this other movie about a big ship that sinks.",所以我将这个想法放置一旁，转而制作了一部关于大船沉入海底的电影。
"You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as ""'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:  ""It's going to be this epic romance,  passionate film.""",我当时跟电影公司说这部电影将会是船上的“罗密欧与朱丽叶”， 将会是一部史诗般的、 浪漫激情的电影。
"Secretly, what I wanted to do was  I wanted to dive to the real wreck of ""Titanic.""",但私底下，我的真实动机 是去拜访一下泰坦尼克的残骸。
And that's why I made the movie.,这才是我制作那部电影的原因。
"And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.",我说的是事实。不过电影公司当时是不知情的。
"But I convinced them. I said,  ""We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.",我说服了他们。我说： “我们将潜入船骸，实地取景，
We'll be using it in the opening of the film.,作为影片的开场。
"It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook.""",此事至关重要、极具噱头。”
And I talked them into funding an expedition.,于是我说服了他们投资于一场冒险历程。
Sounds crazy. But this goes back to that theme  about your imagination creating a reality.,听起来很疯狂。但这件事归根结底，依旧是关于 如果用你的想像力来创造一个现实。
"Because we actually created a reality where six months later,  I find myself in a Russian submersible  two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,  looking at the real Titanic through a view port.",事实上，我们的确在六个月后创造了一个现实── 我在北大西洋2.5英里水下， 身处一个俄罗斯潜水器中， 通过一个视口观望真正的泰坦尼克。
"Not a movie, not HD -- for real.",不是电影，不是高清，而是身临其境。
"Now, that blew my mind.",那次经历令我大为惊叹。
"And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras  and lights and all kinds of things.",前期的准备工作是很繁琐的，我们需要搭建摄像机、 灯光等等。
"But, it struck me how much  this dive, these deep dives,  was like a space mission.",但真正让我震惊的是 这些深海潜水活动 就如宇宙探险一样。
"You know, where it was highly technical,  and it required enormous planning.",两者都是高科技产物， 两者都需要缜密的部署。
"You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark  hostile environment  if you can't get back by yourself.",你踏进船舱，踏入这漆黑 险恶的环境， 如果你无法依靠自己的力量返回的话， 你是没有任何被营救的可能的。
"And I thought like, ""Wow. I'm like,  living in a science fiction movie.",我当时想到：“天呀。我就好像 活在一个科幻电影里面一样。
"This is really cool.""",太酷了！”
"And so, I really got bitten by the bug of deep-ocean exploration.",正因此，深海探险成了我新的嗜好。
"Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it --  it was everything. It was adventure,  it was curiosity, it was imagination.",当然了，这归结于其中的好奇感、科学性。 它是万物合一、是探求未知、 是好奇无边、是想象无限，
Hollywood couldn't give me.,是好莱坞无法给予我的 难得经历。
"Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could  create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing  out that window.",虽然我可以想象出一个生物，然后利用电脑特效将它创造出来， 但我却无法想象出那天我透过潜水窗 所看到的一切。
"As we did some of our subsequent expeditions,  I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents  and sometimes things that I had never seen before,  sometimes things that no one had seen before,  that actually were not described by science  at the time that we saw them and imaged them.",在我们随后的探险过程中， 我观测到过居住在热液喷口的生物， 有时会看到我之前从来没有看过的东西， 有时会看到任何人之前都没有看过的东西， 甚至是一些在我们当时目击并记录之前 还没有被科学所描述的事物。
"So, I was completely smitten by this,  and had to do more.",正因此，我对此是神魂颠倒， 不得不继续下去。
"And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.",于是我做出了一个令人惊讶的决定。
"After the success of ""Titanic,""  I said, ""OK, I'm going to park my day job  as a Hollywood movie maker,  and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while.""",在《泰坦尼克号》取得成功之后， 我决定：“好吧，我在好莱坞制作电影的工作 到这里就可以告一段落了。 在接下来的一段时间里，我要成为一名全职探险家。”
"And so, we started planning these  expeditions.",因此，我们开始计划 这些探险活动。
"And we wound up going to the Bismark,  and exploring it with robotic vehicles.",我们前往俾斯麦沉船， 利用机器人装置来探测它的残骸。
We went back to the Titanic wreck.,我们随后又回到了泰坦尼克的残骸。
We took little bots that we had created  that spooled a fiber optic.,并且创造出了一批可以 缠绕光学纤维的机器人。
"And the idea was to go in and do an interior  survey of that ship, which had never been done.",目的就是深入到残骸中，探索其内部的样子 ──一个前无古人的做法。
"Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,  so we created technology to do it.",在此之前，没有人看过残骸的内部。他们没有所需要的技术， 所以我们就创造出相应的技术。
"So, you know, here I am now, on the deck  of Titanic, sitting in a submersible,  and looking out at planks that look much like this,  where I knew that the band had played.",要知道，我当时就在泰坦尼克的甲板上， 坐在一个潜水器内， 看着就如同这个的木质甲板， 心想着曾在这里表演的乐队。
And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle  through the corridor of the ship.,我操控着一个小型的机器人探索器 飞过船内的走廊。
"When I say, ""I'm operating it,""  but my mind is in the vehicle.",虽然我在操控着它， 我的思想却是在这个探索器内，
I felt like I was physically present  inside the shipwreck of Titanic.,我感觉我确确实实地 置身在泰坦尼克的残骸中。
"And it was the most surreal kind  of deja vu experience I've ever had,  because I would know before I turned a corner  what was going to be there before the lights  of the vehicle actually revealed it,  because I had walked the set for months  when we were making the movie. And the set was based as an exact replica  on the blueprints of the ship.",那是我所经历过的最难以置信的 此曾相识的感觉， 因为在机器人的探测灯照亮周围之前， 我就已经知道每个转角背后 所隐藏的一切， 原因就在于电影制作的过程中， 我花费了很多个月的时间在这个场景中走来走去。 而摄影棚中的道具就是依照这个船的设计图 所制造出来的一个真实模型。
"So, it was this absolutely remarkable experience.",所以那一次的经历是非比寻常的，
"And it really made me realize that  the telepresence experience --  that you actually can have these robotic avatars,  then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,  into this other form of existence.",它使我感受到了一种 远程监控的经历── 我们甚至上拥有这些机器人形态的阿凡达， 我们将我们的思想意识注入其中， 注入另外一种存在形式中。
"It was really, really quite profound.",这的确是很深刻的感受。
"And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening  some decades out  as we start to have cyborg bodies  for exploration or for other means  in many sort of  post-human futures  that I can imagine,  So, having done these expeditions,  and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,  such as at the deep ocean vents  where we had these amazing, amazing animals --",也许这一切可以让我们大致猜想几十年后的世界 会是怎样。 作为一名科学小说迷 我可以想象各种 后人类社会的未来， 利用半机械人 来进行探险 以及其他活动。 所以通过这些探险 我开始真正地欣赏海底的美妙， 比如那些生活在深海裂口处的 奇妙的动物们。
they're basically aliens right here on Earth.,它们算得上就是地球上的外星生物。
They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.,它们住在一个化学合成的环境中，
They don't survive on sunlight-based  system the way we do.,完全不需要我们赖以生存的 太阳光照。 所以当你看到那些
"And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to  water plumes.",生活在500度高温的海底地柱周边的 动物的时候，
You think they can't possibly exist.,你觉得它们完全不可能存活。
"At the same time  I was getting very interested in space science as well --  again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.",与此同时， 我也开始对太空科技感兴趣。 这自然也是受到了年少时候科学小说的影响。
"And I wound up getting involved with  the space community,  really involved with NASA,  sitting on the NASA advisory board,  planning actual space missions,  going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut  biomedical protocols,  and all these sorts of things,  to actually go and fly to the international space station  with our 3D camera systems.",结果我和太空社区建立了 很紧密的联系， 和美国航天局合作， 成为了他们咨询委员会的一员， 策划真正的太空任务， 前往俄罗斯，参观宇航员之前的 生物科学协议 等等一系列的事情 以便于我们带着我们的3D摄影器材 前往国际空间站。
And this was fascinating.,这种经历是令人难忘的。
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists  with us into the deep.,但我到头来所做的，却是说服太空科学家们 跟随我们前往海洋深处，
"And taking them down so that they had access --  astrobiologists, planetary scientists,  people who were interested in these extreme environments --  taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,  and take samples and test instruments, and so on.",让他们可以切身体验。 太空生物学家、天体科学家 等等对极端环境感兴趣的人们 都被我们带到深海裂口处，让他们能亲眼观看、 采取样品、探测仪器等等。
"So, here we were making documentary films,  but actually doing science,  and actually doing space science.",所以我们在制作记录片的同时 却是在研究科学 研究太空科学。
"I'd completely closed the loop  between being the science fiction fan,  and doing this stuff for real.",我把小时候 身为科学小说迷的经历 和真实从事这一行业的经历
"And you know, along the way in this journey  of discovery,  I learned a lot.",联系到了一起。 在这个探索之旅中， 我也是 学到了很多东西。
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot  about leadership.,我学到了很多关于科学的东西。但我也学会了很多 关于领袖才能的东西。
"Now you think director has got to be a leader,  leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.",你觉得导演必须得是一名领袖人才， 是领导、是掌舵者之类的。 但在这些探险之前，
I didn't really learn about leadership until I did these expeditions.,我对领袖才能却是一无所知。
"Because I had to, at a certain point, say,  ""What am I doing out here?",因为我终究要问自己： “我到底在做些什么呢？
"Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?""",我为什么要做这些事情？我从中得到什么呢？”
We don't make money at these damn shows.,这些该死的纪录片根本不赚钱。
We barely break even. There is no fame in it.,我们想回本都不容易。没名没份的。
"People sort of think I went away between ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"" and was buffing my nails  someplace, sitting at the beach.",很多人都认为我在《泰坦尼克》和《阿凡达》两部电影之间 退居幕后，坐在沙滩上面 修指甲罢了。
"Made all these films, made all these documentary films  for a very limited audience.",但事实上我制作了这些电影，这些纪录片， 只有很少数的观众看过。
"No fame, no glory, no money. What are you doing?",没名、没份、没钱。你到底在做什么呢？
"You're doing it for the task itself,  for the challenge --  and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is --  for the thrill of discovery, and for that strange bond that happens  when a small group of people form a tightly knit team.",我做这一切是为了这个经历本身的价值 为了这个挑战── 而大海就是最富挑战的环境， 我做这一切也是为了探索发现的惊奇感， 为了那种一小群人组成一个紧密的团队时 所撞击出的奇妙的凝聚力。
"Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people,  working for years at a time,  sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.",因为每一次我们都会和10到12个人 一起工作上几个年头。 有时要在海上呆上个2-3个月。
"And in that bond, you realize  that the most important thing  is the respect that you have for them  and that they have for you, that you've done a task  that you can't explain to someone else.",而在那种凝聚力下，你意识到 最重要的事情 就是你与他们 彼此之间的尊敬，你们共同完成了一个 无法向他人解释的任务。
"When you come back to the shore and you say,  ""We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,  and the this and the that,  all the technology of it, and the difficulty,  the human-performance aspects of working at sea,""  you can't explain it to people.

So this is really important because this is an insight  that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.,这是很重要的 因为这是一项 不属于任何一个维基网页所载述的内容。
It's only possible to see that insight  when you step back and look at all of them.,只有你退后几步俯瞰全局 才有可能看的透彻

I'm just showing the New York Times website here.,我只是在这展示纽约时报网站。
"So Pivot, this application --  I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,  but you can view web pages with it --  and we bring that zoomable technology  to every single web page like this.",Pivot，这个应用程序—— 我不想称之为浏览器，它确实不仅是一个浏览器， 你能用它浏览网页—— 并且我们给每个像这样的网页引入了可缩放技术。 并且我们给每个像这样的网页引入了可缩放技术。
"So I can step back,  pop right back into a specific section.",因此我可以退后， 退后到特定的地方
"Now the reason why this is important is because,  by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,  I can look at my entire browsing history  in the exact same way.",为什么这个是重要的是因为， 由于通过这种方式浏览网页的好处， 我能用完全相同的方式 看到我的全部浏览历史。
So I can drill into what I've done  over specific time frames.,因此我能深入 具体时间段的具体事件。
"Here, in fact, is the state  of all the demo that I just gave.",这里，事实上， 是我刚才所有演示的情况。
And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.,我可以在某种程度上重放我今天早些时候看到的东西。

We talk about the curse of information overload.,我们谈论信息爆炸魔咒。
We talk about drowning in data.,我们谈论淹没在信息海洋中。

Everybody talks about happiness these days.,最近大家都在谈论着快乐。
"I had somebody count the number of books  with ""happiness"" in the title published in the last five years  and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.",在过去的五年里，我请人数了近年来有多本书的 书名中提到“快乐”， 他们数到大约有40本，而且还有更多没数到的。
"There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,  among researchers.",现今越来越多研究者都开始对快乐 这个议题产生兴趣。
There is a lot of happiness coaching.,而且还有很多的“快乐教练”授课。
Everybody would like to make people happier.,让其他人更快乐是他们的宗旨。
"But in spite of all this flood of work,  there are several cognitive traps  that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight  about happiness.",虽然此类工作多如牛毛， 但现仍存在几个认知上的陷阱， 这些陷阱将会增加使人领悟 快乐本质的难度。
And my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps.,我今天将主要谈论这些认知陷阱。
"This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,  and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,  because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.",这些陷阱既会影响到一般人对自身快乐的观感， 而且也会影响到学者对快乐的判断， 因为人无完人，我们皆会出错。
The first of these traps  is a reluctance to admit complexity.,第一个陷阱是 不愿意去承认快乐的复杂性。
"It turns out that the word ""happiness""  is just not a useful word anymore,  because we apply it to too many different things.",事实证明快乐这个词 已不再是常用词汇了， 因为我们已用其来诠释太多的事物了。
"I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,  but by and large,  this is something that we'll have to give up  and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view  of what well-being is.",我想我们应该限定它的意思， 不过，一般而言， 我们得放弃这个想法 并用更复杂的观点来看 何谓快乐生活。
"The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;  basically, it's between being happy in your life,  and being happy about your life  or happy with your life.",第二个陷阱是经验和记忆间的混淆： 基本上这是在生活中体会快乐 和觉得生活很快乐 以及对于你的生活满意之间的差别。
"And those are two very different concepts,  and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.",这两者的意义相距甚远， 且在论及快乐时会混为一谈。
"And the third is the focusing illusion,  and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance  that affects well-being  without distorting its importance.",第三个陷阱则是聚焦错觉， 令人遗憾的是，任何情况下，当我们想到一些 关于快乐生活的情景时， 我们势必会觉得它特别重要。
"I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.",我的意思是，这是一个真正的认知陷阱。
There's just no way of getting it right.,它避无可避。
"Now, I'd like to start with an example  of somebody who had a question-and-answer session  after one of my lectures reported a story,  and that was a story --  He said he'd been listening to a symphony,  and it was absolutely glorious music  and at the very end of the recording,  there was a dreadful screeching sound.",现在，我想以一个例子来开头， 有个人上过我的课后 于答问之时向我讲述了一则故事。 [不清...] 他说他有次在听交响乐时 觉得音乐真是动听极了， 但在演奏快结束之时， 却冒出了尖锐刺耳的声音。
"And then he added, really quite emotionally,  it ruined the whole experience.",接着他激动地表示 这就是一只老鼠坏了一锅粥。
But it hadn't.,但事实并非如此。
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.,所发生的糟糕印象仅仅是对这段经验的记忆。
He had had the experience.,他经历了这段经验。
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.,他也经历了20分钟的听觉盛会。
"They counted for nothing  because he was left with a memory;  the memory was ruined,  and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.",但现在都已无足轻重了， 因为他仅留下一段记忆； 就是那段糟糕的记忆， 而其它20分钟的盛会则被完全遗忘了。
"What this is telling us, really,  is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people  in terms of two selves.",这告诉我们， 我们在思考自己和别人时， 用了两种自我。
"There is an experiencing self,  who lives in the present  and knows the present,  is capable of re-living the past,  but basically it has only the present.",第一种则为经验自我， 这种自我活在当下， 洞察当下， 同时也能回味过往， 但基本上他只属于当下。
"It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --  you know, when the doctor asks,  ""Does it hurt now when I touch you here?""",一般医生接触的皆是经验自我-- 正如，当医生问你， “我碰你这里时会疼么？”
"And then there is a remembering self,  and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,  and maintains the story of our life,  and it's the one that the doctor approaches  in asking the question,  ""How have you been feeling lately?""",另一个自我则是记忆自我， 他负责记录生活， 抒写生活故事， 医生要找他时 会这么问， “最近感觉如何？”
"or ""How was your trip to Albania?"" or something like that.",或“去阿尔巴尼亚好玩么？”等类似的问题。
"Those are two very different entities,  the experiencing self and the remembering self,  and getting confused between them is part of the mess  about the notion of happiness.",经验自我和记忆自我 是截然不同的， 两者的混淆是导致我们不懂快乐的 部分原因。
"Now, the remembering self  is a storyteller.",记忆自我 负责讲述故事。
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --  it starts immediately.,故事从记忆中直接撷取-- 即时上传。
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.,并不是我们在讲我们要讲的故事。
"Our memory tells us stories,  that is, what we get to keep from our experiences  is a story.",是我们的记忆在讲故事， 它是我们从经验中储存下来的 故事。
And let me begin with one example.,让我用一个例子开始。
This is an old study.,这是一个古老的研究。
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.,一些真正的病人将会接受一种痛苦的治疗方法。
"I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,  but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.",细节不再详述。现今的疗法已不再如此难受， 但在研究进行的九十年代时，这种方法令人痛不欲生。
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.,病人每隔六十秒则必须报告他们的痛苦指数。
"Here are two patients,  those are their recordings.",这边有两位病患。 这是他们的记录。
"And you are asked, ""Who of them suffered more?""",我问你：“在他们之中谁最痛苦？”
And it's a very easy question.,这个问题很简单。
"Clearly, Patient B suffered more --  his colonoscopy was longer,  and every minute of pain that Patient A had,  Patient B had, and more.",显然，是病人B。 他的结肠镜检查时间较长， 病人A每分钟感觉的痛疼 病人B也感觉到了，而且持续更久。
"But now there is another question:  ""How much did these patients think they suffered?""",但现在还有另一个问题： 这些患者认为他们受罪了吗？
And here is a surprise.,这里有个小意外：
The surprise is that Patient A  had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy  than Patient B.,令人惊讶的是病人A 对结肠镜检查的记忆比病人B 还糟糕。
"The stories of the colonoscopies were different,  and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.",两段结肠镜检查的故事不同， 这关键在于故事的结尾--
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --  but one of them is this distinct ...   but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.,两个故事都不怎么启迪智慧-- 但两者显然是不同的... 显然其中之一的感受比另一个还差。
And the one that is worse  is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;  it's a bad story.,感觉较糟的这一个 是在最后的时期里知晓什么是痛绝人寰。 这不是个好故事。
How do we know that?,我们是怎么知道的？
"Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,  and much later, too,  ""How bad was the whole thing, in total?""",因为我们在检查结束后问他们， 以及在很久之后再问一次他们， “你们对结肠镜检查的整体印象如何？”
"And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.",结果是A的记忆感觉明显要比B更糟糕。
Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self.,现在这是经验自我和记忆自我
"From the point of view of the experiencing self,  clearly, B had a worse time.",之间的直接冲突。 从经验自我的角度来看， 病人B显然是比较难受的。
"Now, what you could do with Patient A,  and we actually ran clinical experiments,  and it has been done, and it does work --  you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A  by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.",那么病人A的情况该如何解释， 我们实际做了一个临床试验， 当实验完成时，我们也得到了预期的结果， 事实上我们可以延长病人A的检查时间 从而减缓导管的震动程度。
"That will cause the patient  to suffer, but just a little  and much less than before.",虽然病人还是会疼， 但已减轻 许多了。
"And if you do that for a couple of minutes,  you have made the experiencing self  of Patient A worse off,  and you have the remembering self of Patient A  a lot better off,  because now you have endowed Patient A  with a better story  about his experience.",假如继续这样下去， 你将会使病人A的经验自我的 感觉更糟， 但病人A的记忆自我 则会感觉好多了， 因为你给了病人A 一个好一点的故事， 一个好一点记忆他病痛经历的故事。
What defines a story?,怎样给故事定义好坏？
"And that is true of the stories  that memory delivers for us,  and it's also true of the stories that we make up.",并且记忆告诉我们的故事 是真实的， 我们讲述的故事也是真的。
"What defines a story are changes,  significant moments and endings.",故事的好坏取决于高潮时分 及结尾时刻。
"Endings are very, very important  and, in this case, the ending dominated.",结尾是非常重要的， 上面的这个故事就是由结尾所主导的。
"Now, the experiencing self  lives its life continuously.",现在，经验自我 延续这个生活经验。
"It has moments of experience, one after the other.",他也拥有片刻的经验，一个接一个。
And you can ask: What happens to these moments?,你会问：“这些片刻怎么了？”
And the answer is really straightforward:  They are lost forever.,答案很简单。 他们永远消失了。
"I mean, most of the moments of our life --  and I calculated, you know, the psychological present  is said to be about three seconds long;  that means that, you know,  in a life there are about 600 million of them;  in a month, there are about 600,000 --  most of them don't leave a trace.",我们生活中的大多片刻-- 我算了算--从心理学角度来说 仅仅只是三秒长。 这意味着 人一生中大约有六亿个片刻。 一个月里则大约有六十万个片刻。 它们大多不留痕迹。
Most of them are completely ignored  by the remembering self.,大多数皆被记忆自我 全然忽视了。
"And yet, somehow you get the sense  that they should count,  that what happens during these moments of experience  is our life.",然而，你现在亦应发现 一些感觉被储存， 因为我们经验中的每分每秒合在一起 就构成了我们的人生。
"It's the finite resource that we're spending  And how to spend it  would seem to be relevant,  but that is not the story  that the remembering self keeps for us.",只要我们活着， 我们就会消耗这些有限的资源。 该如何使用它们， 似乎是很重要的， 但这不是记忆自我 所留给我们的故事。
"So we have the remembering self  and the experiencing self,  and they're really quite distinct.",因此记忆自我 和经验自我 是很好区别的。
The biggest difference between them  is in the handling of time.,他们之间的最大不同 是在于处理时间的方式。
"From the point of view of the experiencing self,  if you have a vacation,  and the second week is just as good as the first,  then the two-week vacation  is twice as good as the one-week vacation.",就经验自我而言， 如果你有一个假期， 第二周和第一周同等快乐， 那么两周下来 快乐的分量是一周假期的两倍多。
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.,然而记忆自我则不是这样算的。
"For the remembering self, a two-week vacation  is barely better than the one-week vacation  because there are no new memories added.",对记忆自我来说，两周假期 并不比一周假期多多少， 因为期间没有任何新记忆的加入。
You have not changed the story.,故事的剧情依然如旧。
"And in this way,  time is actually the critical variable  that distinguishes a remembering self  from an experiencing self;  time has very little impact on the story.",因此 时间是区分 记忆自我和经验自我的 关键因素。 时间对这个故事的影响不大。
"Now, the remembering self does more  than remember and tell stories.",记忆自我所做的 不仅是记忆和讲述故事。
"It is actually the one that makes decisions  because, if you have a patient who has had, say,  two colonoscopies with two different surgeons  and is deciding which of them to choose,  then the one that chooses  is the one that has the memory that is less bad,  and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.",它也是真正做决定的因素， 因为，假若你的病人已经历 过两位不同的外科医生来做胃肠镜检查， 而现在决定从他们中选一位来再做检查时， 病人选的将会是 记忆中感觉比较好的那位， 这就是如何选定医生的。
The experiencing self  has no voice in this choice.,经验自我 在做选择是则无从置喙。
"We actually don't choose between experiences,  we choose between memories of experiences.",事实上，我们不会在两段经验中做选择。 我们是在两种不同经验的记忆中做出选择。
"And even when we think about the future,  we don't think of our future normally as experiences.",而且当我们设想未来时， 一般我们不会以经验的形式去思考。
We think of our future  as anticipated memories.,我们把未来 以预想的记忆形式呈现。
"And basically you can look at this,  you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,  and you can think of the remembering self  sort of dragging the experiencing self  through experiences that  the experiencing self doesn't need.",大体上你可以看到， 记忆自我是专制的， 你可以想象记忆自我 在拽着经验自我， 他是通过经验自我不要的经验 来拽着经验自我的。
"I have that sense that  when we go on vacations  this is very frequently the case;  that is, we go on vacations,  to a very large extent,  in the service of our remembering self.",我有个想法， 当我们放假时 往往 之所以放假， 有很大一部分 是为了记忆自我。
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.,我想这有点难来辩证。
"I mean, how much do we consume our memories?",我们使用了多少的记忆？
That is one of the explanations  that is given for the dominance  of the remembering self.,这可以解释 记忆自我 为何能成为主导的自我。
"And when I think about that, I think about a vacation  we had in Antarctica a few years ago,  which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,  and I think of it relatively often,  relative to how much I think of other vacations.",这让我想起一次假期， 几年前在南极度过的假期， 这可以说是我最棒的一个假期， 与其它假期相比， 我常常会想起这个假期。
"And I probably have consumed  my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,  for about 25 minutes in the last four years.",这趟旅程大概让我用掉了 三周的记忆量， 大概仅在过去四年中占了约25分钟。
"Now, if I had ever opened the folder  with the 600 pictures in it,  I would have spent another hour.",现在，如我打开资料夹 里面大概有600张相片， 我可能要花一个小时来回忆。
"Now, that is three weeks,  and that is at most an hour and a half.",三周的旅程 最多只用一个半小时来回忆。
There seems to be a discrepancy.,这似乎不成比例啊。
"Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,  in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,  but even if you do more of this,  there is a genuine question:  Why do we put so much weight on memory  relative to the weight that we put on experiences?",这让我有点不满， 因为我记得真是太少了， 不过就算你记得再多 这里也会有个实际的问题。 为什么我们用来记忆 比依赖经验还多？
So I want you to think  about a thought experiment.,所以我希望你能思考 一个有关思考的实验。
"Imagine that for your next vacation,  you know that at the end of the vacation  all your pictures will be destroyed,  and you'll get an amnesic drug  so that you won't remember anything.",假使你的下一个假期， 当你知道假期结束后 假期中所有的相片将被销毁时， 而你也会吞下一颗遗忘药 以使你遗忘一切。
"Now, would you choose the same vacation?   And if you would choose a different vacation,  there is a conflict between your two selves,  and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,  and it's actually not at all obvious, because  if you think in terms of time,  then you get one answer,  and if you think in terms of memories,  you might get another answer.",这样，你还会想过同样的假期么？ 如果你选了个不同的假期， 你的两个自我之间将会产生冲突， 你得想法来裁决这场冲突， 这并不怎么容易， 因为假若你仅考虑时间 你会得到一个答案。 但若仅考虑记忆 你会得到另外一个答案。
Why do we pick the vacations we do  is a problem that confronts us  with a choice between the two selves.,我们为什么要选此而非彼， 这个困扰我们的问题 是需要在两个自我之间作出选择。
"Now, the two selves  bring up two notions of happiness.",现在，两个自我 带来对快乐的两种不同见解。
"There are really two concepts of happiness  that we can apply, one per self.",这两种对快乐的见解 分别对应了两个自我。
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?,因此你会问：“经验自我是有多快乐？”
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments  in the experiencing self's life?,接着你会问：“经验自我的每一刻 有多快乐？”
And they're all -- happiness for moments  is a fairly complicated process.,这些快乐时刻的组成过程 是异常复杂的。
What are the emotions that can be measured?,情感该如何测量？
"And, by the way, now we are capable  of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.",顺带一提，我们现在 对于经验自我会随着时间而感受快乐 已经有了一个粗浅的概念了。
"If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,  it's a completely different thing.",而记忆自我所指的快乐 则是完全两码事。
This is not about how happily a person lives.,这并不是一个人生活多快乐的问题。
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is  when that person thinks about her life.,而是它对自己的人生 有多满意和多喜欢的问题。
Very different notion.,迥然不同的见解。
"Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions  is going to mess up the study of happiness,  and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,  who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time  in precisely this way.",若不能分辨这两种见解 就无法参透快乐这门学问， 我和其他活得好的学生一样， 一直以来都研究不透快乐， 就是因为这个原因。
"The distinction between the  happiness of the experiencing self  and the satisfaction of the remembering self  has been recognized in recent years,  and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.",近年来， 经验自我的快乐 和记忆自我的满足的 差异性已能分清， 目前正努力来分别测度两者，
"The Gallup Organization has a world poll  where more than half a million people  have been asked questions  about what they think of their life  and about their experiences,  and there have been other efforts along those lines.",盖洛普公司最近在全世界举行了一场民意调查， 其中逾五十万人 都被问及一个类似的问题， 那就是他们如何看待他们的生活 和如何看待他们的经验。 除了这个问题，这个公司还做了其它的调查。
"So in recent years, we have begun to learn  about the happiness of the two selves.",近年来，我们逐渐得知 关于两种快乐见解的信息。
And the main lesson I think that we have learned  is they are really different.,我认为我们主要学到的便是 两者是天壤之别的。
"You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,  and that really doesn't teach you much  about how happily they're living their life,  and vice versa.",虽然你可以得知一个人对生活是否满意， 但却无法告诉你 他们平常活的有多快乐， 而反之亦然。
"Just to give you a sense of the correlation,  the correlation is about .5.",只是为了让你对其中的关联性有个基本概念， 它们之间大概只有50%关联。
"What that means is if you met somebody,  and you were told, ""Oh his father is six feet tall,""  how much would you know about his height?",意思是当你见到某个人时， 你被告知他的爸爸有六尺高， 你能知道这个人有多高么？
"Well, you would know something about his height,  but there's a lot of uncertainty.",好吧，你可能有个基本概念， 但非常不确定。
You have that much uncertainty.,你无法下判定。
"If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,  you have a lot of uncertainty  about how happy they are  with their experiencing self.",若我说有人给自己的生活质量打分，他打8/10分， 你也不能把握 他们的经验自我 有多么快乐。
So the correlation is low.,所以关联性很低。
We know something about what controls  satisfaction of the happiness self.,我们知道什么能够 让人的快乐得到满足。
"We know that money is very important,  goals are very important.",我们知道钱是很重要的， 目标也非常重要。
"We know that happiness is mainly  being satisfied with people that we like,  spending time with people that we like.",我们知道要快乐是需要通过 我们所喜爱的人来满足， 是需要花时间和他们待在一起来满足。
"There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.",虽然还有其它因素，但这是主要因素。
"So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,  you are going to end up  doing very different things.",所以假若你想让两个自我都快乐， 你必须抛弃旧习 且要做些与众不同的事。
The bottom line of what I've said here  is that we really should not think of happiness  as a substitute for well-being.,我说的是，我们至少 不应把快乐当成活得好的 代名词。
It is a completely different notion.,这两者是天壤之别的。
"Now, very quickly,  another reason we cannot think straight about happiness  is that we do not attend to the same things  when we think about life, and we actually live.",现在，很快地讨论下 另一个我们不能理解快乐本质的原因， 那就是我们怎么看生活 和我们怎么过生活是不一样的。
"So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,  you are not going to get to the correct answer.",所以，当你问加州的人有多快乐时， 你将无法得到正确答案。
"When you ask that question,  you think people must be happier in California  if, say, you live in Ohio.",因为当你这样问时， 你认为加州人一定过得比较快乐， 而你则住在俄亥俄州。
"And what happens is  when you think about living in California,  you are thinking of the contrast  between California and other places,  and that contrast, say, is in climate.",当你在想 住在加州有多快乐时， 你会想到加州和其他州域 之间的差异性， 譬如，气候。
"Well, it turns out that climate  is not very important to the experiencing self  and it's not even very important to the reflective self  that decides how happy people are.",事实证明气候条件 对于经验自我并非很重要 而且对于思考自我 衡量自己有多快乐也不太重要。
"But now, because the reflective self is in charge,  you may end up -- some people may end up  moving to California.",不过，既然现实由思考自我主导， 一些人可能会得到这样一种结论， 那就是搬到加州。
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen  to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.,他们搬去加州是为了过上更快乐的生活， 是而追踪观看他们的后续发展，将会是一件相当有趣的事。
"Well, their experiencing self  is not going to get happier.",他们的经验自我 是不会变得更快乐。
We know that.,这我们都知道。
"But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,  because, when they think about it,  they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,  and they will feel they made the right decision.",不过当一件事发生后，他们会觉得自己快乐多了。 因为在他们思考时， 他们会回想起俄亥俄州的坏天气。 他们也因此觉得他们做出了正确的决定。
"to think straight about well-being,  and I hope I have given you a sense  of how difficult it is.",要理解快乐生活 实在很难， 我希望我已经让你们对此有个基本概念， 并且明白这个过程到底有多难。
Thank you.,谢谢。
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.,克里斯·安德森：谢谢您的演讲。我有个问题想请教您。
Thank you so much.,非常感谢您的演说。
"Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,  you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result  came out of that Gallup survey.",几星期前，我们有过一次电话通讯， 当时您提到您从盖洛普的调查中 发现了一个有趣的现象。
Is that something you can share  since you do have a few moments left now?,请问您可以跟我们分享一下吗？ 我们还有几分钟的时间。
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.,丹尼尔·卡纳曼：没问题。
"I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey  is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.",我从盖洛普调查中发现了一个极有趣的数字， 能发现它实属意外。
We found that with respect to the happiness  of the experiencing self.,我们发现一个关于 经验自我的快乐的现象。
"When we looked at how feelings,  vary with income.",那就是人的感觉 会随收入的多少而变化。
"And it turns out that, below an income  of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --  and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,  so it's a large representative sample --  below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...",结果表明，对于年收入低于六万美元的 美国人而言， 这占了样本中的很大一部分， 将近有六十万人，这些人是相当具有指标性的， 这些年收入低于六十万美元......
"CA: 60,000.",安德森：是六万美元。
"DK: 60,000.",卡纳曼：六万美元。
"60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,  and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.",年收入六万美元的人是不快乐的， 而且收入越低，他们则逾不快乐。
"Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.",而当收入逾六万时，我们则得到一条标准水平线。
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.,难得看到这么平坦的线。
"Clearly, what is happening is  money does not buy you experiential happiness,  but lack of money certainly buys you misery,  and we can measure that misery  very, very clearly.",显然 金钱是无法买到经验自我的快乐， 但没钱却的确能给你带来悲郁的境况， 而且我们清楚地测到痛苦的程度， 非常清楚。
"In terms of the other self, the remembering self,  you get a different story.",对于另一个自我，记忆自我而言。 你则有了一个大相迳庭的故事。
"The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.",你赚的越多，你就越满意。
That does not hold for emotions.,这跟情感没有任何关联。
"CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about  life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.",安德森：可是丹尼，生命、自由和追求快乐 是所有美国人奋斗的目标。
"If people took seriously that finding,  I mean, it seems to turn upside down  everything we believe about, like for example,  taxation policy and so forth.",假若大家都认真对待这一发现， 那么，这将颠覆我们 固有的观念，例如， 课税政策等。
"Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,  would take a finding like that seriously  and run public policy based on it?",这个国家的政治人物有没有可能 会正视这样的发现 并且依次施政？
DK: You know I think that there is recognition  of the role of happiness research in public policy.,卡纳曼：我认为已有人认知到研究快乐 于谋划政策中的地位。
"The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,  no question about that,  but in the U.K., it is happening,  and in other countries it is happening.",但这项认知于美国的传播速度颇慢， 这是毋庸置疑的， 但在英国，它正持续发酵， 其他国家亦然。
People are recognizing that they ought  to be thinking of happiness  when they think of public policy.,一般人也开始认知到 在谋划政策时 亦应将快乐纳入考量指标。
"It's going to take a while,  and people are going to debate  whether they want to study experience happiness,  or whether they want to study life evaluation,  so we need to have that debate fairly soon.",虽然这将花些时间， 但人们也将开始思考。 他们要的是经验的快乐 抑或是为生活打分， 因此很快，我们将要理解这个问题。
"How to enhance happiness  goes very different ways depending on how you think,  and whether you think of the remembering self  or you think of the experiencing self.",如何增进快乐， 有好几种方式，但事关你是怎么想的， 你想的是记忆自我 还是在想经验自我。
"This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.",我想于几年之内，这将影响政策的实施。
"In the United States, efforts are being made  to measure the experience happiness of the population.",美国已经付出巨大的努力来衡量 大众的经验的快乐。
"This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,  part of national statistics.",我想在十年或二十年内， 这将会成为国家统计数据的一部分。
"CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --  the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years.",安德森：这个议题对于我来说 将会是未来几年里 最有的一个政策讨论议题。
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.,非常感谢您所创造的行为经济学。
"Thank you, Danny Kahneman.",非常感谢丹尼尔·卡纳曼。
I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.,我今天要谈的是能源与气候，这可能有点出人意料
"And that might seem a bit surprising because  my full-time work at the Foundation is mostly about vaccines and seeds,  about the things that we need to invent and deliver  to help the poorest two billion live better lives.",我今天要谈的是能源与气候，这可能有点出人意料 毕竟我在基金会的全职工作主要是关于疾病疫苗和农业种苗的 那些的确是需要我们发明传播，以改善世上最贫穷的二十亿人的生活的东西 那些的确是需要我们发明传播，以改善世上最贫穷的二十亿人的生活的东西
"But energy and climate are extremely important to these people --  in fact, more important than to anyone else on the planet.",但事实上，能源和气候对这些人极为重要，事实上，比对地球上其他人更加重要 但事实上，能源和气候对这些人极为重要，事实上，比对地球上其他人更加重要
"The climate getting worse means that many years, their crops won't grow:  There will be too much rain, not enough rain,  things will change in ways  that their fragile environment simply can't support.",气候的持续恶化意味着他们的庄稼将多年无法生长，意味着洪涝或干旱 气候的持续恶化意味着他们的庄稼将多年无法生长，意味着洪涝或干旱 这些变化将令他们脆弱的环境无法承受 这些变化将令他们脆弱的环境无法承受
"And that leads to starvation, it leads to uncertainty, it leads to unrest.",这将导致饥荒，导致动荡，导致社会骚乱
"So, the climate changes will be terrible for them.",所以，气候变化将给他们带来严重后果，同时，能源价格也对他们至关重要
"Also, the price of energy is very important to them.",所以，气候变化将给他们带来严重后果，同时，能源价格也对他们至关重要
"In fact, if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of,  to reduce poverty, by far you would pick energy.",事实上，如果只能降低一样东西的价格以减少贫困，你一定会首选能源价格 事实上，如果只能降低一样东西的价格以减少贫困，你一定会首选能源价格
"Now, the price of energy has come down over time.",能源价格随着人类历史进程逐渐下降，先进文明是建立在先进能源的基础上的
Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.,能源价格随着人类历史进程逐渐下降，先进文明是建立在先进能源的基础上的
"The coal revolution fueled the Industrial Revolution,  and, even in the 1900s we've seen a very rapid decline in the price of electricity,  and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning,  we can make modern materials and do so many things.","当年的煤炭革命推进了工业革命 早在二十世纪初,我们就迎来了电价的快速下跌,这就是我们能够享受冰箱空调的原因 早在二十世纪初,我们就迎来了电价的快速下跌,这就是我们能够享受冰箱空调的原因 我们由此可以拥有各种现代化的事物，能够做各种事情"
"And so, we're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world.",得益于电力，我们能在一个富裕的世界里过着美妙的生活
"But, as we make it cheaper -- and let's go for making it twice as cheap --  we need to meet a new constraint,  and that constraint has to do with CO2.",但是，当我们进一步降低电价的时候，比如再使其便宜两倍 我们就有了一个新的限制，这个限制与二氧化碳有关 我们就有了一个新的限制，这个限制与二氧化碳有关
"CO2 is warming the planet,  and the equation on CO2 is actually a very straightforward one.",二氧化碳正在使全球变暖，而计算二氧化碳排放的公式其实非常简单明了 二氧化碳正在使全球变暖，而计算二氧化碳排放的公式其实非常简单明了
"If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,  that leads to a temperature increase,  and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:  the effects on the weather; perhaps worse, the indirect effects,  in that the natural ecosystems can't adjust to these rapid changes,  and so you get ecosystem collapses.",当前二氧化碳巨大的排放量将导致温度上升 当前二氧化碳巨大的排放量将导致温度上升 温度的升高将引起一系列非常严重的后果 比如对天气的直接影响，或对生态系统的间接影响，生态系统无法应对剧烈变化的结果就是生态系统的全面崩溃 比如对天气的直接影响，或对生态系统的间接影响，生态系统无法应对剧烈变化的结果就是生态系统的全面崩溃 比如对天气的直接影响，或对生态系统的间接影响，生态系统无法应对剧烈变化的结果就是生态系统的全面崩溃
"Now, the exact amount of how you map  from a certain increase of CO2 to what temperature will be  and where the positive feedbacks are,  there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.",二氧化碳排放增加和温度升高究竟成怎样的关系，两者间的正反馈效应为何？ 二氧化碳排放增加和温度升高究竟成怎样的关系，两者间的正反馈效应为何？ 二氧化碳排放增加和温度升高究竟成怎样的关系，两者间的正反馈效应为何？ 这中间有一些不确定因素，但不多
"And there's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be,  but they will be extremely bad.",至于全球变暖的具体负面影响有多严重，这无法完全确定，但肯定极其严重 至于全球变暖的具体负面影响有多严重，这无法完全确定，但肯定极其严重
I asked the top scientists on this several times:  Do we really have to get down to near zero?,我为此多次请教过顶尖的科学家们：我们真的一定要将二氧化碳排放降到零吗？ 我为此多次请教过顶尖的科学家们：我们真的一定要将二氧化碳排放降到零吗？
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?,减少到一半或四分之一不行吗？
"And the answer is that until we get near to zero,  the temperature will continue to rise.",他们的回答是，除非我们降到零，否则气温将持续上升，那将是一个巨大的挑战 他们的回答是，除非我们降到零，否则气温将持续上升，那将是一个巨大的挑战
And so that's a big challenge.,他们的回答是，除非我们降到零，否则气温将持续上升，那将是一个巨大的挑战
"It's very different than saying ""We're a twelve-foot-high truck trying to get under a ten-foot bridge,  and we can just sort of squeeze under.""",这不同于让一辆12英尺高的卡车通过限高10英尺的桥，只要想办法挤过去即可 这不同于让一辆12英尺高的卡车通过限高10英尺的桥，只要想办法挤过去即可
This is something that has to get to zero.,二氧化碳的排放是要彻底降到零为止
"Now, we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year,  over 26 billion tons.",当前我们每年都排放大量的二氧化碳，总量超过260亿吨 当前我们每年都排放大量的二氧化碳，总量超过260亿吨
"For each American, it's about 20 tons;  for people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.",美国人约排放量约20吨，贫穷国家人均不到一吨，全球人均排放量约为5吨 美国人约排放量约20吨，贫穷国家人均不到一吨，全球人均排放量约为5吨
It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.,美国人约排放量约20吨，贫穷国家人均不到一吨，全球人均排放量约为5吨
"And, somehow, we have to make changes  that will bring that down to zero.",无论如何，我们都要做出改变，直至把这个数字降到零 无论如何，我们都要做出改变，直至把这个数字降到零
It's been constantly going up.,这个数字现在还在继续上升中，只有经济波动才稍稍抑制其上升的势头
"It's only various economic changes that have even flattened it at all,  so we have to go from rapidly rising  to falling, and falling all the way to zero.",这个数字现在还在继续上升中，只有经济波动才稍稍抑制其上升的势头 我们不但要扭转其迅速上升的势头，还要让它下降，并且一路降到零 我们不但要扭转其迅速上升的势头，还要让它下降，并且一路降到零
"This equation has four factors,  a little bit of multiplication:  So, you've got a thing on the left, CO2, that you want to get to zero,  and that's going to be based on the number of people,  the services each person's using on average,  the energy on average for each service,  and the CO2 being put out per unit of energy.",这个二氧化碳的公式有四个因素，四者相乘 这个二氧化碳的公式有四个因素，四者相乘 等式左面是二氧化碳排放量，我们的目标是让它降到零 二氧化碳排放＝人口总数 X 人均使用的服务量 X 每单位服务平均耗用能源量 X 每单位能源的二氧化碳排放 二氧化碳排放＝人口总数 X 人均使用的服务量 X 每单位服务平均耗用能源量 X 每单位能源的二氧化碳排放 二氧化碳排放＝人口总数 X 人均使用的服务量 X 每单位服务平均耗用能源量 X 每单位能源的二氧化碳排放 二氧化碳排放＝人口总数 X 人均使用的服务量 X 每单位服务平均耗用能源量 X 每单位能源的二氧化碳排放
"So, let's look at each one of these  and see how we can get this down to zero.",下面让我们逐个来看各个因子，看看怎样才能将等式最终降为零 下面让我们逐个来看各个因子，看看怎样才能将等式最终降为零
"Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.",显然，我们需要至少一个因子非常接近于零，这是简单的高中代数
"Now that's back from high school algebra,  but let's take a look.",显然，我们需要至少一个因子非常接近于零，这是简单的高中代数 ♫ 我们来看一下，首先是人口

The world today has 6.8 billion people.,目前世界上有68亿人，这将继续增长到约90亿人
That's headed up to about nine billion.,目前世界上有68亿人，这将继续增长到约90亿人
"Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,  health care, reproductive health services,  we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15 percent,  but there we see an increase of about 1.3.",如果我们在新疫苗开发、医疗服务、生殖健康方面的工作做得卓有成效的话 如果我们在新疫苗开发、医疗服务、生殖健康方面的工作做得卓有成效的话 这个数字可能可以减少10％到15％，这样的话综合增长率约为1.3 这个数字可能可以减少10％到15％，这样的话综合增长率约为1.3
The second factor is the services we use.,第二个因子是我们使用的服务
"This encompasses everything:  the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.",这包括所有东西：我们吃的食物，穿的衣服，电视，暖气，都是些非常美好的事物 这包括所有东西：我们吃的食物，穿的衣服，电视，暖气，都是些非常美好的事物
These are very good things:  getting rid of poverty means providing these services  to almost everyone on the planet.,这包括所有东西：我们吃的食物，穿的衣服，电视，暖气，都是些非常美好的事物 摆脱贫穷就意味着向地球上每个人提供这些服务，这个因子进一步提高才是好事 摆脱贫穷就意味着向地球上每个人提供这些服务，这个因子进一步提高才是好事
And it's a great thing for this number to go up.,摆脱贫穷就意味着向地球上每个人提供这些服务，这个因子进一步提高才是好事
"In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,  we probably could cut back and use less,  but every year, this number, on average, is going to go up,  and so, over all, that will more than double  the services delivered per person.",在发达国家里，最富裕的十亿人，或许可以控制消费，减少一些服务享受 在发达国家里，最富裕的十亿人，或许可以控制消费，减少一些服务享受 但总体而言，这个数字将会逐年上升，最终人均享受的服务，将翻一番还不止 但总体而言，这个数字将会逐年上升，最终人均享受的服务，将翻一番还不止 但总体而言，这个数字将会逐年上升，最终人均享受的服务，将翻一番还不止
Here we have a very basic service:  Do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework?,在这一地区，我们享有的服务非常基础：你家里有没有写作业的照明灯光？ 在这一地区，我们享有的服务非常基础：你家里有没有写作业的照明灯光？
"And, in fact, these kids don't, so they're going out  and reading their school work under the street lamps.",这些孩子就没有，所以他们要到外面去，坐在路灯下面写作业 这些孩子就没有，所以他们要到外面去，坐在路灯下面写作业
"Now, efficiency, E, the energy for each service,  here finally we have some good news.",下面一个因素是效率，也就是每项服务所消耗的能源 在这一项上我们总算有了些好消息：这一因子不会持续上升
We have something that's not going up.,在这一项上我们总算有了些好消息：这一因子不会持续上升
"Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,  through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings --  there are a lot of services where you can bring  the energy for that service down quite substantially.",通过各种发明和新的照明方法，通过新技术的汽车，新的建筑方式 通过各种发明和新的照明方法，通过新技术的汽车，新的建筑方式 我们可以将很多服务所消耗的能源大大降低，个别服务，甚至可以降低百分之九十 我们可以将很多服务所消耗的能源大大降低，个别服务，甚至可以降低百分之九十
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.,我们可以将很多服务所消耗的能源大大降低，个别服务，甚至可以降低百分之九十
"There are other services like how we make fertilizer,  or how we do air transport,  where the rooms for improvement are far, far less.",但另外一些服务，比如化肥生产，航空运输等，可以提升的空间较为有限 但另外一些服务，比如化肥生产，航空运输等，可以提升的空间较为有限 但另外一些服务，比如化肥生产，航空运输等，可以提升的空间较为有限
"And so, overall here, if we're optimistic,  we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even, perhaps, a factor of six.",所以，综合来看，对这一项的乐观估计为：我们可能能实现三到六倍的下降 所以，综合来看，对这一项的乐观估计为：我们可能能实现三到六倍的下降
"But for these first three factors now,  we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,  and that just won't cut it.",就已讨论三个因素来说，我们最多将排放量从260吨降到130亿吨，这还远远不够 就已讨论三个因素来说，我们最多将排放量从260吨降到130亿吨，这还远远不够 就已讨论三个因素来说，我们最多将排放量从260吨降到130亿吨，这还远远不够
So let's look at this fourth factor --  this is going to be a key one --  and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.,最后，我们来看第四个因素，也是最关键的一个 最后，我们来看第四个因素，也是最关键的一个 也就是每单位能源所排放的二氧化碳
And so the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?,我们的问题是，这一因素真的能降到零吗？
"If you burn coal, no.",烧煤肯定不行，烧气也不行
"If you burn natural gas, no.",烧煤肯定不行，烧气也不行
"Almost every way we make electricity today,  except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.",我们现有的所有发电方式都会产生二氧化碳，除了发展中的的可再生能源与核能 我们现有的所有发电方式都会产生二氧化碳，除了发展中的的可再生能源与核能
"And so, what we're going to have to do at a global scale,  is create a new system.",所以，我们需要在全球范围内建立一个新系统，我们需要能源奇迹 所以，我们需要在全球范围内建立一个新系统，我们需要能源奇迹
"And so, we need energy miracles.",所以，我们需要在全球范围内建立一个新系统，我们需要能源奇迹
"Now, when I use the term ""miracle,"" I don't mean something that's impossible.",虽然我用了“奇迹”一词，但这并不是说这件事是不可能的
The microprocessor is a miracle. The personal computer is a miracle.,微处理器是奇迹，个人电脑是奇迹，互联网及其应用也是奇迹
The Internet and its services are a miracle.,微处理器是奇迹，个人电脑是奇迹，互联网及其应用也是奇迹
"So, the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles.",也就是说，在座的各位已经目睹甚至参与了很多奇迹的发生
"Usually, we don't have a deadline,  where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.",一般来说，我们不会对奇迹的发生设置最后期限 一般来说，我们不会对奇迹的发生设置最后期限
"Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.",通常，你只是袖手旁观，有些奇迹就发生了，有些则没有
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed  and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline.,但在低碳减排这件事上，我们必须全力以赴去推动，从而在最终期限前实现这一奇迹 但在低碳减排这件事上，我们必须全力以赴去推动，从而在最终期限前实现这一奇迹
"Now, I thought, ""How could I really capture this?",我想，我怎样才能更好地呈现这一问题呢？有没有一种自然生动的表达？
"Is there some kind of natural illustration,  some demonstration that would grab people's imagination here?""",我想，我怎样才能更好地呈现这一问题呢？有没有一种自然生动的表达？ 有没有某种演示能激发人们的想象力？
"I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitos,  and somehow people enjoyed that.",我回想起一年前我带了些蚊子到这里来，大家好像还蛮喜欢的 我回想起一年前我带了些蚊子到这里来，大家好像还蛮喜欢的
"It really got them involved in the idea of,  you know, there are people who live with mosquitos.",蚊子让那次的与会者真正地意识到：世界上有些人是与蚊子一起生活的 蚊子让那次的与会者真正地意识到：世界上有些人是与蚊子一起生活的
"So, with energy, all I could come up with is this.",所以，今天既然在谈能源，我想到带来这个：萤火虫
I decided that releasing fireflies  would be my contribution to the environment here this year.,我决定，放飞萤火虫将是我今年对这里环境做出的贡献 我决定，放飞萤火虫将是我今年对这里环境做出的贡献
So here we have some natural fireflies.,这是几只天然的萤火虫，据说不咬人，说不定它们都懒得出那个罐子 这是几只天然的萤火虫，据说不咬人，说不定它们都懒得出那个罐子
"I'm told they don't bite; in fact, they might not even leave that jar.",这是几只天然的萤火虫，据说不咬人，说不定它们都懒得出那个罐子 像萤火虫这样的解决能源问题有奇思妙想有很多，但实际作用相当有限
"Now, there's all sorts of gimmicky solutions like that one,  but they don't really add up to much.",我们需要的是解决方案，一个或很多个都行，极具规模性和可靠性的解决方案 我们需要的是解决方案，一个或很多个都行，极具规模性和可靠性的解决方案

"I've left out tide, geothermal, fusion, biofuels.",我没有包括潮汐、地热、聚变和生物燃料等，那些都将有所贡献
"Those may make some contribution,  and if they can do better than I expect, so much the better,  but my key point here  is that we're going to have to work on each of these five,  and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,  because they all have significant challenges.",我没有包括潮汐、地热、聚变和生物燃料等，那些都将有所贡献 如果它们的表现能超过我的预期，当然更好 但关键的是，我们在这五种方式上必须全部大力投入 但关键的是，我们在这五种方式上必须全部大力投入 不能因为他们看似艰巨而放弃，因为它们都包含着严峻的挑战 不能因为他们看似艰巨而放弃，因为它们都包含着严峻的挑战
"Let's look first at the burning fossil fuels,  either burning coal or burning natural gas.",首先来看一下化石燃料，烧煤或者烧气 首先来看一下化石燃料，烧煤或者烧气
"What you need to do there, seems like it might be simple, but it's not,  and that's to take all the CO2, after you've burned it, going out the flue,  pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere, and hope it stays there.","我们需要做的，说来简单，其实不然 需要采取的措施是把所有燃烧产生的二氧化碳，通过烟囱收集，然后加压、液化,储存 需要采取的措施是把所有燃烧产生的二氧化碳，通过烟囱收集，然后加压、液化、储存，并保证不泄漏 需要采取的措施是把所有燃烧产生的二氧化碳，通过烟囱收集，然后加压、液化、储存，并保证不泄漏"
"Now we have some pilot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level,  but getting up to that full percentage, that will be very tricky,  and agreeing on where these CO2 quantities should be put will be hard,  but the toughest one here is this long-term issue.",当前的试验已经能做到60％至80%的水平，但要做到百分之百会十分的困难 当前的试验已经能做到60％至80%的水平，但要做到百分之百会十分的困难 并且在哪里储存那么大量的二氧化碳也容易引起争议 最困难的是这是个长期问题
Who's going to be sure?,谁能保证它呢？
Who's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger  than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?,这些废料体积十亿倍于其它核废料等废品，谁能保证长期安全？ 这些废料体积十亿倍于其它核废料等废品，谁能保证长期安全？
This is a lot of volume.,这个二氧化碳的量非常大，所以会十分困难
So that's a tough one.,这个二氧化碳的量非常大，所以会十分困难
Next would be nuclear.,下一个，核能，同样有三个大问题
"It also has three big problems:  Cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;  the issue of the safety, really feeling good about nothing could go wrong,  that, even though you have these human operators,  that the fuel doesn't get used for weapons.",下一个，核能，同样有三个大问题 它的成本，尤其是在高度管控的国家，非常高 安全问题，保证一切有条不紊 即使有人工操作 即使核燃料不会被用作武器
And then what do you do with the waste?,还有核废弃物要怎么处理的问题
"And, although it's not very large, there are a lot of concerns about that.",虽然量并不大，但有很多令人顾虑的地方
People need to feel good about it.,好的解决方式必须让人们感到安心
"So three very tough problems that might be solvable,  and so, should be worked on.",这是三个困难但可能可以解决的问题 所以需要继续努力
"The last three of the five, I've grouped together.",五种能源的最后三个，我会放在一起来讲
These are what people often refer to as the renewable sources.,这是人们通常称为可再生能源的三种能源
And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --  they have some disadvantages.,事实上，它们虽然不需要燃料 但也有不足之处
One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies  is dramatically less than a power plant.,首先是这些技术所收集到的能源的密度，要远远小于电厂 首先是这些技术所收集到的能源的密度，要远远小于电厂
"This is energy farming, so you're talking about many square miles,  thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant.",这是能源农业，其规模都是平方公里级的 比常规的发电厂要大几千倍
"Also, these are intermittent sources.",还有，这些能源是间歇性的
"The sun doesn't shine all day, it doesn't shine every day,  and, likewise, the wind doesn't blow all the time.",太阳不是一整天都有，也不是每天都有 同样，风也不是一直在吹
"And so, if you depend on these sources,  you have to have some way of getting the energy  during those time periods that it's not available.",如果完全依赖这些来源 你还得有其它渠道来获取能源，以度过间歇期 你还得有其它渠道来获取能源，以度过间歇期
"So, we've got big cost challenges here,  we have transmission challenges:  for example, say this energy source is outside your country;  you not only need the technology,  but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from elsewhere.",因此，我们面临巨大的成本问题 还有传输方面的挑战 比如说，某个能源来源在国外 你不仅需要能源技术 还要应对能源不在国内的相关风险
"And, finally, this storage problem.",最后，是储存的问题
"And, to dimensionalize this, I went through and looked at  all the types of batteries that get made --  for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything --  and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses,  and what I found is that all the batteries we make now  could store less than 10 minutes of all the energy.",为了让这个问题具体化，我仔细研究了所有现有的电池 为了让这个问题具体化，我仔细研究了所有现有的电池 车用的，电脑用的，手机的，手电筒的，所有的东西上用的电池 把其存储电量与世界每日消耗电能比较 我发现我们现在制造的所有电池 只能储存不到10分钟的所有能源
"And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,  something that's going to be a factor of 100 better  than the approaches we have now.",所以，实际上，我们需要一个重大的突破 需要一个比现在的技术好一百倍的解决方案 需要一个比现在的技术好一百倍的解决方案
"It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.",这并不是不可能的，但也不会很容易
"Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source  to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.",这样，我们可以用间歇性能源 提供20%-30%所需的能量
"If you're counting on it for 100 percent,  you need an incredible miracle battery.",但如果你希望100%地依赖它 你需要一个非常高效的奇迹电池
"Now, how we're going to go forward on this -- what's the right approach?",那么，我们怎么进行下去呢？正确的方法在哪里？
Is it a Manhattan Project? What's the thing that can get us there?,这会是一个曼哈顿计划吗？我们怎么才能到达彼岸？

"And a lot of them, you'll look at and say, ""They're crazy."" That's good.",里面的很多人，你会觉得他们很疯狂，这就对了。
"And, I think, here in the TED group,  we have many people who are already pursuing this.",我认为，在TED团队里 已经有很多人开始致力于此
"Bill Gross has several companies, including one called eSolar  that has some great solar thermal technologies.",比尔格罗斯有好几家公司，其中一个叫eSolar，拥有非常棒的太阳能发热技术 比尔格罗斯有好几家公司，其中一个叫eSolar，拥有非常棒的太阳能发热技术
"Vinod Khosla's investing in dozens of companies  that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,  and I'm trying to help back that.",维诺德科斯拉投资了几十家公司 他们的工作非常棒，并提出很有趣的可能性 我也计划支持他们的项目
"Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company  that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.",其实纳珊米赫沃尔德和我已经在支持一家公司 也许有点让人吃惊，但这个公司是核能方向的
"There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.",在核能方面虽然近年有些小创新， 像模具化，液体使用等等
"And innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,  so the idea that there's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising.",但其实创新在这个行业已经停止有一段时间了 所以现在出现一些好点子不是什么太奇怪的事情
"The idea of TerraPower is that, instead of burning a part of uranium --  the one percent, which is the U235 --  we decided, ""Let's burn the 99 percent, the U238.""",Terrapower的想法是：不去烧常规的铀U235 Terrapower的想法是：不去烧常规的铀U235 而是烧剩下的99%，即U238
It is kind of a crazy idea.,这是个有些疯狂的想法，但其实，人们已经讨论了很长时间
"In fact, people had talked about it for a long time,  but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,  and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers  that now you can simulate and see that, yes,  with the right material's approach, this looks like it would work.",这是个有些疯狂的想法，但其实，人们已经讨论了很长时间 但一直无法很好地模拟出这是否可行 有了现代超级计算机的不断升级 我们现在能做这个模拟，而且可以预见， 只要用对材料，这方案是可行的
"And, because you're burning that 99 percent,  you have greatly improved cost profile.",而且，因为我们烧的是以前丢弃的99%核废料 成本可以极大地降低
"You actually burn up the waste, and you can actually use as fuel  all the leftover waste from today's reactors.",你实际上是把废料变作燃料 再也不用担心该怎样处理现有所有核反应堆的废料，这是个很好的消息
"So, instead of worrying about them, you just take that. It's a great thing.",再也不用担心该怎样处理现有所有核反应堆的废料，这是个很好的消息
"It breathes this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.","这种技术就像蜡烛一样,逐渐烧尽铀废料"
"You can see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.","过程就如这根柱子所示,通常被称为浪潮反应堆"
"In terms of fuel, this really solves the problem.",燃料的问题解决了
I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.,这是肯塔基州的一个废料场
"This is the leftover, the 99 percent,  where they've taken out the part they burn now,  so it's called depleted uranium.","这就是那些废料,那99% 这就是U235已耗尽的燃料 被称作耗尽的铀"
That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years.,这些可以为全美国供电数百年
"And, simply by filtering seawater in an inexpensive process,  you'd have enough fuel for the entire lifetime of the rest of the planet.",另外，仅仅是通过低成本的海水过滤程序 得到的燃料就足以供应地球下半辈子使用
"So, you know, it's got lots of challenges ahead,  but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas  that we need to move forward.","你看, 前面还会有很多挑战 但这只是数百种方法中的一个例子 需要我们继续推进"
So let's think: How should we measure ourselves?,想一想，我们要如何衡量我们的成就
What should our report card look like?,我们的成绩单应该打多少分？
"Well, let's go out to where we really need to get,  and then look at the intermediate.",先来看一下我们的最终目标，再倒推来看我们的中期目标 先来看一下我们的最终目标，再倒推来看我们的中期目标
"For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.",已经有很多人在谈到2050年前减碳80%
"That really is very important, that we get there.",这真的非常重要，我们必须完成这个目标
"And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries,  still some agriculture,  hopefully we will have cleaned up forestry, cement.",而剩下那20%应是贫穷国家的份额 比如一些农业国家 但愿，我们到时已经清理了伐木业和水泥业
"So, to get to that 80 percent,  the developed countries, including countries like China,  will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.",所以，要达到这80% 发达国家，以及中国这些国家 需要共同改变它们的发电方式
"So, the other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,  have we deployed it in all the developed countries  and we're in the process of getting it elsewhere?",另外一级是，我们是否部署了零排放技术 我们是否在所有发达国家里都采用了该项技术 并且在向其他地区推广的过程中
That's super important.,这点非常重要
That's a key element of making that report card.,这是交出优秀答卷的关键因素
"So, backing up from there, what should the 2020 report card look like?",从2050年往回推，我们2020年的成绩应该是怎样呢？
"Well, again, it should have the two elements.",嗯，一样会有两个部分
"We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:  The less we emit, the less that sum will be of CO2,  and, therefore, the less the temperature.",我们应该仔细审查那些衡量效率的标准以开始减少排放 我们排放的越少，二氧化碳总量就越少 温度也就越低
"But in some ways, the grade we get there,  doing things that don't get us all the way to the big reductions,  is only equally, or maybe even slightly less, important than the other,  which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs.","但从某个角度来说，我们在2020年取得的成绩 做一些有所减排但并非大量减排的事 仅仅等同于,或低轻于另一件事情的重要性 那就是带来关键突破的那些创新"
"These breakthroughs, we need to move those at full speed,  and we can measure that in terms of companies,  pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.","我们需要全速达成这些技术突破 我们可以用参与的公司的数目, 试验项目，或是调控政策的变化 来衡量"
There's a lot of great books that have been written about this.,关于这个话题有许多很好的书
"The Al Gore book, ""Our Choice""  and the David McKay book, ""Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air.""",比如，戈尔的《我们的选择》 大卫麦基的《不再炽热的可持续能源》
"They really go through it and create a framework  that this can be discussed broadly,  because we need broad backing for this.","他们用心研究, 并且构建了一个框架 便于对该问题的广泛讨论 因为我们需要对这一问题的广泛支持"
There's a lot that has to come together.,需要多方大力协作
So this is a wish.,这是一个愿望
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.,我们发明这项技术是个非常具体非常现实的愿望
"If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years --  I could pick who's president,  I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,  or I could pick that this thing  that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented --  this is the wish I would pick.",如果我能为下个50年许一个愿望 我可以选择谁来当总统 或者选择一个疫苗，那是我热爱的事业 或者选择能源这件事 发明出能将能源价格减半并且零排放的技术 我肯定会选择能源
This is the one with the greatest impact.,这将是影响最大的一个
"If we don't get this wish,  the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible,  between the U.S. and China, between poor countries and rich,  and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse.","如果我们没法实现这个愿望 考虑短期目标和长期目标的人们之间会有巨大分歧 美国与中国，穷国和富国之间, 会有巨大分歧 而二十亿人最穷的人中大多数的生活会极大恶化"
"So, what do we have to do?",那么我们必须做什么？
What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?,我恳求你们参与推动的到底是什么？
We need to go for more research funding.,我们应该增加研究资助
"When countries get together in places like Copenhagen,  they shouldn't just discuss the CO2.",在像哥本哈根这样的会议上 各国不应该只讨论二氧化碳减排日程表
"They should discuss this innovation agenda,  and you'd be stunned at the ridiculously low levels of spending  on these innovative approaches.",也应该讨论创新的日程表 对这些创新方法的投入之低 绝对会让你震惊
"We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade --  something that gets that price signal out there.",我们确实需要一些市场激励，二氧化碳税费，限额和交易 用这些东西来发出价格信号
We need to get the message out.,我们需要把信息传出去
"We need to have this dialogue be a more rational, more understandable dialogue,  including the steps that the government takes.",我们应该让这一对话更加理性，更加易于理解 包括政府所采取的措施
"This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.",这是一个重要的愿望，并且我觉得这是一个可以实现的愿望
Thank you.,谢谢
Thank you.,谢谢 谢谢
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Thank you.,主持人：谢谢
"Thank you. So to understand more about TerraPower, right --  I mean, first of all, can you give a sense of what scale of investment this is?",谢谢 谢谢，我对Terrapower更了解了 首先，你能大概说下这个投资会是多大规模吗？
"Bil Gates: To actually do the software, buy the supercomputer,  hire all the great scientists, which we've done,  that's only tens of millions,  and even once we test our materials out in a Russian reactor  to make sure that our materials work properly,  then you'll only be up in the hundreds of millions.","比尔盖茨：如果只是买超级计算机, 做出软件 雇佣优秀的科学家，这些我们已经做到了 大概只用几千万 我们甚至去一个俄罗斯的反应堆测试了我们的材料 看看它是否能够正常工作 加起来也不过花费几个亿"
"The tough thing is building the pilot reactor;  finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location  that will actually build the first one of these.",最难的是建造试验反应堆 筹措几十亿，找到管理者，选定地点 这样才能建起第一座这样的核电站
"Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,  then it's just clear as day, because the economics, the energy density,  are so different than nuclear as we know it.",当你建起第一座后，如果它确实像说的那样有用， 那一切就都简单了，因为它的经济性、能源密度 与我们所熟悉的核能完全不同
"CA: And so, to understand it right, this involves building deep into the ground  almost like a vertical kind of column of nuclear fuel,  of this sort of spent uranium,  and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?",主持人：那么，是不是说，这需要往地下建造 一个用这种废弃铀建成的垂直核燃料柱 一个用这种废弃铀建成的垂直核燃料柱 然后反应从上往下渐进？
"BG: That's right. Today, you're always refueling the reactor,  so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong:  that thing where you're opening it up and moving things in and out, that's not good.","盖茨：没错。现在的核反应堆, 你得不停的重新加燃料 所以有很多人为因素和控制可能出错 你需要打开反应堆, 把核燃料搬进搬出，这些都可能出错，一点儿不保险 你需要打开反应堆, 把核燃料搬进搬出，这些都可能出错，一点儿不保险"
"So, if you have very cheap fuel that you can put 60 years in --  just think of it as a log --  put it down and not have those same complexities.",所以，如果有非常便宜的燃料，一根木柱的大小，就够使用60年 所以，如果有非常便宜的燃料，一根木柱的大小，就够使用60年 把它放下，没有那些复杂的后果
"And it just sits there and burns for the 60 years, and then it's done.",放那儿烧个六十年，然后没了
CA: It's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution.,主持人：那样的核电站本身就是自身废弃物的处理站
"BG: Yeah. Well, what happens with the waste,  you can let it sit there -- there's a lot less waste under this approach --  then you can actually take that,  and put it into another one and burn that.",盖茨：没错。这个过程产生的垃圾 你可以放在那儿，用这种办法只产生很少的废料 你也可以把它放到另外一个核电站里烧掉 你也可以把它放到另外一个核电站里烧掉
"And we start off actually by taking the waste that exists today,  that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry casking by reactors --  that's our fuel to begin with.",我们可以从处理现有核电站产生的垃圾开始 那些现在在冷却池或者反应堆旁的干罐里的废物 这是我们开始时的燃料
"So, the thing that's been a problem from those reactors  is actually what gets fed into ours,  and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically  as you're going through this process.",这样，当前那些反应堆自身的麻烦，却成为我们的原料，同时还大大减少了废物 这样，当前那些反应堆自身的麻烦，却成为我们的原料，同时还大大减少了废物 这样，当前那些反应堆自身的麻烦，却成为我们的原料，同时还大大减少了废物 这样，当前那些反应堆自身的麻烦，却成为我们的原料，同时还大大减少了废物
"CA: I mean, you're talking to different people around the world  about the possibilities here.",主持人：你和其他地方的人的谈话中 谈到这些可能性的时候
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this?,哪些人对实施这件事兴趣最大？
"BG: Well, we haven't picked a particular place,  and there's all these interesting disclosure rules about anything that's called ""nuclear,""  so we've got a lot of interest,  that people from the company have been in Russia, India, China --  I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,  talking about how this fits into the energy agenda.",盖茨：我们还没有选定一个特定的地方 由于到处都有关于核问题的保密规定 很多人表示了兴趣 俄罗斯，印度，中国的公司都表现了浓厚的兴趣 我也曾经在这里找过能源部长 谈论如何将这件事融入能源日程表
"So I'm optimistic. You know, the French and Japanese have done some work.",总地来说我很乐观，同时，法国和日本已经做了一些工作
This is a variant on something that has been done.,这是已有成就的一个变体
"It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,  and a lot of countries have built them,  so anybody who's done a fast reactor is a candidate to be where the first one gets built.",这是一个重要的进步，但像一个快速反应堆 很多国家已经修建了这样的反应堆 只要你已经有了快速反应堆，就可能成为第一个核垃圾重利用站的建设者
"CA: So, in your mind, timescale and likelihood  of actually taking something like this live?",主持人：就你看来，实现这一计划的时间跨度和可能性如何？ 主持人：就你看来，实现这一计划的时间跨度和可能性如何？
"BG: Well, we need -- for one of these high-scale, electro-generation things  that's very cheap,  we have 20 years to invent and then 20 years to deploy.",盖茨：建一个这种大规模的电站，并且成本要非常低 盖茨：建一个这种大规模的电站，并且成本要非常低 我们有20年时间来发明，再有20年时间来执行
That's sort of the deadline that the environmental models  have shown us that we have to meet.,这大致也是我们的环境模型所计算出的最终期限 这大致也是我们的环境模型所计算出的最终期限
"And, you know, TerraPower, if things go well -- which is wishing for a lot --  could easily meet that.",如果Terrapower一切顺利的话，当然那样会很不容易，可以很容易地满足这一要求 如果Terrapower一切顺利的话，当然那样会很不容易，可以很容易地满足这一要求
"And there are, fortunately now, dozens of companies --  we need it to be hundreds --  who, likewise, if their science goes well,  if the funding for their pilot plants goes well,  that they can compete for this.",目前还有数十家公司在从事这一事业 我们需要几百家 如果它们科研进展顺利 如果他们的试验电站的筹资顺利 他们都可以竞争这项任务
"And it's best if multiple succeed,  because then you could use a mix of these things.",如果能够多方成功那是最好 因为这样就可以同时利用多种方式
We certainly need one to succeed.,但我们至少需要一种能够成功

BG: An energy breakthrough is the most important thing.,盖茨：能源的突破是最重要的事
"It would have been, even without the environmental constraint,  but the environmental constraint just makes it so much greater.",即使没有环境的限制，它还会是最重要的问题 环境的限制使它变得更为突出，更为紧迫
"In the nuclear space, there are other innovators.",在核领域，还有其它的创新者
"You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,  but the modular people, that's a different approach.","但我对他们的工作,我们没有像对这个项目一样清楚 有些人在模块方面的创新,是另外一种方式"
"There's a liquid-type reactor, which seems a little hard,  but maybe they say that about us.",还有一种液态反应堆，实现起来有点困难 但也许他们看我们的方式也觉得困难
"And so, there are different ones,  but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium  has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal,  and so -- if you can deal with the negatives,  which are essentially the radiation --  the footprint and cost, the potential,  in terms of effect on land and various things,  is almost in a class of its own.","所以，有很多不同的办法 但核能的美妙之处在于, 一个铀分子所含的能量是其它能源的一百万倍 但核能的美妙之处在于, 一个铀分子所含的能量是其它能源的一百万倍 如果能够处理好负面因素，主要是辐射 如果能够处理好负面因素，主要是辐射 其碳排放、成本以及潜能潜能，就其各种因素而言，将是无与伦比的 其碳排放、成本以及潜能潜能，就其各种因素而言，将是无与伦比的 其碳排放、成本以及潜能潜能，就其各种因素而言，将是无与伦比的"
"CA: If this doesn't work, then what?",主持人；如果我们没能成功怎么办？
Do we have to start taking emergency measures  to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?,我们得采取什么紧急措施 来保证地球温度的稳定？
"BG: If you get into that situation,  it's like if you've been over-eating, and you're about to have a heart attack:  Then where do you go? You may need heart surgery or something.",盖茨：如果事情发展到那一步 就像吃的太多，可能会得心脏病一样 怎么办？你可能需要心脏手术之类的
"There is a line of research on what's called geoengineering,  which are various techniques that would delay the heating  to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together.",有一种研究叫做地球工程学 通过各种技术来延缓全球变暖 可以为我们争取20-30年的时间来共同行动
"Now, that's just an insurance policy.","不过,那就像是一个保险政策"
You hope you don't need to do that.,你希望你不会用到
"Some people say you shouldn't even work on the insurance policy  because it might make you lazy,  that you'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you.",有些人说根本不应该研究保险措施 因为这会使人懈怠 你会持续进食，反正你知道心脏手术可以挽救你
"I'm not sure that's wise, given the importance of the problem,  but there's now the geoengineering discussion  about -- should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,  or this innovation goes a lot slower than we expect?","考虑到问题的重要性，我不知道这样是否明智 现在关于地球工程的讨论 应该作为一个后备选择, 以防形势恶化得更快 或者技术创新迟于我们的预期"
"CA: Climate skeptics: If you had a sentence or two to say to them,  how might you persuade them that they're wrong?","主持人：对气候变化论的怀疑者, 如果让你对他们说一两句话 你会怎么说服他们？"

"The main problem we have here, it's kind of like AIDS.",这里的主要问题就像艾滋病
"You make the mistake now, and you pay for it a lot later.",现在犯错，将来得加倍的承受痛苦
"And so, when you have all sorts of urgent problems,  the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later,  and a somewhat uncertain pain thing --  in fact, the IPCC report, that's not necessarily the worst case,  and there are people in the rich world who look at IPCC  and say, ""OK, that isn't that big of a deal.""",因此，当你遇到各种紧要问题时 现在承受痛苦关系到将来的收益 而且还是个不确定的痛苦 实际上，IPCC报告，那还不是最坏的情况 而且，发达国家也有人看了报告后，说这没什么大不了的 而且，发达国家也有人看了报告后，说这没什么大不了的
The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this.,"事实上, 不确定的方面应该促进我们向这方面努力"
"But my dream here is that, if you can make it economic,  and meet the CO2 constraints,  then the skeptics say, ""OK,  I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2,  I kind of wish it did put out CO2,  but I guess I'll accept it because it's cheaper than what's come before.""","但是我的愿望是, 如果你把能源生产变得经济了，同时也符合二氧化碳排放限制 但是我的愿望是, 如果你把能源生产变得经济了，同时也符合二氧化碳排放限制 那么怀疑论者会说：好的，虽然我不关心二氧化碳排放的事情 那么怀疑论者会说：好的，虽然我不关心二氧化碳排放的事情 我甚至还有点希望它会排放二氧化碳 但我会采纳这一新方法,因为能源比以前更便宜了 但我会采纳这一新方法,因为能源比以前更便宜了"
"CA: And so, that would be your response to the Bjorn Lomborg argument,  that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem,  it's going to take away all your other goals  of trying to rid the world of poverty and malaria and so forth,  it's a stupid waste of the Earth's resources to put money towards that  when there are better things we can do.","主持人: 是否可以说，这就是你对比约恩隆伯格的回应 也就是说，如果你花所有精力来解决二氧化碳的问题，那就会取代其他目标 也就是说，如果你花所有精力来解决二氧化碳的问题，那就会取代其他目标 比如解决世界贫困, 或者疟疾等等的目标 把钱投到那些领域是对资本的浪费，我们有更重要的事情要做 把钱投到那些领域是对资本的浪费，我们有更重要的事情要做"
"BG: Well, the actual spending on the R&amp;D piece --  say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now --  it's not that dramatic.",盖茨：实际的研发投入其实没多少，虽说美国应该每年多投入100亿在这上面，这应该不会影响其他事情 盖茨：实际的研发投入其实没多少，虽说美国应该每年多投入100亿在这上面，这应该不会影响其他事情 盖茨：实际的研发投入其实没多少，虽说美国应该每年多投入100亿在这上面，这应该不会影响其他事情
It shouldn't take away from other things.,盖茨：实际的研发投入其实没多少，虽说美国应该每年多投入100亿在这上面，这应该不会影响其他事情
"The thing you get into big money on, and this, reasonable people can disagree,  is when you have something that's non-economic and you're trying to fund that --  that, to me, mostly is a waste.","对于需要投巨资的事业, 如果不经济没有回报，对我而言基本是浪费，这点有些人可能持不同意见 对于需要投巨资的事业, 如果不经济没有回报，对我而言基本是浪费，这点有些人可能持不同意见 对于需要投巨资的事业, 如果不经济没有回报，对我而言基本是浪费，这点有些人可能持不同意见"
"Unless you're very close and you're just funding the learning curve  and it's going to get very cheap,  I believe we should try more things that have a potential  to be far less expensive.","除非你已经很接近成功, 而且你在投资学习曲线，并且它将会变得很便宜 除非你已经很接近成功, 而且你在投资学习曲线，并且它将会变得很便宜 否则，我认为我们应该多方尝试具有低成本潜力的方案 否则，我认为我们应该多方尝试具有低成本潜力的方案"
"If the trade-off you get into is, ""Let's make energy super expensive,""  then the rich can afford that.",如果为了解决气候问题，最后让能源变的异常昂贵，贵到只有富人用得起 如果为了解决气候问题，最后让能源变的异常昂贵，贵到只有富人用得起
"I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy  and not change our lifestyle.",对在坐各位来说，如果能源价格提高五倍，还不至于影响我们的生活方式 对在坐各位来说，如果能源价格提高五倍，还不至于影响我们的生活方式
The disaster is for that two billion.,但对地球上那二十亿穷人来说就是个灾难了
And even Lomborg has changed.,而且隆伯格的观点已经变了，他的论点现在是，为什么研究没有得到更多的关注
"His shtick now is, ""Why isn't the R&amp;D getting more discussed?""",而且隆伯格的观点已经变了，他的论点现在是，为什么研究没有得到更多的关注
"He's still, because of his earlier stuff,  still associated with the skeptic camp,  but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp,  and so, he's making the R&amp;D point.","基于历史的原因, 他还是属于怀疑论阵营，但是他已经意识到那是个相当孤独的阵营 基于历史的原因, 他还是属于怀疑论阵营，但是他已经意识到那是个相当孤独的阵营 基于历史的原因, 他还是属于怀疑论阵营，但是他已经意识到那是个相当孤独的阵营 所以,他开始摆出关于研发方面的观点"
And so there is a thread of something that I think is appropriate.,我觉得那是一个非常值得探讨的话题，因为对科研的投入之少实在是不可理喻
"The R&amp;D piece, it's crazy how little it's funded.",我觉得那是一个非常值得探讨的话题，因为对科研的投入之少实在是不可理喻
"CA: Well Bill, I suspect I speak on the behalf of most people here  to say I really hope your wish comes true. Thank you so much.","主持人：比尔, 我想这里的大多数人都跟我一样，真心希望你的梦想成真，非常感谢！ 主持人：比尔, 我想这里的大多数人都跟我一样，真心希望你的梦想成真，非常感谢！"
BG: Thank you.,盖茨：谢谢大家
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago  while writing an article for Italian Wired.,"我想把我几个月之前的一个大发现与大家分享一下 我当时正在为一家意大利杂志""Wired""写一篇文章"
"I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,  but I'd already finished editing the piece,  and I realized that I had never once in my life  looked up the word ""disabled"" to see what I'd find.",我在写作的时候总是把同义词词典放在手边 我当时已经把文章编辑完了 才意识到我一生中还从来没有 在字典中查找“残疾的”的具体意思
Let me read you the entry.,让我把这个词条念给大家听
"""Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,  stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,  run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,  senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in  cracked-up, counted-out;  see also hurt, useless and weak.",“残疾的”，形容词，意为：“残废的，无助的，无用的，残破的 停滞的，被破坏的，受伤的，被损毁的，跛脚的，被肢解的 破损的，累坏了的，虚弱的，无力的，丧失力量的，瘫痪的，身体功能存在障碍的 衰老的，破旧的，被闲置的，精疲力尽的，没用的，疲劳的 破烂的，不被考虑的” 另见：“受伤的，无用的，虚弱的”
"Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable.""",反义词：“健康的，强壮的，有能力的”
"I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,  it was so ludicrous,  but I'd just gotten past ""mangled,"" and my voice broke,  and I had to stop and collect myself  from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.",我当时把以上内容出声地读给我一个朋友听，一开始我笑了 这太荒唐了 当我念到“被损毁了”的时候，我哽咽了 我不得不停下来 让自己被这些词汇打击与侮辱后恢复情绪
"You know, of course, this is my raggedy old thesaurus  so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?",是的，我的这本老同义词词典也很破旧了 我想，这本词典也一定是很老的版本了
"But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,  when I would have been starting primary school  and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit  and as related to the other kids and the world around me.",但实际上，它的出版日期却是上世纪80年代 当时我应该刚上小学 在家庭之外的大环境下形成对自己的认知 并且与我身边的孩子们和世界建立联系
"And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.",谢天谢地，我当年没用过同义词词典 我的意思是，通过同义词词典上对“残疾的”这一词的解释
"I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world  that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,  when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures  my life has procured.",就能看出，我所生活的世界并不认可像我这样的残疾人 这个世界认为我们残疾人身上毫无积极向上的因素 然而今天，我却在为我人生为我带来的一切历险与机会 庆幸不已
"So, I immediately went to look up the 2009 online edition,  expecting to find a revision worth noting.",所以，我立刻上网查“残疾的”这一词在2009年版本同义词词典中的解释 我当时期待着看到一些重要的修订
Here's the updated version of this entry.,下面我给大家读“残疾的”这一词新版本的解释
"Unfortunately, it's not much better.",很不幸，词条的解释没比当年强多少
"I find the last two words under ""Near Antonyms,"" particularly unsettling:  ""whole"" and ""wholesome.""","这个词条中""接近反义词""中的两个词尤其让我很不好受 它们是：“完整的，健全的”"
"So, it's not just about the words.",实际上，这不仅仅是几个单词的事
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.,当人们用那种消极的词汇形容残疾人的时候，实际上反映出来的是人们对残疾人的看法
"It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.",值得注意的是描述残疾人的那些词汇的背后所体现的人们内心的价值观，以及这种价值观形成的过程
Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world  and how we view other people.,我们的语言影响着我们的思维 以及我们看待这个世界的方式、看待他人的方式
"In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,  believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,  because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.",实际上，包括古希腊、古罗马等许多古代社会 都相信言语诅咒的巨大威力 因为话一旦被说了出来，便是真实地存在了
"So, what reality do we want to call into existence:  a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?",那么，我们究竟想让什么样的事物存在呢 是一个没有能力的人，还是一个有能力的人呢
"By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,  we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.",有时候，我们只是随便地给一个成人或孩子命名 却有可能限制住了他们的发展，给他们蒙上阴影，让他们对自己的能力质疑
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?,难道我们不想为他们开启心灵之门么
"One such person who opened doors for me was my childhood doctor  at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.",我的生命中就有这样一个人，为我开启了心灵之门，他是在我小时候照顾我的一位医生 他在德拉华州威尔明顿的A.I. Dupont研究院工作
"His name was Dr. Pizzutillo,  an Italian American, whose name, apparently,  was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,  so he went by Dr. P.",他的名字叫Pizzutillo 是一位意大利裔美国人 很显然，他的名字很多美国人念出来都很困难 下面不妨就叫他P医生好了
"And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties  and had the very perfect disposition to work with children. I loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital,  with the exception of my physical therapy sessions.",P医生总是打着色彩鲜艳的领结 他为人的修养、气质使得他和孩子们相处得很好 除了身体训练课程之外
"I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises  with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors,  you know -- to help build up my leg muscles,  and I hated these bands more than anything --  I hated them, had names for them. I hated them.",我在他的医院里面度过的时光都是很快乐的 我要用那种很粗的、五颜六色的、富有弹性的带子 一遍又一遍地做着体能训练 锻炼腿部肌肉 我简直恨透那些带子了 恨透了，我甚至还给它们都起了名字
"And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,  with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,  unsuccessfully, of course.",当时我还是个五岁的孩子，便和P医生讨价还价 求他别再让我那些体能训练了 当然，我没有得逞
"And, one day, he came in to my session --  exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions --  and he said to me, ""Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,  I think you're going to break one of those bands.",然而有一天，P医生在我做体能训练的时候来看我了 嗯，那些无情的、令人精疲力尽的体能训练 然后他对我说：“艾米，你真是个强壮的小姑娘啊 我感觉有一天你能把这些带子弄断
"When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks.""",你弄断的时候，我就奖励你100美元“
"Now, of course, this was a simple ploy on Dr. P's part  to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do  before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,  but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence  into a new and promising experience for me.",很显然，这是P医生的一个小把戏罢了 他只不过是想让我做这些我根本不爱做的体能训练 用“有一天变成所有二楼病房五岁病人中最富有的”来诱惑我 但是P医生确实成功做到了一件事情 那便是将一个我所痛恨的日程转化为一个全新的、充满了前景的经历
"And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision  and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl  shaped my own view of myself  as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.",今天，我常常在思考，P医生当年的视野 以及他给我的“强壮的小姑娘”这一称谓 对我自我认知的影响有多么大 现如今，我已经能认识到我的内在是强壮有力的，我的未来一片光明
This is an example of how adults in positions of power  can ignite the power of a child.,P医生的这个例子就很好的说明了 一位拥有力量的成年人能够点燃一个孩子的潜能
"But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,  our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,  the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.",但是，在更前面提到的那个同义词词典的例子中 我们的语言并没能让我们把我们所希望看到的事物变成现实 并没能让残疾人意识到他们自己实际上是有能力的
"Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,  Certainly, from a medical standpoint,  my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,  titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies  that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,  and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them --  not to mention social networking platforms  allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,",科技的发展带动社会的发展 而我们的语言并没有随着社会与时俱进 当然，从医学的角度来讲 我的假腿，修复我视力的激光手术 人工钛金膝盖，为老年人提供的股骨头替换手术 种种这些技术都能使得人们更充分地运用他们的能力 并且超越自然环境施加给他们的种种限制 并且为我们这些残疾人搭建社交平台 让我们这些人能自我认同
so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.,从而允许我们在全球范围内选择结交的对象
"So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now  what has always been a truth:  that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,  and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.",所以说，科技正更清楚地向我们展示着 一个永恒的真理 那就是，我们每一个人都是非常强大的，都是能为社会做贡献的 以及适应环境的能力是人类最伟大的资本
"The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,  because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,  and I'm going to make an admission:  This phrase never sat right with me,  and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,  and I think I'm starting to figure out why.",谈起人类适应环境这一本领，我感觉很有意思 因为人们经常想让我就“克服逆境”这一话题讲一讲 今天我想做一点声明 “克服逆境”这一说对我来说根本不成立 别人让我就这一话题说几句的时候，我很不自在 我开始思考为什么会这样
"Implicit in this phrase of ""overcoming adversity""  is the idea that success, or happiness,  is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience  unscathed or unmarked by the experience,  as if my successes in life have come about from an ability  to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,  or what other people perceive as my disability.",“克服逆境”这个词有一个隐含的意思 那就是成功，或者快乐 都在一段艰难的经历的另一端 而这段经历本身却与成功和快乐无关 就好像是说，我这一生之所以能成功 是因为我绕过了作为一个截肢人所要面临的一系列挑战 绕过在别人看来制约我的一些因素
"But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,  whether physically, emotionally or both.",但实际上，这些挑战实实在在地改变了我们，在我们的人生旅程中烙下了印记 这种改变可能是身体上的，可能是精神上的，也可能两者兼具
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.,我想说的是，面临挑战不失为一件好事
Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around  in order to resume living our life.,面对逆境，我们不应把它当成障碍绕过它 从而继续我们的生活
It's part of our life.,其实，逆境是我们生活的一部分
And I tend to think of it like my shadow.,我把逆境想象成我自己的影子
"Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,  but it's always with me.",有的时候它看起来很大，有的时候很小 但是它始终在我身边
"And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.",当然，我不是试图贬低人们与逆境作斗争的价值和意义
"There is adversity and challenge in life,  and it's all very real and relative to every single person,  but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,  but how you're going to meet it.",我们在一生中注定要经历逆境与挑战 我们每个人都是 但是我们所关注的问题并不是你是否要去面对逆境 而是如何去面对它
"So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,  but preparing them to meet it well.",所以，我们的责任不是简简单单地让我们关心的人生活在温床里 而是让他们能够形成从容应对逆境的能力
And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.,当我们让孩子们觉得自己没有适应环境的能力时
There's an important difference and distinction  between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee  and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.,我们实际上伤害了他们 从医学的角度客观地判断我是否是一个残疾人 从社会的角度主观地去考虑我是否是一个“残疾人” 此两者间有很大的差别
"And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront  is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.",实际上，我自始至终所要面对的唯一的一个问题 是这个世界对我的种种不公的看法和描述
"In our desire to protect those we care about  by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,  or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,  we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall  that will actually disable someone.",我们希望能够保护那些我们在意的人们 我们把冷冰冰的医师诊断报告告诉他们 或者有时候，为他们未来的生活状态做预测 但是我们一定要注意我们的所做所为 是否会摧毁这些人们 也许，人们习惯了只专注于自己的种种缺陷 并想着如何修复这些缺陷
"Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself.",这种思维定式对残疾人的伤害比残疾人本身的生理缺陷更严重
"By not treating the wholeness of a person,  by not acknowledging their potency,  we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.",我们不从一个整体的角度看待残疾人 不去承认他们的能力 这对他们本身就很艰难的处境无疑是雪上加霜
We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.,我们能有效地对一个人对其所在社会的的价值进行评估
So we need to see through the pathology  and into the range of human capability.,因此，我们的目光不应该局限在残疾人生理上的缺陷 而是应该注意到他们作为人的价值
"And, most importantly, there's a partnership  between those perceived deficiencies  and our greatest creative ability.",另外，最重要的一点 残疾人的一些缺陷和人类的创造力之间 是存在着联系的
"So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times  as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,  but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.",所以，艰辛的奋斗岁月是不该被贬低、否定的 这不是什么我们要避免或者掩盖的事 恰恰相反，我们应该在逆境中寻找机遇
"So maybe the idea I want to put out there is  not so much overcoming adversity  as it is opening ourselves up to it,  embracing it,  grappling with it,  to use a wrestling term,  maybe even dancing with it.","其实，我想说明的道理就是 逆境，不是用来""克服""的 我们应该坦然面对它 拥抱它 与它摔打 我刚才用了一个摔角的术语（摔打） 甚至，与它舞蹈"
"And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,  we're less burdened by the presence of it.",也许，如果我们能把逆境看成是自然的、不间断的、对人有用的东西 它的存在对我们来说也不再是负担了
"This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,  and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,  that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.",今年我们庆祝了达尔文的200周年诞辰 当达尔文在150年前写物种进化论的时候 他阐明了一个关于人类特征的真理
"To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,  nor is it the most intelligent that survives;  it is the one that is most adaptable to change.",他说的那句话大概意思就是，能生存下来的物种 往往不是最强壮的，也不是最聪明的 而是最能适应外部环境变化的
Conflict is the genesis of creation.,矛盾冲突是创造之母
"From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that  the human ability to survive and flourish  is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict  into transformation.",达尔文等诸位大师的著作都揭示了这一点 人类生存繁衍的能力 源自人类灵魂经历激烈斗争后的转变 就是这样
"So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.",我再重申一遍，人类最伟大的能力，是转变和适应
"And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.",也许，在我们接受考验之前，我们不知道自己会是什么样子
"Maybe that's what adversity gives us:  a sense of self, a sense of our own power.",可能这就是逆境所能起到的作用 一种对自我以及个人能力的认识
"So, we can give ourselves a gift.",所以，我们可以给自己一份礼物
We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.,我们可以把逆境想成一次改变的机遇
Maybe we can see it as change.,而不是艰辛的岁月
Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.,逆境是一种改变，而我们只不过还没来得及对其适应
I think the greatest adversity that we've created for ourselves  is this idea of normalcy.,"我认为，我们给自己创造的最大的困境 是""正统""这一概念"
"Now, who's normal?",好吧，究竟什么又是“正统”呢
There's no normal.,“正统”并不存在
"There's common, there's typical. There's no normal,  and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?",我知道什么是“普通的”，什么是“典型的”，但我不知道什么是“正统的” 如果真的有那种贫困的、面黄肌瘦的所谓的“正统人”，你会对他们感兴趣么
I don't think so.,我想不会吧
"If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy  to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous --  we can release the power of so many more children,  and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.",如果我们不把精力投入到追求“正统”当中 而是投入到发现各种各样的可能性，发掘各种各样的能力，冒险一下 很多孩子的潜能都会被更好的激发 他们将会充分运用他们独一无二的宝贵的能力，为他们的社区做贡献
"Anthropologists tell us that the one thing  we as humans have always required of our community members  is to be of use, to be able to contribute.",人类学家告诉我们 我们作为人类总是希望我们所在群体中的人们是有用的 是有能力做贡献的
"There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,  carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,  and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people  proved of value to the community.",六万年前的尼安德特社会就是一个很好的证据 尼安德特人抚养他们社会中的老弱病残 因为他们坚信 老人们丰富的人生阅历是对他们整个社会是很有价值的
They didn't view these people as broken and useless;  they were seen as rare and valuable.,老人们从来不会被视作无用的 相反，他们被视为非常珍贵的
"A few years ago, I was in a food market in the town where I grew up  in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,  and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.",几年前的一天，我正在故乡的菜市场 就是宾州东北部的那片红区 我当时正站在一筐西红柿旁边
It was summertime: I had shorts on.,因为正值夏天，我穿的是短裤
"I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, ""Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins.""",在我的身后传来了一个男子的声音“唉？这不是艾米•慕林斯么”
"And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.",我转过身来，发现是一位我不认识的老者
"And I said, ""I'm sorry, sir, have we met? I don't remember meeting you.""",然后我说，“先生不好意思，我们见过面么？我记不得你了”
"He said, ""Well, you wouldn't remember meeting me.",他说，“嗯，你是不会记得咱们之间的那次见面的
"I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb.""",因为当时，我正把你从你母亲的子宫里接生出来“
"Oh, that guy.",呵呵，我遇到的就是这么一个人
"And, but of course, actually, it did click.",当然，最后我想起来了
"This man was Dr. Kean,  a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,  because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.",这个人就是基恩大夫 我只是通过母亲当年给我讲的故事才知道这么一个人 我是一个晚产儿，晚产了两周
"And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,  so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.",当时负责在我母亲临产期照顾她的医生度假去了 所以最后就由基恩大夫这个我父母之前都不认识的人给我接生了
"And, because I was born without the fibula bones,  and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,  he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.",我出生的时候就没有腓骨 我的脚、脚趾都错位了 基恩大夫不得不传达两个坏消息
"He said to me, ""I had to give this prognosis to your parents  that you would never walk,  and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have  or any kind of life of independence,  and you've been making liar out of me ever since.""","他对我说,""我当年把诊断报告告诉了你父母 我说，你将永远不会行走 你也永远不会像其他孩子那样跑跑跳跳 你将永远无法独立的生活 可从那以后，你却通过你的努力把我变成了一个大骗子”"
"The extraordinary thing is that he said he had saved  newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,  whether winning a second grade spelling bee,  marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,  winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,  and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,  med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.",（鼓掌） 基恩先生做了一件伟大的事情 他从我童年开始就把报纸上所有关于我的报道都剪下来收集了 其中包括我二年级的时候在一次拼字比赛中获胜 和女童子军在万圣节的时候参加游行 大学的时候获得奖学金，以及我种种在体育比赛中的成绩 基恩大夫在用我的故事教育当地的学生们 他用我的故事教育哈奈曼医学院和赫尔希医学院的学生
"And he called this part of the course the X Factor,  the potential of the human will.",他把我的这些故事叫做他课程中的X因素 叫做人类意志所激发的无穷潜力
No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be  as a determinant in the quality of someone's life.,没有任何医疗诊断能够解释这种意志的威力有多么巨大 意志能影响一个人的生活质量
"And Dr. Kean went on to tell me,  he said, ""In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,  and even if given a modicum of support,  if left to their own devices, a child will achieve.""",基恩大夫继续对我说 “尽管有很多次别人都反驳我的观点，根据我的经历 对于孩子们，即使给予他们的支持很少 他们自己也能有所成就”
"See, Dr. Kean made that shift in thinking.",看吧，基恩大夫的想法改变了
He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition  and what someone might do with it.,他认识到了医疗诊断的结果以及一个人处理这种结果的方式之间 是存在差异的
"And there's been a shift in my thinking over time,  in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,  if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,  I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.",几年来，我的想法也有了一定的转变 比如，如果你在我15岁的时候问我 愿不愿意用我现在的假肢换一双真腿 我会毫不犹豫地答应
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.,因为我渴望得到那种“正统”
"But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.",但是如果你今天问我同样的问题，我就要三思了
"And it's because of the experiences I've had with them,  not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.",这是因为我使用假肢的这段经历 对我的影响很大 也许，我已经由内而外地脱胎换骨了
And perhaps this shift in me has happened  because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.,因为，在我所遇到的人里面 为我开启通向新世界的门的人远远多于给我心灵蒙上阴影的人
"See, all you really need is one person  to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.",看吧，你们所需要的就是这样一个人 他能向你展示你自己的力量 人类的灵魂是包容的
"If you can hand somebody the key to their own power --  the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment,  you are educating them in the best sense.",如果你能够给他人一把钥匙，让他自己用这把钥匙开启自己的力量 并且在关键时刻，你能用这把钥匙为别人开启一扇门 你就是在用最好的方式对他们进行教育
You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.,因为你在教他们自己为自己开启通向新世界之门
"In fact, the exact meaning of the word ""educate""  comes from the root word ""educe.""",实际上，“教育”这个词的意义 来源于“唤出”这个词
"It means ""to bring forth what is within,  to bring out potential.""",“唤出”，即把深藏在里面的东西引出来 发掘潜能
"So again, which potential do we want to bring out?",那么，我们究竟希望发掘出什么样的潜能呢
"There was a case study done in 1960s Britain,  when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.",这里有个上世纪60年代英国的案例 英国的孩子从小学升到初中这一过程
"It's called the streaming trials. We call it ""tracking"" here in the States.",在英国叫做“统考”，在美国我们管它叫“追踪考试”
"It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.",考试把学生们按照成绩从高到低分成A、B、C、D四等
"And the ""A students"" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.",A等的学生学更难的课程，有更好的老师，等等
"Well, they took, over a three-month period,  D-level students, gave them A's,  told them they were ""A's,"" told them they were bright,  and at the end of this three-month period,  they were performing at A-level.",这个实验为期三个月 按照成绩应该被归为D等学生被告知他们是A等的学生 他们被告知自己是非常聪明的 三个月的实验结束的时候 这群学生的表现已经相当于A等生了
"And, of course, the heartbreaking, flip side of this study,  is that they took the ""A students"" and told them they were ""D's.""",当然，这个案例研究也有其令人心寒的另一面 那就是，那些本应该被归为A等的学生被告知他们是D等学生
And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.,三个月的实验结束的时候
"Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.",他们中的很多人已经辍学了
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.,这个实验的一个要点就是，参与实验的老师们也是不知情的
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.,老师们不知道学生被调包了
"They were simply told, ""These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'""  And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.","老师们只是被告知哪些是A等生，哪些是D等生 老师也随即""因材施教""了"
"So, I think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit,  a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,  it doesn't see beauty,  it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity  and our innate ability to imagine.",所以，我认为真正的“残疾”是一个被击败的灵魂 一个对未来没有希望的灵魂 一个无法感知美好的灵魂 一个丧失了孩子般天真的好奇心的灵魂 一个丧失了人类与生俱来的想象力的灵魂
"If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,  to see beauty in themselves and others,  to be curious and imaginative,  then we are truly using our power well.",假如，我们能够让人类的灵魂始终保持希望 让这灵魂能看到自己以及他人的美 赋予这灵魂好奇心以及想象力 那么我们就算是在很好地运用自己的力量了
"When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities  and new ways of being.",只要一个灵魂仍然具备上述的那些品质，那么它就能创造无限可能 以及新的生活方式
"I'd like to leave you with a poem  by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz  that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,  and the poem is called ""The God Who Only Knows Four Words"":  ""Every child has known God,  not the God of names,  not the God of don'ts,  but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,  saying, 'Come dance with me.","我想在最后送给大家一首诗 诗的作者是十四世纪的波斯诗人哈菲斯 这首诗是我的一个朋友，雅克•邓波讲给我的 诗的名字叫《一个只知道四个字的神》 ""每个孩子都知道神的存在 不是有名字的神 不是给你施加种种金规玉律的神 而是一个只会说四个字，并且一遍又一遍重复着它们的神 祂在说，与我共舞"
"Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'""  Thank you.",与我共舞！” 谢谢大家

"About three or four years ago,  I got a phone call in the middle of the night  from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,  who said, ""I need to see you.",大约三四年之前 我在深夜接到了一通 来自于那个老师，普斯顿老师的电话 她说，“我需要见你
I'm disappointed  that we never got to know each other as adults.,我很失望 我们从来没有以成年人的姿态互相了解
"Could you please come to Ohio,  and please bring that man  that I know you have found by now.",你能来俄亥俄吗 请把那个你 寻找到的人也带过来

It's something we knew how to do.,有些事我们需要知道如何去做
"And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult  got to know me,  she turned into a box of ashes  and was placed in my hands.",就是这个把我当做成年人看待 想了解我的女生 最终化成了盒中的粉末 安置在我的手中
"And what had happened  was the circle had closed,  it had become a circle --  and that epiphany I talked about  presented itself.",所发生的 就是循环的结束 这就形成了一个循环-- 其中我所说的顿悟 就得到了自我体现
The epiphany is  that death is a part of life.,这顿悟是 死亡是生命的一部分

Thank you.,谢谢
"As an artist,  connection is very important to me.",作为一名艺术家， 联系对我来说是非常重要的 。
Through my work I'm trying to articulate  that humans are not separate from nature  and that everything is interconnected.,通过我的艺术作品我试着阐明 人类不是与自然分隔开 而是每一件事都是互相联系的。
"I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago,  where I saw my first icebergs.",大约10年前我第一次去了南极洲， 我也第一次看到了冰山。
I was in awe.,我感到敬畏。
"My heart beat fast, my head was dizzy,  trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me.",我的心快速地砰动，头晕目眩， 试着理解在我面前的这到底是什么。
"The icebergs around me  were almost 200 feet out of the water,  and I could only help but wonder  that this was one snowflake  on top of another snowflake,  year after year.",在我身边的冰山 浮出水面几乎200英尺。 我只能感到很奇怪 这就是一片雪花 覆盖在另一片雪花， 年复一年形成的。
Icebergs are born  when they calve off of glaciers  or break off of ice shelves.,冰山的形成是 当它们从冰川断裂开 或者从冰架上断裂开。
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.,每个冰山都有它们自己的独特个性。
They have a distinct way  of interacting with their environment  and their experiences.,它们 与其周边的环境 和其情况的互动具有一个鲜明的方式。
"Some refuse to give up  and hold on to the bitter end,  while others can't take it anymore  and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion.",有些冰山拒绝妥协 坚持到底， 而另一些冰山就不能忍受 在一时剧烈激情喷涌下就水崩冰裂。
"It's easy to think, when you look at an iceberg,  that they're isolated,  that they're separate and alone,  much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves.",当你看到冰山，很容易就想到 它们都是孤立的， 它们是独立的，单独一体的， 更像是我们人类有时候对自身的看法。
But the reality is far from it.,但现实远不止这个。
"As an iceberg melts,  I am breathing in  its ancient atmosphere.",随着冰山融化， 我呼吸到 它古老的气味。
"As the iceberg melts,  it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water  that nourishes many forms of life.",随着冰山融化， 它释放了富有矿物质的鲜水 它们滋养了万物。
"I approach photographing these icebergs  as if I'm making portraits of my ancestors,  knowing that in these individual moments  they exist in that way  and will never exist that way again.",我着手拍摄这些冰山 好似我在拍摄我祖先的肖像， 了解到在这些个别的时刻 冰山原是以那样方式存在 但再也不会像那样存在了。
"It is not a death when they melt;  it is not an end,  but a continuation  of their path through the cycle of life.",当它们融化时，这绝不是死亡； 也绝不是一个终结， 而是 通往生生不息之路的一个延续。
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --  a couple thousand years old.,我拍摄过的冰山，有些冰是非常年轻-- 几千年年龄。
"And some of the ice  is over 100,000 years old.",有些冰 超过十万年。
"The last pictures I'd like to show you  are of an iceberg that I photographed  in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.",我想给大家展示的最后图片 是我在格陵兰岛的 Kekertsuatsiak上拍摄的一个冰山。
It's a very rare occasion  that you get to actually witness  an iceberg rolling.,这是一个非常难得的机会 大家实际上得以见证 一个冰山翻滚。
So here it is.,所以这就如图所示。
You can see on the left side a small boat.,在左边你能看到一个小船。
That's about a 15-foot boat.,这是一个约15英尺的船。
And I'd like you to pay attention  to the shape of the iceberg  and where it is at the waterline.,我想让你注意 冰山的形状 它在水面上的变形。
"You can see here, it begins to roll,  and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.",在这儿你看到它开始翻滚， 小船移动到另一边，一个男人站在那里。
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.,这是一个平均尺寸的格陵兰冰山。
"It's about 120 feet above the water,  or 40 meters.",它浮出水面大约有120英尺高 或者40米高。
And this video is real time.,这视频是实时拍摄的。
"And just like that,  the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.",就像这冰山， 它们展示给大家的是其个性的不同方面。
Thank you.,谢谢。
"I want you to imagine two couples  in the middle of 1979  on the exact same day, at the exact same moment,  each conceiving a baby -- okay?",我希望大家设想一下， 两对夫妇 在1979年的年中 在相同的一天，相同的时刻 每对怀上了一个孩子 -- 好
So two couples each conceiving one baby.,那么两对夫妇各自都都怀上了一个孩子
"Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception,  you're not going to listen to me.",现在，我不希望大家花太多的时间去想象怀孕 因为如果你花太多时间去想它 你就不会听我说了
So just imagine that for a moment.,所以稍微想一下就好了
"And in this scenario,  I want to imagine that, in one case,  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,  meeting that X chromosome of the egg.",那么在这种情况下 我来设想一下，一个个例是 携带着Y染色体的精子 遇到携带着X染色体的卵子
"And in the other case,  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,  meeting the X chromosome of the egg.",另一个是 携带着X染色体的精子 遇到携带着X染色体的卵子
Both are viable; both take off.,两个都存活下来了，两个都开始发育
We'll come back to these people later.,我们之后再来看这两对夫妇
So I wear two hats  in most of what I do.,我担任两个角色 在我所从事的领域
"As the one hat,  I do history of anatomy.",一个角色是 我做解剖学历史研究
"I'm a historian by training,  and what I study in that case  is the way that people have dealt with anatomy --  meaning human bodies, animal bodies --  how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;  how have they thought about bodies.",我是个史学工作者 我所研究的是 人类是怎么对待解剖学的—— 对无论是人类躯体，或是动物躯体—— 他们如何处理体液，抽象的躯体 他们是如何看待躯体的
"The other hat that I've worn in my work  is as an activist,  as a patient advocate --  or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --  for people who are patients of doctors.",另一个角色是 一名社会活动家 作为一个为病人辩护人的角色—— 或者说，像我有时候说的，作为医生们的病人的辩护人—— 我是很激进的
"In that case, what I've worked with  is people who have body types  that challenge social norms.",那样的话，在我工作中 所接触到的是一些 挑战着社会规范的人
"So some of what I've worked on, for example,  is people who are conjoined twins --  two people within one body.",比如，我接触到的一些人 是连体婴儿 两个人共用一个身体
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --  so people who are much shorter than typical.,还有一些是侏儒症患者 他们比一般人要矮小的多
And a lot of what I've worked on  is people who have atypical sex --  so people who don't have the standard male  or the standard female body types.,另外，许多我接触的人 他们的性别与众不同 -- 即他们没有很标准的男性特征 或者女性特有的身体特征
"And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.",总的来说，这个症状可以被叫做双性人
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.,双性可以有多种的形式
I'll just give you a few examples  of the types of ways you can have sex  that isn't standard for male or female.,我来举几个例子 来说明你可以具有 既不是标准的男性特征也不是标准的女性特征的类型
"So in one instance,  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome  tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,  to become testes.",例子之一 一个人可以拥有XY染色体 并且，在Y染色体上的SRY基因 刺激我们在胎儿时期都有的原始性腺 使其变成睾丸
And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.,因此在胎儿时期，睾丸分泌睾丸激素
"But because this individual lacks receptors  to hear that testosterone,  the body doesn't react to the testosterone.",但是这个个体缺少受体 来接收睾丸激素 身体不能对睾丸激素做出反应
And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.,这是一种叫做睾丸不敏感综合征
"So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.",所以，睾丸激素的量很大，但是不能引起反应
"As a consequence, the body develops  more along the female typical path.",因此，身体就会朝着 女性化的趋势发展
"When the child is born, she looks like a girl.",当婴儿诞生时，她看起来像个女孩儿
She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.,她就是女孩儿，并且被当作小姑娘来抚养
"And it's often not until she hits puberty  and she's growing and developing breasts,  but she's not getting her period,  that somebody figures out something's up here.",大多数情况，直到青春期 她的胸部开始发育的时候 她却没有女性周期 这时我们才会开始怀疑有什么差错
"And they do some tests and figure out  that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,  she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.",于是他们检查发现 她并没有卵巢和子宫 实际上，在她身体内有睾丸，并且她携带着Y染色体
"Now what's important to understand  is you may think of this person as really being male,  but they're really not.",现在，有一个重要问题需要说明的是 大家一定认为这个人实际上是个男孩儿 其实并非如此
"Females, like males,  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.",女性，和男性一样 体内有一个器官叫做肾上腺
They're in the back of our body.,它在我们身体的后端
"And the adrenal glands make androgens,  which are a masculinizing hormone.",并且肾上腺负责分泌雄性激素 即一种雄性荷尔蒙
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --  I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up  but I think I'm probably typical --  most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.,像我一样的大多数女性--我相信我自己是个典型的女性-- 我其实不太清楚我的染色体的组成 但是我想我应该是有典型的女性—— 大多数像我一样的女性实际上是雄激素敏感的
"We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.",我们分泌雄性激素，并且对它有反应
The consequence is that somebody like me  has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens  than the woman born with testes  who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.,结果是，有的像我一样女性， 大脑暴露在过多的雄性激素下 比那个出生时有睾丸的女孩 那个雄性激素不敏感综合征的女孩有的雄性激素还多
"So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people  are in the middle of all the sex spectrum --  in some ways, they can be all over the place.",所以说性别是个非常复杂的东西；并不是说那些双性的人 就处在男性和女性之间—— 在某些方面，他们可以覆盖整个性特征的范围
"Another example:  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,  who was born a boy, raised a boy,  had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,  had a life as a guy  and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.",还有一个例子 几年前，我接到一个十九岁的男孩打来的电话 他生下来是个男孩，也被当作男孩来养 后来有了女朋友，也和女友发生了性关系 一直过着男孩的生活 但是最近，他发现自己体内有卵巢和子宫
What he had was an extreme form  of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.,他所有的是一种很极端的病症 叫做类固醇21-羟化酶缺乏症
"He had XX chromosomes,  and in the womb,  his adrenal glands were in such high gear  that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.",他携带XX染色体 并且在子宫内的时候 他的肾上腺很活跃 从而形成了一个男性荷尔蒙的环境
"And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed,  his brain was subject  to the more typical masculine component of hormones.",结果就是，他发育了男性生殖器官 他的大脑接受了 更多的典型的男性荷尔蒙
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.,因此他生下来看起来像个男孩儿--根本没人怀疑
"And it was only when he had reached the age of 19  that he began to have enough medical problems  actually from menstruating internally,  that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.",只有当他长到19岁的时候 当他开始遇到生理问题的时候 其实是在体内出现月经起 医生发现，实际上他的内部是女性
"Okay, so just one more quick example  of a way you can have intersex.",好，我们再来快速的看一个例子 另一个可能带来两性特征的情况
"Some people who have XX chromosomes  develop what are called ovotestis,  which is when you have ovarian tissue  with testicular tissue wrapped around it.",有XX染色体的一些人 会发育一种叫做卵睾的器官 也就是当卵巢组织 被睾丸组织包裹起来的一种器官
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.,我们还不能确定它的成因
So sex can come in lots of different varieties.,所以说性别可以是很多种形式
"The reason  that children with these kinds of bodies --  whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,  or it's an intersex type --  are often normalized by surgeons  is not because it actually leaves them better off  in terms of physical health.",拥有这些身体特征的 孩子们—— 不论是侏儒症，或者连体婴儿 或者是双性型的—— 常被外科医生手术纠正的原因 实际上并不是为了 身体健康
"In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.",因为很多情况下，他们的身体其实都很健康
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries  is because they threaten our social categories.,他们接受各种外科手术的原因 是因为他们受到我们社会上对人分类的威胁
Or system has been based typically on the idea  that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.,或者说社会上已经有一个典型的认识 什么样的身体结构，有什么样的特征
"So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman  is to have a female identity;  what it means to be a black person is, allegedly,  is to have an African anatomy  in terms of your history.",因此，我们的概念就是作为一个女人 就必须有女性的特性 以此类推，一个黑人 就得具有非洲人的身体结构特征 在你的履历中
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.,因此我们就有了这种过于简单的认识
"And when we're faced with a body  that actually presents us something quite different,  it startles us in terms of those categorizations.",当我们面对一个 某些方面是与众不同的身体的时候 那些不能归类的想法让我们感到吃惊
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture  about individualism.,因此我们的文化中有很多天真的想法 是关于个人主义的
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.,并且我们国家建立在一个非常不实际的个人主义的概念上的
Well you can imagine how startling then it is  when you have children that are born  who are two people inside of one body.,好，你可以想象那多么令人震惊 当你的两个孩子 出生的时候是在一个身体中的
"Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently  was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya,  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.",我最近一次遇到这种情况是 去年的时候，非洲田径运动员，卡斯特尔·塞门亚 在柏林国际比赛中被质疑性别问题
"I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,  ""Which is the test they're going to run  that will tell us whether or not  Caster Semenya is male or female?""",许多记者给我打电话，问我 “他们会用哪种检测方法 来向大家证明 卡斯特尔·塞门亚是男还是女？”
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.,于是我不得不跟他们解释说，根本没有检测的方法
"In fact, we now know  that sex is complicated enough  that we have to admit  nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,  or between male and intersex and female and intersex;  we actually draw that line on nature.",事实上，我们现在已经了解 性别是非常复杂的 我们不得不承认 大自然根本就没有一个明确的分界线来区分男性或女性 或者男性和双性以及女性和双性 这条分界线实际上是我们自己画的
"So what we have is a sort of situation  where the farther our science goes,  the more we have to admit to ourselves  that these categories  that we thought of as stable anatomical categories  that mapped very simply  to stable identity categories  are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.",因此我们现在的情况是 科学越发展 我们越得承认 这些性别的分类形式 也就是我们认为很理所当然的身体结构学上的分类 是过于简单地 给特性分了类 实际情况要比我们想象的模糊的多
And it's not just in terms of sex.,并且这不仅仅是关于性别的问题
"It's also in terms of race,  which turns out to be vastly more complicated  than our terminology has allowed.",也同样是关于种族的问题 这个复杂程度 远不是我们的学术语言所能形容的
"As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.",如我们所见，我们涉及各种各样艰难的领域
"We look, for example, about the fact  that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA  with chimpanzees.",我们来看一个例子，现实情况是 我们用95%的人类的DNA 与大猩猩进行对比
What are we to make of the fact  that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides?,得出的事实是 人类和大猩猩的DNA只是在一些核苷酸上有所不同
"And as we get farther and farther with our science,  we get more and more into a discomforted zone  where we have to acknowledge  that the simplistic categories we've had  are probably overly simplistic.",科技越发展 我们越会涉及到让人苦恼的领域 我们必须承认 那些沿用的简单的分类 是过于简单化了
So we're seeing this  in all sorts of places in human life.,正因如此，我们正在审视着 人类生活中的各个领域
"One of the places we're seeing it, for example,  in our culture today, in the United States today,  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.",其中的一个领域，举个例子 就是我们的文化领域，当今美国的文化领域 热议着生命的起源和终结
"We have difficult conversations  about at what point we decide a body becomes a human,  such that it has a different right than a fetal life.",我们有一个艰难的讨论 关于我们什么时候从一个躯体变成了一个人类 从而有了不同于胎儿的权利
We have very difficult conversations nowadays --  probably not out in the open as much as within medicine --  about the question of when somebody's dead.,我们当今有一个非常有争议的话题—— 也许在外部不如在医学界内争论的激烈—— 是关于何时认定为人死亡的疑问 过去，人死的时候
"In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much  At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,  and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.",我们的祖先从来不会过多的纠结于此 最多也就是把一个羽毛粘在人的鼻子下 如果羽毛动了，旁人就不会把他们埋掉
"If it stopped twitching, you bury them.",如果羽毛不动，就会埋了他们
"But today, we have a situation  where we want to take vital organs out of beings  and give them to other beings.",但是如今的情况都是 我们希望把死者的器官 移植到其他人的身体上
"And as a consequence,  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question  about who's dead,  and this leads us to a really difficult situation  where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.",结果 我们开始纠结在上面所提到的难题中 关于到底死了没有 这导致我们进入一个很困难的情况 这个情况没有之前简单的分类了
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories  would make somebody like me really happy.,现在你也许会想，所有的这些正在崩溃的分类 也许会让像我这样的人感到高兴
"I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.",我是一个在政治观点上不断进步的人，我维护那些身体异于常人的人 但是我必须承认，这种改变让我感到不安
Understanding that these categories  are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.,认识到这些分类制度 比我们想象的还不稳定，使我感到紧张
And it makes me tense  from the point of view of thinking about democracy.,同时，我的紧张来自于 民主的观点
"So in order to tell you about that tension,  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.",所以，为了告诉大家这种紧张的程度 我首先要承认，我是国父们的忠实粉丝
"I know they were racists, I know they were sexist,  but they were great.",我知道他们是种族主义者，他们是男性至上主义者 但是他们非常伟大
"I mean, they were so brave and so bold  and so radical in what they did  that I find myself watching that cheesy musical ""1776"" every few years,  and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.",我的意思是，他们是如此的英勇、无畏 并且积极的从事他们的事业 我自己每隔几年就要重新去欣赏那个挺土的音乐剧“1776”（美国建国史的音乐剧） 并不是因为音乐好，音乐是完全可以被忽略的
It's because of what happened in 1776  with the Founding Fathers.,是因为1776年围绕着 建国者们发生的事情
"The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,  the original anatomical activists,  and this is why.",建国者们，我认为他们是 最早的解剖学活动家 这是我爱他们的原因
What they rejected was an anatomical concept  and replaced it with another one  that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.,他们反对了一个解剖学的概念 并且用另一个取而代之 这个新进的美好的概念保持了200年
"So as you all recall,  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,  and the monarchy was basically based  on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.",大家回忆一下 我们的建国者们反对的是一个君主制度的概念 并且这个君主制是基于 过于简单化的解剖学概念上的
"The monarchs of the old world  didn't have a concept of DNA,  but they did have a concept of birthright.",旧体制下的帝王们 没有DNA的概念 但是他们遵从的是“出身”的理念
They had a concept of blue blood.,他们有贵族的概念
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power  should be in political power  because of the blood being passed down  from grandfather to father to son and so forth.,他们认为，身在政治权力下的人 就应该掌握权力 是因为贵族血统要 从祖父到父亲到儿子一代代传承
"The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,  and that concept  was all men are created equal.",建国者们反对这种观点 他们用一种新的解剖上的概念取而代之 那种概念就是 人人平等
"They leveled that playing field  and decided the anatomy that mattered  was the commonality of anatomy,  not the difference in anatomy,  and that was a really radical thing to do.",他们消除了等级观念 并且确定解剖学的重要性 在于全民平等 而不是出身的贵贱 在当时那确实是一个很激进的改革
Now they were doing it in part  because they were part of an Enlightenment system  where two things were growing up together.,某种程度上，这种改革现在仍然在进行 因为他们是启蒙运动系统的一部分 两件事情是共同发展的
"And that was democracy growing up,  but it was also science growing up at the same time.",民主制度在当时正在形成 但同时科技也在发展
"And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,  a lot of them were very interested in science,  and they were interested in a concept  of a naturalistic world.",非常明显的是，如果你注意一下建国者的历史 他们中的许多人都对科学很感兴趣 并且他们都对自然主义世界这个概念 很感兴趣
"They were moving away from supernatural explanations,  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,  where it transmitted  because of a very vague concept of birthright.",他们摒弃超自然的说法 他们排斥那些关于超自然力量的说法 因为超自然力量的概念被传播 是基于非常模糊的身世的理念
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.,他们倡导自然主义的概念
"And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,  they talk about nature and nature's God.",如果你观察会发现，例如在独立宣言中 他们提及到自然和自然之神
They don't talk about God and God's nature.,他们没有提到上帝和上帝的自然
They're talking about the power of nature  to tell us who we are.,他们提到自然的力量 来解释我们是谁
"So as part of that,  they were coming to us with a concept  that was about anatomical commonality.",因此作为其中的一部分 他们为我们带来一个概念 那就是人人生来平等
"And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way  the Civil Rights movement of the future.",为此 他们确实为将来的民权运动 铺垫了一个很美好的道路
"They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.",他们想不到将来会怎样，但是他们为我们奠定了基础，这是非常伟大的
So what happened years afterward?,那么数年后发生了什么呢？
"What happened was women, for example,  who wanted the right to vote,  took the Founding Fathers' concept  of anatomical commonality being more important  than anatomical difference  and said, ""The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries  is not significant enough in terms of a difference  to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote,  the right to full citizenship,  the right to own property, etc., etc.""",例如在女性身上都发生了什么 她们渴望投票的权利 按照建国者的概念 人人平等要远重要于 人的出身 她们说：“我们有子宫和卵巢是事实 这些不同完全不足以 意味着我们没有投票权 没有充分的公民权利 没有私人财产权等等”
And women successfully argued that.,女性的主张获得了成效
"Next came the successful Civil Rights movement,  where we found people like Sojourner Truth  talking about, ""Ain't I a woman?""",接下来便是成功的民权运动 运动中出现了像索杰纳·特鲁思这样的人 她的名言“我就不是女人吗？”
"We find men  on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement  saying, ""I am a man.""",我们知道男人 曾经在民权运动的发展路线上 有句名言“我是个男人”
"Again, people of color  appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy,  again, successfully.",此外，有色人群 呼吁人人平等而不应种族歧视 再者，
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.,我们看到同样的成功案例发生在伤残人士的权利运动中
"The problem is, of course,  that, as we begin to look at all that commonality,  we have to begin to question  why we maintain certain divisions.",问题是，当然 当我们开始去审视所有的公民 我们不得不开始质疑 为什么我们去维护一个固定的界限
"Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions,  anatomically, in our culture.",现在，需要提醒大家的是，我希望去保持一些界限 身体结构上的，在我们的文化范围被内
"For example, I don't want  to give a fish the same rights as a human.",举个例子，我不希望 给予鱼和人类一样的权利
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.,我不希望我们放弃一切在解剖学上的区分界限
I don't want to say five-year-olds  should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.,我不希望，一个五岁的孩子 可以被允许有性行为或者说允许结婚
So there are some anatomical divisions  that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.,所以说，有一些在解剖学上的界限 对我们来说是有意义的，我想那些应该被保留
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are  and why do we retain them and do they have meaning.,但是，艰巨的任务是试着去找出哪些是应该保留的 为什么我们要保留它们，它们有什么意义
So let's go back to those two beings  conceived at the beginning of this talk.,所以，让我们回到刚才说到的那两人 就是演讲一开始所虚构的那两个人
"We have two beings, both conceived  in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.",我们有两对夫妇 都在1979年年中的同一天怀孕了
"Let's imagine one of them, Mary,  is born three months prematurely,  so she's born on June 1, 1980.",让我们设想一下，玛丽 提前三个月出生了 因此她出生于1980年6月1日
"Henry, by contrast, is born at term,  so he's born on March 1, 1980.",亨利，相反的，足月出生 他出生于1980年3月1日
"Simply by virtue of the fact  that Mary was born prematurely three months,  she comes into all sorts of rights  three months earlier than Henry does --  the right to consent to sex,  the right to vote, the right to drink.",仅仅是由于 玛丽早出生了三个月这个事实 她获得各种权利的时间 要比亨利早三个月 允许有性行为的权利 选举的权利，喝酒的权利
"Henry has to wait for all of that,  not because he's actually any different in age, biologically,  except in terms of when he was born.",亨利就不得不等待 他的生理学年龄没有任何不同 只是因为他出生的时间不同
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.,我们还发现其他一些离奇的权利问题
"Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male --  although I haven't told you that he's the XY one --  by virtue of being assumed to be male  is now liable to be drafted,  which Mary does not need to worry about.",亨利，由于被假定为男性-- 尽管我没有告诉过大家他是XY型染色体—— 由于被假定为男性 所以现在要应征入伍 玛丽就不需要去担心这些
"Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states  have the same right that Henry has in all the states,  namely, the right to marry.",与此同时，玛丽不能在所有的州 像亨利一样享受同样权利 也就是，结婚的权利
"Henry can marry in every state a woman,  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.",亨利可以在任何一个州结婚 但是玛丽如今只能在少数几个州娶一位女性
So we have these anatomical categories that persist  that are in many ways problematic and questionable.,因此我们所坚持的一些结构上的生物分类 它们在很多方面是有问题并且需要质疑的
"And the question to me becomes:  What do we do,  as our science gets to be so good  in looking at anatomy,  that we reach the point where we have to admit  that a democracy that's been based on anatomy  might start falling apart?",对我来说，问题就变成了： 我们要做什么 当我们的科学在解剖学上 如此先进的时候 我们已经到了不得不承认 基于解剖学上的人的民主 也许正在崩溃的时候
"I don't want to give up the science,  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes  like the science is coming out from under us.",我不想对科学失去希望 但是同时，有的时候隐约觉得 科学的发展是受到我们影响的
So where do we go?,因此我们将走向何方？
"It seems like what happens in our culture  is a sort of pragmatic attitude:  ""Well, we have to draw the line somewhere,  so we will draw the line somewhere.""",看起来我们的社会 有着一种实用主义的态度： “好，我必须在某处画一条界限， 那么我就在那画一条界限”
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.,但是很多人会因此陷在一个非常尴尬的位置
"So for example,  Texas has at one point decided  that what it means to marry a man  is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.",举个例子 德克萨斯州有一个决定 嫁给一个男人 意味着你没有Y染色体 同时如果你娶一个女人意味着你有Y染色体
Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes.,现实中，他们实际上不会去检测染色体
"But this is also very bizarre,  because of the story I told you at the beginning  about androgen insensitivity syndrome.",但是这也非常奇怪 因为我一开始告诉了大家那个关于 雄激素不敏感综合征的故事
"If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy,  Dr. Martin Luther King,  he offers us something of a solution in his ""I have a dream"" speech.",如有我们看一下现代民主制度的奠基人之一 马丁·路德·金 博士 在他的“我有一个梦想”的演讲中，为我们提供了一个解决方法
"He says we should judge people ""based not on the color of their skin,  but on the content of their character,""  moving beyond anatomy.",他认为我们“不应该根据一个人的肤色 而是应该根据他的品格”去评判一个人 摒弃人种差异
"And I want to say, ""Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea.""",我想说“是的，那听起来确实是个好方法”
"But in practice, how do you do it?",但实际操作中，你怎么去做？
How do you judge people based on the content of character?,你如何根据他的品德去评判他？
"I also want to point out  that I'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans,  because, I have to admit, that there are some golden retrievers I know  that are probably more deserving of social services  than some humans I know.",我还想指出 我不太确定我们应该如何分配人类的权利 因为，我不得不承认，有些黄金猎犬 比起我知道的一些人似乎更应该 得到社会的帮助
"I also want to say there are probably also some yellow Labradors that I know  that are more capable of informed, intelligent, mature decisions  about sexual relations than some 40-year-olds that I know.",我还想说，我知道有些拉布拉多似乎 比有些40岁左右的人在性关系问题上 更慎重，更聪明，更能作出成熟的决定
So how do we operationalize  the question of content of character?,因此我们如何去衡量 品德的问题？
It turns out to be really difficult.,结果证明是非常困难的
"And part of me also wonders,  what if content of character  turns out to be something that's scannable in the future --  able to be seen with an fMRI?",我还想知道 如果品德的好坏 在未来可以被扫描出来—— 也许可以用核磁共振成像看见？
Do we really want to go there?,我们真的愿意走到那一步吗？
I'm not sure where we go.,我不确定我们将走向何方
What I do know is that it seems to be really important  to think about the idea of the United States being in the lead  of thinking about this issue of democracy.,我知道的是应该思考一下 美国所引领的民主存在的问题 看起来是非常重要的
"We've done a really good job struggling with democracy,  and I think we would do a good job in the future.",我们在争取民主的问题上已经做得非常好了 我认为今后同样会做的更好
"We don't have a situation that Iran has, for example,  where a man who's sexually attracted to other men  is liable to be murdered,  unless he's willing to submit to a sex change,  in which case he's allowed to live.",我们情况和伊朗不同，比如 一个男人在性方面对其他男人有吸引力 那么他是可以被杀的 除非他愿意改变自己的性取向 那么他将可以活下来
We don't have that kind of situation.,我们没有那样的情况
"I'm glad to say we don't have the kind of situation with --  a surgeon I talked to a few years ago  who had brought over a set of conjoined twins  in order to separate them, partly to make a name for himself.",我非常高兴的说我们没有那样的情况-- 对一位外科医生说，那是在数年之前 他带来一个连体婴儿 希望可以帮助他们分离，某种程度上也想让自己出名
"But when I was on the phone with him,  asking why he was going to do this surgery --  this was a very high-risk surgery --  his answer was that, in this other nation,  these children were going to be treated very badly, and so he had to do this.",但是当我跟他通电话时 问他为什么希望做这个手术—— 因为这是个危险性很高的手术—— 他答道，在这个国家 这样的孩子将会被残忍的对待，因此他必须要帮助他们这么做
"My response to him was, ""Well, have you considered political asylum  instead of a separation surgery?""",我对他的回答是，“恩，你为他们考虑过政治避难 而不是进行手术吗？”
"The United States has offered tremendous possibility  for allowing people to be the way they are,  without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state.",美国为像这样的孩子保持他们自己的特征 提供了很大的可能 他们从不用为了国家改变自己的身体
So I think we have to be in the lead.,因此我认为我们应该要引领这种思想
"Well, just to close, I want to suggest to you  that I've been talking a lot about the fathers.",好，说到这里，我想提醒大家 我已经谈论了很多前人的事情
"And I want to think about the possibilities  of what democracy might look like, or might have looked like,  if we had more involved the mothers.",我还想考虑一下 民主会是什么样子，或者是已经是什么样子的可能性 如果我们可以让更多的母亲参与进来
"And I want to say something a little bit radical for a feminist,  and that is that I think that there may be  different kinds of insights  that can come from different kinds of anatomies,  particularly when we have people thinking in groups.",我还想说对女权主义者有点激进的话 那就是我认为 不同的人 也许可以带来不同的的观察视角 特别是当我们习惯于群体性思维的时候
"Now for years, because I've been interested in intersex,  I've also been interested in sex difference research.",我已经对双性人感兴趣很多年了 也对性别差异也进行了多年的研究
And one of the things that I've been really interested in  is looking at the differences between males and females  in terms of the way they think and operate in the world.,我十分感兴趣的事情之一是 去观察世界范围内男性与女性之间 在思考问题和解决问题上的差别
"And what we know from cross-cultural studies  is that females, on average --  not everyone, but on average --  are more inclined to be very attentive  to complex social relations  and to taking care of people  who are basically vulnerable within the group.",我们从跨文化研究中得知 女性，平均的看—— 当然不是每个人，而是平均的看—— 更倾向于留意 复杂的社会关系 同时更加关心、同情 人群中的弱势群体
"And so if we think about that,  we have an interesting situation on our hands.",那么如果我们这么认为 我们发现一个有趣的情况
"Years ago, when I was in graduate school,  one of my graduate advisers who knew I was interested in feminism --  I considered myself a feminist, as I still do --  asked a really strange question.",数年前，当我读研究生的时候 我的一位指导教授知道我对女权运动很感兴趣—— 我自认是女权主义者，一直是—— 他问了我一个很怪的问题
"He said, ""Tell me what's feminine about feminism.""",他说：“告诉我女权主义女性化在哪里”
"And I thought, ""Well that's the dumbest question I've ever heard.",我想“恩……这是我听过的最让我哑口无言的问题
"Feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender,  so there's nothing feminine about feminism.""",女权主义是所有消除陈腐性别观念的一切活动的统称， 因此，女权主义不存在女性化”
"But the more I thought about his question,  the more I thought there might be something feminine about feminism.",但是，进一步解读这个问题， 我想的更多的是，也许女权主义存在着一些女性化
"That is to say, there might be something, on average,  different about female brains from male brains  that makes us more attentive  to deeply complex social relationships  and more attentive to taking care of the vulnerable.",也就是说，也许有一些，总的说来 女性的思维不同于男性的部分 使得我们更加富有警惕性 对于复杂的社会关系 并且更加注意关心那些弱势群体
"So whereas the fathers were extremely attentive  to figuring out how to protect individuals from the state,  it's possible that if we injected more mothers  into this concept,  what we would have is more of a concept  of, not just how to protect,  but how to care for each other.",但是前人们细心的 指出如何保护个人不受国家的影响 如果我们在这个概念中注入如更多的母性 是可能的 我们将拥有的要远多于一个概念 不仅仅是如何保护 而是如何照顾彼此
"And maybe that's where we need to go in the future,  when we take democracy beyond anatomy,  is to think less about the individual body,  in terms of the identity,  and think more about those relationships.",也许这就是我们未来要走的路 当我们抛开人种的分别来讲民主—— 也就是较少的考虑到人的个体 关于人的身份特性， 而是更多的考虑人们之间的关系
"So that as we the people try to create a more perfect union,  we're thinking about what we do for each other.",因此，当人们试图创造一个更加美好的联合体的时候 我们需要考虑的是我们为他人都做了什么
Thank you.,谢谢
"In 2007,  I decided that we needed to reconceptualize  how we thought about economic development.",2007年 我觉得我们需要重新定义 我们意识中的经济发展的概念。
"Our new goal should be  that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work,  they should be able to choose between  at least a handful  of different cities  that were all competing to attract new residents.",我们新目标应该致力于 当每个家庭考虑他们想住和工作的地方的时候 他们能有至少5个 不同的 可以选择 有竞争力吸引新住户的城市。
Now we're a long way away from that goal right now.,对于这个目标我们还有很长的路要走。
There are billions of people in developing countries  who don't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them.,在发展中国家有几十亿的人 处于没有一个城市愿意接纳他们的阶段。
But the amazing thing about cities  is they're worth so much more  than it costs to build them.,但是城市的惊人之处在于 它的利用价值 要比建造消耗价值要多的多。
"So we could easily supply the world  with dozens, maybe hundreds,  of new cities.",所以我们能很轻松的为世界 建造几十，或者上百的 新城。
Now this might sound preposterous to you  if you've never thought about new cities.,你可能觉得这听起来很荒谬 如果你从来没有考虑过新城。
But just substitute apartment building for cities.,但是这只是替代城市的住宅建筑而已。
Imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them;  the other half aren't there yet.,想象下半数的想住在公寓的人已经入住了； 另外半数还没有入住。
You could try and expand the capacity  by doing additions on all the existing apartments.,你可以加盖已有的住宅 来试着扩大面积。
But you know what you'd run into  is those apartments and the surrounding areas  have rules to avoid discomfort  and the distractions of construction.,但是你知道你经手的 住宅和周边地块 是受法律保护保证其舒适性的 和娱乐性的建筑。
So it's extremely hard to do all of those additions.,做这些加盖是十分的困难的。
"But you could go out someplace brand new,  build a brand new apartment building,  as long as the rules there  were ones that facilitated construction  rather than getting in the way.",但是你能在未开发的地区 建设一幢新的大楼， 就像俗话说的 重新开始强过 停滞不前。
So I proposed  that governments create new reform zones  big enough to hold cities  and gave them a name: charter cities.,所以我提议 政府划定新的足够容纳 城市的地域 并起名为：宪章城市。
"Later I learned that at about this same time,  Javier and Octavio  were thinking about the challenge of reform  in Honduras.",大约我了解这些的同时， 哈维尔和奥克塔维奥 正在思考在洪都拉斯重新规划的 问题。
"They knew that about 75,000 Hondurans every year  would leave to go to the United States,  and they wanted to ask, what could they do  to make sure that those people could stay  and do the same things in Honduras.",据说大约每年7万5千洪都拉斯人 移民到美国 他们想问，他们能做什么 来确保能让这些人留下来 在洪都拉斯做同样的工作，生活下来。
"At one point, Javier said to Octavio,  ""What if we took some of our empty land --  what if we just gave it to an embassy --  give some to the U.S. embassy; give some to the Canadian embassy --  and then if people want to go work  under the rules of Canada or under the rules of the United States,  they can go get jobs,  do everything they do on those embassy grounds",有一次，哈维尔对奥克塔维奥说 “如果我们把我们闲置的土地-- 如果我们把它送给大使馆会怎么样-- 一些给美国大使馆；一些给加拿大大使馆-- 届时如果想在 加拿大或者美国规则下本土找工作的话 他们就能找到工作， 在这些大使馆本土地区做工作
"that they would otherwise have to go to Canada or the U.S. to do?""",否则就得去加拿大或美国找工作？”
"In the summer of 2009,  Honduras went through a wrenching constitutional crisis.",2009年夏天 洪都拉斯经历了一次铁血的军事政变。
"At the next regularly scheduled election,  Pepe Lobo won in a landslide  on a platform that promised reform,  but reconciliation as well.",在下一届例行选举中 佩佩·洛沃凭借选举演讲 上许诺改革以及和谈 赢得了压倒性的优势。
He asked Octavio to be his chief of staff.,他邀请奥克塔维奥作为他的参谋长。
"Meanwhile, I was getting ready  to give a talk at TEDGlobal.",同时，我在准备一个 TEDGlobal上的演讲。
"Through a process of refinement,  trial and error, a lot of user testing,  I tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city  down to the bare essentials.",通过一系列的改良 试错，大量用户的测试 我试着把这宪章城市复杂的概念 压缩成最基本的精华。
"The first point was the importance of rules,  like those rules that say  you can't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders.",第一点是法令的重要性， 就像法令所说的 你不能骚扰已经入住的住户一样。
"We pay a lot of attention to new technologies,  but it takes technologies and rules to get progress,  and it's usually the rules that hold us back.",我们关注新的科技 但是新科技需要技术和要求来执行。 通常是这些要求拖我们的后腿。
"In the fall of 2010, a friend from Guatemala  sent Octavio a link to the TEDTalk.",在2010年秋，一个危地马拉的朋友 发给奥克塔维奥这个TEDTalk的链接。
He showed it to Javier.,他把它展示给哈维尔
They called me.,他们打给我电话
"They said, ""Let's present this to the leaders of our country.""",说，“让我们把这个展示给我们总统吧。”
"So in December we met in Miami,  in a hotel conference room.",12月我们就在迈阿密 在一个宾馆的会议室碰了面。
"I tried to explain this point  about how valuable cities are,  how much more valuable they are than they cost.",我试着解释这些城市 的价值所在 以及相比它的消耗它的价值会有多少。
"And I used this slide  showing how valuable the raw land is  in a place like New York City:  notice, land that's worth thousands of dollars, in some cases,  per square meter.",我用这张幻灯片 展示了像纽约这块地区 一块未开发地块的价值。 注意，在某些点，地价要 每平方米几千美金。
"But it was a fairly abstract discussion,  and at some point when there was a pause,  Octavio said,  ""Paul, maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.""",但是这是一个大致的抽象的讨论 当某些间隙的时候 奥克塔维奥说， “保罗，也许我们可以观看TEDTalk。”
"So the TEDTalk laid out in very simple terms,  a charter city is a place  where you start with uninhabited land,  a charter that specifies the rules that will apply there  and then a chance for people to opt in,  to go live under those rules or not.",TEDTalk用简单的方式就讲明了 宪章城市是一个 起始于无人居住的地域， 宪章细化了执行的条例 也是人们选择是否入住 是否生活在这些条例下的一个机会。
"So I was asked by the president of Honduras  who said that we need to do this project,  this is important,  this could be the way forward for our country.",洪都拉斯总统向我提问 那个表态说我们需要这个项目的人 这是关键 这会是引领我们国家前进的道路。
I was asked to come to Tegucigalpa  and talk again on January fourth and fifth.,我被邀请造访特古西加尔巴 在1月4日，5日重述此项目。
"So I presented  another fact-filled lecture that included a slide like this,  which tried to make the point that, if you want to create a lot of value in a city,  it has to be very big.",我展示了 另外一个包括了这张幻灯片 的案例课 试着讲述这个观点，如果你想在城市创造巨大价值的话 它必须也是很巨大的。
"This is a picture of Denver,  and the outline is the new airport that was built in Denver.",这是丹佛市的照片 高亮出的是丹佛新建的机场。
This airport alone  covers more than 100 square kilometers.,单这机场 就占地超过100平方千米。
"So I was trying to persuade the Hondurans,  if you build a new city,  you've got to start with a site that's at least 1,000 square kilometers.",我试着说服洪都拉斯总统 如果你要建一座新城 你就要在至少1000平方千米的区域入手。
That's more than 250 hundred-thousand acres.,这要比2500万英亩还大。
Everybody applauded politely.,每个人都很有礼貌地鼓着掌。
The faces in the audience  were very serious and attentive.,观众的表情 都是严肃而警惕的。
"The leader of the congress came up on stage and said,  ""Professor Romer, thank you very much for your lecture,  but maybe we could watch the TEDTalk.",大会主席走到台前说 “罗摩教授，很感谢你的讲课 但也许我们能看看TEDTalk。
"I've got it here on my laptop.""",我笔记本上现在就有。”
"So I sat down, and they played the TEDTalk.",于是我坐下，他们则看起了TEDTalk。
"And it got to the essence,  which is that a new city could offer new choices for people.",它同时也抓住了精髓 就是新的城市带给了人们新的选择。
"There would be a choice of a city which you could go to  which could be in Honduras,  instead of hundreds of miles away in the North.",这是一个你会前往城市的选择 也许在洪都拉斯 而不是几百公里远的北方。
And it also involved new choices for leaders.,它也给了领导者新的选择。
"Because the leaders in the government there in Honduras  would need help from partner countries,  who could benefit from partner countries  who help them set up the rules in this charter and the enforcement,  so everybody can trust  that the charter really will be enforced.",因为洪都拉斯政府的领导 需要友国的帮助 那些从友国中获得利益 那些帮助他们设定并实行宪章中的条例 来让每个人都会相信 宪章实际上会得到实行。
And the insight of President Lobo  was that that assurance of enforcement  that I was thinking about  as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city  could be equally important for all the different parties in Honduras  who had suffered for so many years  from fear and distrust.,总统洛沃的领悟 就是对实行能力的保证 我认为 作为一个吸引外商投资建造的城市的方法 应该和洪都拉斯经历了多年 恐惧和怀疑的不同党派 一样的重要。
We went and looked at a site.,我们实地考察了那块地区。
This picture's from there.,这是那里的一张照片。
It easily could hold a thousand square kilometers.,这能轻易容纳一千平方千米。
"And shortly thereafter, on January 19th,  they voted in the congress to amend their constitution  to have a constitutional provision  that allows for special development regions.",之后不久，1月19日 他们在国会中投票修改了宪法 来提供一个法律的支持 来许可特定的发展地区。
"In a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis,  the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment  was 124 to one.",在刚经历过政变的这个国家 国会上赞成宪法修正案的票数 是124比1。
"All parties, all factions in society, backed this.",社会上派系，所有党派都支持这修正案。
"To be part of the constitution, you actually have to pass it twice in the congress.",作为宪法的一部分，你实际需要在国会上通过两次。
On February 17th they passed it again  with another vote of 114 to one.,在2月17日他们以114比1 再次通过了法案。
"Immediately after that vote,  on February 21st to the 24th,  a delegation of about 30 Hondurans  went to the two places in the world  that are most interested in getting into the city building business.",立刻在投票之后 2月21到24日 大约30个人的洪都拉斯代表团 来到了世上 两个建筑业最感兴趣的两个地方。
One is South Korea.,一个是韩国。
"This is a picture of a big, new city center  that's being built in South Korea --  bigger than downtown Boston.",这是一张韩国将建成的 大型的，新市中心-- 比波士顿商业区还大。
"Everything you see there was built in four years,  after they spent four years getting the permits.",所有你看到的刚建设了4年 但他们得到许可来建设就花费了4年。
The other place that's very interested in city building is Singapore.,另外一个吸引建筑业的是新加坡。
They've actually built two cities already in China  and are preparing the third.,他们实际上已经在中国建设了两个新城 并准备建第三个。
"So if you think about this practically,  here's where we are.",如果你理性地考虑这个的话 这就是我们当下处境。
They've got a site; they're already thinking about this site for the second city.,他们有了地块，并已经考虑把它建设成第二城市。
"They're putting in place a legal system  that could allow for managers to come in,  and also an external legal system.",他们正步入一个法定的程序 来允许管理人员介入 同时也有个外加的法律系统。
One country has already volunteered to let its supreme court  be the court of final appeal for the new judicial system there.,一个国家已经自愿让最高法院 为了这新的司法体系而成为最终上诉申请的法院。
There's designers and builders of cities  They even can bring with them some financing.,这是对其感兴趣的 城市设计师和建筑师而言。 这些甚至能带给他们一些经济支持。
But the one thing you know they've already solved  is that there's lots of tenants.,但是有一件你了解的早被解决的事 是有很多的佃户。
"There's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the Americas,  especially in a place with a free trade zone,  and there's lots of people who'd like to go there.",有很多商家意向进驻美国 特别进驻到自由交易区 也有很多人想去那里。
"Around the world, there's 700 million people  who say they'd like to move permanently someplace else right now.",全世界，有7亿人 想立刻永久的移民到某些其他地方。
There's a million a year  who leave Latin America to go to the United States.,每年100万人 从拉丁美洲前往美国。
Many of these are a father  who has to leave his family behind to go get a job --  sometimes a single mother  who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing.,其中很多是远离 家庭的来寻找工作的父亲-- 有时是单亲妈妈 来赚钱为了衣食生计。
"Sadly, sometimes there are even children  who are trying to get reunited with their parents  that they haven't seen, in some cases, for a decade.",可悲的是，有时甚至是孩子 尝试着为了和很久未见的父母 有些时候，数十年，他们才团聚。
So what kind of an idea is it  to think about building a brand new city in Honduras?,这是个怎么样的愿景 来考虑在洪都拉斯建立一个新城？
"Or to build a dozen of these,  or a hundred of these, around the world?",或者建立十几个新城 或者全世界建立几百个新城？
What kind of an idea is it  to think about insisting  that every family have a choice of several cities  that are competing to attract new residents?,这又是个怎么样的愿景 来考虑坚持 每个家庭都有数个具有竞争力吸引新住户 的城市的选择？

"This is a representation of your brain,  and your brain can be broken into two parts.",这是大脑的描绘图。 你的大脑可以被分为两个部分。
"There's the left half, which is the logical side,  and then the right half,  which is the intuitive.",左脑，主要负责理性方面， 而右脑， 主要负责直觉。
"And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,  then we can plot our brain.",如果我们用刻度线来测量脑半球的能力的话， 并标记我们的大脑。
"And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.",比如说，这表示某人完全的理性。
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.,这就表示着某人完全的感性。
So where would you put your brain on this scale?,那你会把你的大脑放在线上的哪里呢？
"Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,  but I think for most people in the audience,  your brain is something like this --  with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.",一些人可能会选这极端情况的一种， 但是我觉得大多数听众， 你的大脑位置应该大致像这样-- 两个脑半球同时有着很高的潜力。
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.,它们不太可能会互相的排斥或其他什么的。
You can be logical and intuitive.,你可以既理性又感性。
"And so I consider myself one of these people,  along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,  who need a good deal of logic  to string together these complex ideas.",我自认为是一个 和大多数其他的实验量子物理学家一样， 有着很好的逻辑思维 能把那些复杂的想法串连起来。
"But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition  to actually make the experiments work.",但是同时，我们也需要一个好的直觉 让实验能切实的进行下去。
How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.,那我们如何来提高这种直觉力呢？嗯我们喜欢研究东西。
"So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,  and then we develop our intuition from there.",我们本身研究和捣鼓东西，然后我们会看它怎么反应。 接着我们从中提升我们的直觉力。
And really you do the same thing.,实际上你也做同样的事情。
So some intuition  that you may have developed over the years  is that one thing is only in one place at a time.,有一些你可能 培养了很多年了的直觉 像一个事物只能同时出现在一个方位。
"I mean, it can sound weird to think about  one thing being in two different places at the same time,  but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.",我的意思是，这会很奇怪，要你去考虑一个事物可以 同时出现在两个不同的地方， 但是你不是天生就有这种概念，你是后天培养的。
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.,我记得看到过一个小孩在阻车器上玩。
"He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.",他还只是个学步而且并不擅长这个的小孩，他就一直摔倒。
"But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,  and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,  and that they stay in one place.",但是我打赌和阻车器玩耍给他上了很有价值的一课， 就是大型的物体不会让你轻易的穿过， 而且它们停留在一个地方。
"And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,  unless you're a particle physicist.",这是世上拥有的一个很具备概念性的模型， 除非你是粒子物理学家。
"It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,  because they don't play with car stops,  they play with these little weird particles.",对于粒子物理学家这也会是一个很糟糕的模型， 因为他们不研究阻车器， 他们研究那些很小的奇怪的微粒。
"And when they play with their particles,  they find they do all sorts of really weird things --  like they can fly right through walls,  or they can be in two different places at the same time.",当他们研究他们的微粒的时候， 他们觉得他们在做各种真正奇怪的事情-- 好像他们能穿墙， 或者他们能同时出现在两个地方。
"And so they wrote down all these observations,  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.",他们记录下这些发现的时候， 他们以此起名为量子力学理论。
"And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;  you needed quantum mechanics  to describe little, tiny particles.",这就是几年前物理学的前沿； 你需要量子力学 来描述细小，微小的粒子。
"But you didn't need it  to describe the large, everyday objects around us.",但是你不需要它 来描述那些巨大的，周围日常的物体。
"This didn't really sit well with my intuition,  and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.",这并不很符合我的直觉认知， 也许是因为我不太时常研究微粒的缘故吧。
"Well, I play with them sometimes,  but not very often.",嗯，我还是有时候研究它们的， 只是不太平常而已。
And I've never seen them.,而且我也从来没有看到过它们。
"I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.",我指，没人能看见微粒。
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.,但是这也不符合我的逻辑认知。
"Because if everything is made up of little particles  and all the little particles  follow quantum mechanics,  then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?",因为如果所有事物都是由微粒组成的 而每个微粒 都遵循量子力学理论的话， 那所有事物不也应该遵循量子力学理论吗？
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.,我找不到为什么它不遵循的原因。
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing  if we could somehow show  that an everyday object  also follows quantum mechanics.,所以我对于整件事情会了解的更好 如果我们用某种方式来表明 日常的每件事物 也都遵循量子力学理论。
"So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.",不久之前，我开始着手。
So I made one.,我制造出了这个。
This is the first object  that you can see  that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.,这是第一个你能看的见 同时也是 量子力学叠加的产物。
So what we're looking at here  is a tiny computer chip.,这里我们看到的 是一个电脑微型芯片。
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.,在中间你大概能看到的那个绿点。
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.,那就是我接下去要讲的金属。
This is a photograph of the object.,这是它的照片。
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.,聚焦一点。我们看到正中心的那点。
"And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.",这则是一个很近，很近距离观测到的金属片。
"So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,  and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.",我们看到的是一小块金属， 它的外形像一个跳水板，并且它伸出了一端。
And so I made this thing  in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.,我用几乎和制造电脑芯片 同样的方法制造出这金属。
"I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,  and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.",我在无菌室操作一片硅晶片， 接着我周转于所有这些大型机器中大约100个小时。
"For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --  to make this swimming pool-shaped hole  underneath the device.",为了最后的结果，我不得不制造自己的机器-- 让这泳池型的洞 在设备的下方。
"This device has the ability  to be in a quantum superposition,  but it needs a little help to do it.",这个设备有能力 来进行量子叠加， 但是它需要些帮助来完成这步骤。
"Here, let me give you an analogy.",来，让我给你打个比方。
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?,你知道在一个拥挤的电梯里是多么不舒服吗？
"I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,  but then other people get on board  and I stop doing those things  because I don't want to bother them,  or, frankly, scare them.",我指，当我一个人在电梯里，我能做各种奇怪的事情， 但是当其他人进来的时候 我就停止做这些事， 因为我不想打扰到其他人， 或者，实话说，吓到其他人。
So quantum mechanics says  that inanimate objects feel the same way.,所以量子力学表明 非生命体也变现出同样的情况。
"The fellow passengers for inanimate objects  are not just people,  but it's also the light shining on it  and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.",那些非生命体的乘客 不仅仅是人， 但是它还包括照射它的光 吹拂过它的风和空间内的热度。
"And so we knew, if we wanted to see  this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,  we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.",所以，如果我们想目睹 这片金属表现出量子力学的特性， 我们就不得不剔除所有其他的乘客。
And so that's what we did.,这就是我们曾做的。
"We turned off the lights,  and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,  and then we cooled it down  to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.",我们关闭灯光， 接着我们把它放入抽真空机中并抽出所有的空气， 接着我们将它冷却 到绝对零度以上一点点。
"Now, all alone in the elevator,  the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.",现在，在电梯里， 小金属片可以做任何它想做的事。
And so we measured its motion.,我们测量了它的运动。
We found it was moving in really weird ways.,我们发现它用很古怪的方式在运动。
"Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,  and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --  like expanding and contracting bellows.",它是在震动，而不是完全的静止。 它震动的方式是像这种-- 像一张一合的风箱。
"And by giving it a gentle nudge,  we were able to make it both vibrate  and not vibrate  at the same time --  something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.",只要给它一个轻微的撞击， 我们就能让它震动 的同时 也不震动-- 某些只在量子力学范围下才会发生的事。
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.,我在这里告诉大家的是一些很奇妙的事情。
What does it mean for one thing  to be both vibrating and not vibrating  at the same time?,一个事物震动的 同时也不震动 这是什么意思？
So let's think about the atoms.,让我们考虑下原子。
So in one case:  all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal  are sitting still  and at the same time those same atoms  are moving up and down.,一个例子： 所有万亿个形成金属片的原子 正保持静止 同时同样的这些原子 正在上下移动。
Now it's only at precise times when they align.,只有在特定精确时间，它们是一致的。
The rest of the time they're delocalized.,余下的时间它们则是不定域的。
"That means that every atom  is in two different places at the same time,  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal  is in two different places.",这意味着每个原子 在同一时间在两个不同的地方， 进一步说明整个金属片 在两个位置。
I think this is really cool.,我认为这个真的很酷。
Really.,真的。
"It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years  because, check this out,  the difference in scale  between a single atom and that chunk of metal  between that chunk of metal and you.",我这些年把自己锁在无菌室所做的事都是很值得的。 因为，看这个， 单个原子 和金属片的比例差 大约和整片金属片和你这个个体的 比例差是一样的。
"So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,  that chunk of metal can be in two different places,  then why not you?",所以如果单个原子能同时处于不同的两个位置， 那金属片也能处于不同的两个位置， 那么为什么你不能呢？
"I mean, this is just my logical side talking.",我指的，这只是我的理性思考的逻辑。
"So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,  what would that be like?",那想想如果你能同时处于多个位置， 那会是什么样子的？
How would your consciousness  handle your body being delocalized in space?,你的认知将如何处理 你自身在空间中的不定域问题呢？
There's one more part to the story.,这是故事的一个部分。
"It's when we warmed it up,  and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,  we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.",当我们把它加热， 并打开灯光观察盒子里面的时候， 我们看到金属片依旧只是一块。
"And so I had to develop this new intuition,  that it seems like all the objects in the elevator  are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space.",所以我不得不形成一个新的直觉， 似乎所有电梯中的物体 实际上都被塞进一个极小空间中的
You hear a lot of talk  about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.,量子物体。 大家听过很多 关于量子物理学如何解释万物是互相联系的。
"Well, that's not quite right.",嗯，这不是完全正确的；
It's more than that; it's deeper.,它要比这个更广泛，更深奥。
"It's that those connections,  your connections to all the things around you,  literally define who you are,  and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.",正是这些联系， 你和你周边的这些联系， 真正的定义了你是谁。 这才是量子力学的深奥和不可思议。
Thank you.,谢谢

"Now today, if you want to win the race,  actually you need also something like this --  something that monitors the car in real time,  has a few thousand sensors  collecting information from the car,  transmitting this information into the system,  and then processing it  and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions  and changing things in real time  as information is collected.",现如今，如果你想夺冠， 事实上你还需要其他一些东西比如这个-- 一些能实时检测赛车的装备 它连接着上千感应器 能把收集到的车的相关数据， 传输进系统中， 并处理 并用这个来反馈决定给车本身 使其实时地改变 做到与信息收集同步。
"This is what, in engineering terms,  you would call a real time control system.",这就是，用工程师的说法， 叫做实时监控系统。
"And basically, it's a system made of two components --  a sensing and an actuating component.",基本上，这个系统包括两个部件 一个是感应器一个是驱动器
What is interesting today  is that real time control systems  are starting to enter into our lives.,如今，有趣的是 这个实时监控系统 正开始渗透到我们的生活中。
"Our cities, over the past few years,  just have been blanketed  with networks, electronics.",我们的城市，在过去的几年中， 已经被网络，电子工业 所覆盖。
They're becoming like computers in open air.,它 们变得好像无线收放电脑。
"And, as computers in open air,  they're starting to respond in a different way  to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.",同时，作为无线收放的电脑， 它们开始做出不同的回应 能传感和制动。
"If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.",如果我们能优化城市，实际上这是个飞跃。
"Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,  cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,  but they are 50 percent of the world's population.",说句题外话，我想说， 城市只占了地球表面的百分之2， 但是它们却占据了世界人口的百分之50。
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --  up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.,它们的能源消耗占世界的百分之75-- 产生百分之80的二氧化碳排放量。
"So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.",所以如果我们优化城市，那将会是个飞越。
"Beyond cities,  all of this sensing and actuating  is entering our everyday objects.",在这些城市之上， 所有这些传感和制动 正在进入我们每天的日常事物中。
"That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing  at MoMA later this year, during the summer.",这是今年夏天柏拉·安东内利 在纽约现代艺术博物馆 组织的一次展览。
"It's called ""Talk to Me.""",主题为“与我交谈。”
"Well our objects, our environment  is starting to talk back to us.",我们的事物，我们的环境， 正在开始给我们反馈。
"In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there  were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.",某种意义上，就像每个原子 都在变成传感器和制动器。
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans  with the environment out there.,同时这也根本上改变了我们作为人类 和大自然之间的关系。
"In a certain sense,  it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...",某种意义上， 这简直就是米开朗琪罗古老的梦想...

Why don't you talk?""",你知道，当米开朗琪罗雕刻摩西像时， 在最后他拿起铁锤，扔向摩西像-- 事实上你还看到底下那小的凹槽-- 说着，咆哮着， “你为什不说话，为什么？”
"Well today, for the first time,  our environment is starting to talk back to us.",今天，第一次， 我们的环境开始给我们反馈。
"And I'll show just a few examples --  again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.",我将展示几个案例-- 有一次，随着我们的意识去感应并回应我们环境。

"It started with a question by the mayor of the city,  who came to us saying  that Spain and Southern Europe have a beautiful tradition  of using water in public space, in architecture.",它开始于市长提出的一个问题， 他找到我们说 西班牙以至于欧洲南部 用建筑，在公共场合善用水资源的传统。
"And the question was: How could technology, new technology,  be added to that?",问题就是：技术，新的技术，怎么样才能 使其锦上添花？
"And one of the ideas that was developed at MIT in a workshop  was, imagine this pipe, and you've got valves,  solenoid valves, taps,  opening and closing.",其中一个点子是来自麻省理工的一个研发组 是关于，想象一个管道，你有它的阀门， 电磁阀，读数表， 开启又关闭。

The roof also is covered with water.,屋顶同样也是被水覆盖着。
"And if there's a bit of wind,  if you want to minimize splashing, you can actually lower the roof.",如果有一点风的话， 如果你想少一点水溅出的话，你事实上可以把屋顶降低一些。
"Or you could close the building,  and the whole architecture will disappear,  like in this case.",或者甚至关闭整座大楼， 那这个建筑就会消失， 就好像这个样子。
"You know, these days, you always get images during the winter,  when they take the roof down,  of people who have been there and said, ""They demolished the building.""",这些天，你会在冬天常常能看这样的景象 当他们降低屋顶 去过那里的人就会说，“他们在拆除这建筑。”

"All the kids from Zaragoza came to the building,  because the way of engaging with the building became something different.",所有在萨拉戈萨的孩子云集此楼， 因为进入大楼的方式变的有些不同。
"Not anymore a building that would open up to let you in,  but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water,  and you had to jump without getting wet.",大楼不再会自动打开让你进入， 但是大楼还是会被水帘分割出不同的空间 那你就不能不跳过这次来不弄湿自己。
"And that was, for us, was very interesting,  because, as architects, as engineers, as designers,  we always think about how people will use the things we design.",同时，对于我们，这也很有意思， 因为，作为一个建筑师，一个工程师，一个设计师， 我们经常考虑人们如何使用我们设计出的东西。
But then reality's always unpredictable.,但是现实总是出人意料。

"Evolution has been a perennial topic  here at the TED Conference,  but I want to give you today  one doctor's take on the subject.",进化是个永久的话题了， 在TED的论坛上。 但是今天我要告诉你们 关于这个话题的一个医生的看法。
"The great 20th-century geneticist,  T.G. Dobzhansky,  who was also a communicant  in the Russian Orthodox Church,  once wrote an essay that he titled  ""Nothing in Biology Makes Sense  Except in the Light of Evolution.""",20世纪著名的遗传学家， T.杜布尚斯基， 同时他也是受圣餐的教徒， 在俄罗斯东正教教堂里。 他曾写过一篇文章，名为： “生物学的一切很难说通， 除非用进化的思想来思考。”
"Now if you are one of those  who does not accept the evidence for biological evolution,  this would be a very good time to turn off your hearing aid,  take out your personal communications device --  I give you permission --  and perhaps take another look at Kathryn Schultz's book on being wrong,  because nothing in the rest of this talk  is going to make any sense whatsoever to you.",现在，如果你是 不相信生物进化证据的 现在你可以关掉你的助听器的时候了， 拿出你的个人通讯设备了 -- 你得到允许了 -- 或者再看一次卡瑟林·舒尔茨（Kathryn Schulz)那本关于犯错的书。 因为接下来的演讲 你将感觉到没有任何意义。
"But if you do accept  biological evolution,  consider this:  is it just about the past,  or is it about the future?",可如果你相信 生物进化论， 想想一下这个： 那是关于过去的， 还是关于将来的？
"Does it apply to others,  or does it apply to us?",那是发生在其他生物身上的， 还是我们也会发生？
This is another look at the tree of life.,这是一张生命树的图。
"In this picture,  I've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions,  because if you look at the edges  of the tree of life,  every existing species  at the tips of those branches  has succeeded in evolutionary terms:  it has survived;  it has demonstrated a fitness  to its environment.",在这张图片里， 我让树状从中心向各个方向展开分支， 因为如果看生命树的 边角部分， 每个现有的物种 在那些分支尖端的， 用进化术语来说，都是成功的， 存活了。 这表明了一种适合度 对它的环境。
"The human part of this branch,  way out on one end,  is, of course, the one that we are most interested in.",人类的部分，在这个分支里， 在一个边角的末端， 当然是我们最感兴趣的。
We branch off of a common ancestor  to modern chimpanzees  about six or eight million years ago.,我们从一个共同祖先分支出来 和现代黑猩猩分开 大概是600万或800万年前。
"In the interval,  there have been perhaps 20 or 25  different species of hominids.",在这期间， 大概有20到25个 类人的物种。
Some have come and gone.,有些来过又走了。
"We have been here for about 130,000 years.",我们在这里生存了13万年。
"It may seem like we're quite remote  from other parts of this tree of life,  but actually, for the most part,  the basic machinery of our cells  is pretty much the same.",看起来，我们似乎 和这生命树的其他物种离得很远。 但事实上，在很多层面上， 组成我们细胞的基本的基本的构造 是几乎一样的。
Do you realize that we can take advantage  and commandeer the machinery of a common bacterium  to produce the protein of human insulin  used to treat diabetics?,你知道吗？我们可以利用 和应用一个普通细菌的构造 来制造人类胰岛素的蛋白质 而用来治疗糖尿病？
This is not like human insulin;  this is the same protein  that is chemically indistinguishable  from what comes out of your pancreas.,这并非人类的胰岛素； 这是一样的蛋白质 在生化角度上 和我们胰腺生成的很难区分。
"And speaking of bacteria,  do you realize that each of us carries in our gut  more bacteria  than there are cells in the rest of our body?",说到细菌， 你知道我们每人肚子里的细菌 多于 我们身体里的细胞？
Maybe 10 times more.,也许有10倍还要多。
"I mean think of it,  when Antonio Damasio asks about your self-image,  do you think about the bacteria?",大家想想， 当安东尼奥·达马西奥问你个人自我形象时， 你会想到细菌吗？
Our gut is a wonderfully hospitable environment  for those bacteria.,我们的肠子是一个很适宜的环境， 对那些细菌来说。
"It's warm, it's dark, it's moist,  it's very cozy.",温暖，黑暗，潮湿， 相当舒适。
And you're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want  with no effort on their part.,而且，我们还会提供给它们需要的几乎所有的养分 它们不费任何力气。
"It's really like an Easy Street for bacteria,  with the occasional interruption  of the unintended forced rush to the exit.",对细菌来说，这真是逍遥自在， 虽然有偶尔的打扰 被不情愿地排放出去。
"But otherwise,  you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria,  just as they are essential to your life.",但仍然， 对细菌来说，你是一个极好的生活环境， 而且他们对你的生活也是必需的。
"They help in the digestion of essential nutrients,  and they protect you against certain diseases.",他们帮助消化你所需的养分。 而且他们还保护你抵抗一些疾病。
But what will come in the future?,不过未来会是怎样呢？
Are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise  as a species?,我们是否已经处于进化上的平衡， 作为一个物种？
"Or, are we destined  to become something different --  something, perhaps, even better adapted  to the environment?",或者，我们的命运是 会变成其他不同的物种 —— 其他或许能更好地适应 环境？
"Now let's take a step back in time  to the Big Bang, 14 billion years ago --  the Earth, the solar system,  about four and a half billion years --  the first signs of proto-life,  maybe three to four billion years ago on Earth --  the first multi-celled organisms,  perhaps as much  as 800 or a billion years ago --  and then the human species,  finally emerging  in the last 130,000 years.",现在让我们回到 宇宙大爆炸的时候，140亿年前 — 地球，太阳系， 大概是45亿年前 — 原始生命的最初跡象， 可能三、四十亿年前的地球 — 第一个多细胞有机体， 大概是在 8亿或者10亿年前 — 然后是人类这一物种 终于出现在 最后的13万年。
"In this vast unfinished symphony of the universe,  life on Earth is like a brief measure;  the animal kingdom,  like a single measure;  and human life,  a small grace note.",在这宇宙的庞大的未完成的交响曲中， 地球上的生命就如一个简单的乐谱； 动物， 是单一的小节 而人类， 是一个装饰音。
That was us.,那就是我们。
"That also constitutes the entertainment portion of this talk,  so I hope you enjoyed it.",那也是这次演讲的有趣的部分， 我希望你们喜欢。
"Now when I was a freshman in college,  I took my first biology class.",在我还是大学新生的时候， 我上了我第一节生物学课。
I was fascinated  by the elegance and beauty of biology.,我很震惊， 生物学是优雅且美丽的。
"I became enamored of the power of evolution,  and I realized something very fundamental:  in most of the existence of life  in single-celled organisms,  each cell simply divides,  and all of the genetic energy of that cell  is carried on in both daughter cells.",我为进化的力量而着迷， 并意识到一个很基本的东西： 在大部分生命存在的形式中， 在单细胞生物体中， 每一个细胞的简单构造， 和所有该细胞的基因能量， 都被子细胞继承。
"But at the time multi-celled organisms come online,  things start to change.",不过在多细胞生物体出来的时候， 情况开始变化。
Sexual reproduction enters the picture.,有性生殖开始进入画面。
"And very importantly,  with the introduction of sexual reproduction  that passes on the genome,  the rest of the body  becomes expendable.",而且非常重要的是， 采用有性生殖的方式 而传递的基因， 而其他部分 变得可消耗。
"In fact, you could say  that the inevitability of the death of our bodies  enters in evolutionary time  at the same moment  as sexual reproduction.",实际上，你可以说 我们部分的死亡的必然性 出现在进化里 和有性繁殖 同时发生
"Now I have to confess,  when I was a college undergraduate,  I thought, okay, sex/death, sex/death, death for sex --  it seemed pretty reasonable at the time,  but with each passing year,  I've come to have increasing doubts.",如今我得说 当我还是大学生的时候 我当时想，好吧，性/死亡，性/死亡，为性而亡— 那时候听起来还是挺合理的， 但一年一年过去 我开始产生很多疑问。

"But there's a third possibility,  an enticing, intriguing and frightening possibility.",但是有第三种可能， 一种诱人的，有趣且骇人的可能性。
"I call it neo-evolution --  the new evolution  that is not simply natural,  but guided and chosen  by us as individuals  in the choices that we will make.",我把它叫做：新进化 — 一种新的进化方式 不是简单的自然界方式， 是有指导和选择的方式 由我们作为个体来 进行选择而促成的方式。

I have had the distinct blessing in my life  to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects.,我在生活中曾有幸 参与了许多令人惊叹的项目。
But the coolest I ever worked on  was around this guy.,但做过的最酷的项目 与这家伙有关。
This guy's name is TEMPT.,这家伙的名字是TEMPT。
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s.,TEMPT是八十年代最初的涂鸦艺术家之一。
"And he came up home from a run one day  and said, ""Dad, my legs are tingling.""",一天他跑完步回到家中 说道，“爸爸，我的腿有些发麻。”
And that was the onset of ALS.,这是ALS的初期症状。
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed.,TEMPT现在完全瘫痪了。
He only has use of his eyes.,只有他的眼睛能活动。
I was exposed to him.,我曾与他接触过。
"I have a company that does design and animation,  so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part  of what we admire and respect in the art world.",我有家做设计和动画的公司， 显然涂鸦是我们在艺术世界中 钦佩和尊敬的一个复杂的部分。
"And so we decided that we were going to sponsor  Tony, TEMPT, and his cause.",因此，我们决定成为 托尼，也就是TEMPT，事业的赞助者。
"So I went and met with his brother and father  and said, ""We're going to give you this money.",因此我去找到他兄弟和他父亲 对他们说，“我们打算给你们些钱。
"What are you going to do with it?""",你们会用来做什么？”
"And his brother said, ""I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.",他兄弟说道，“我只是想能够再和托尼聊天。
"I just want to be able to communicate with him  and him to be able to communicate with me.""",我只想能跟他交流 而且他也能跟我交流。”
"And I said, ""Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking --  don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate  via these devices?""",我说道，“等等，我曾见过斯蒂芬·霍金，” 不是所有瘫痪的人都能通过这些设备 和别人交流么？
"And he said, ""No, unless you're in the upper echelon and  you've got really amazing insurance,  you can't actually do that.",他回答道，“不，除非是上层社会的人，” 拥有十分惊人的保额， 不然根本做不到。
"These devices aren't accessible to people.""",这些设备不是那么容易得到的。”
"And I said, ""Well, how do you actually communicate?""",我说道，”好的，你们是怎么交流的？“
"Has everyone seen the movie ""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?""",大家有没有看过电影”潜水钟和蝴蝶“？
That's how they communicate --  so run their finger along.,那就是他们交流的方式 -- 移动他们的手指。
"I said, ""That's archaic. How can that be?""",我说道，”这法子太落后了。怎么会这样？“
"So I showed up with the desire to just write a check,  and instead, I wrote a check  that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash.",我出现时的心愿仅仅是开张支票， 相反，我开了张 我完全不知道如何兑现的支票。
"I committed to his brother and his father right then and there --  I'm like, ""All right, here's the deal:  Tony's going to speak, we're going to get him a machine,  and we're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again.",我当时向他兄弟和他父亲承诺 -- 大意是，“好的，这样吧： 托尼会能讲话的，我们会给他一台机器， 我们会找出一个能让他再次创作的方式。
"Because it's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him  isn't able to communicate it.""",因为一个人内在仍然正常却不能交流 实在是太荒唐了”
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.,几个月之后我在一次会议上有个演讲。
"I met these guys called GRL,  Graffiti Research Lab,  and they have a technology  that allows them to project a light onto any surface  and then, with a laser pointer, draw on it,  and it just registers the negative space.",我遇到了这些被称为GRL的家伙， 涂鸦研究实验室， 他们有一项技术 能让他们把一束光投射到任何表面上， 然后用一个激光笔在上面作画， 这会形成一种暗的间隙。
So they go around and do art installations like this.,他们就四处走动，像这样展示艺术。
"All the things that go up there, they said there's a life cycle.",所有这些事，他们称之为一个生命周期。
"First it starts with the sexual organs,  then it starts with cuss words,  then it was Bush slanders  and then people actually got to art.",首先以性器官开始， 然后是脏话， 接着是诽谤布什 然后人们就看到了艺术。
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations.,但是他们展示总是内涵了一个生命周期。
"So I went home and was having dinner with my wife  and was telling her about this,  and we were like, ""Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists  where you can use your eyes to control things,  why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser  and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome.""",我回到家中，与我妻子共进晚餐时 把这些告诉了她， 大意是，”等等，如果我们知道这项技术 能让你用眼睛控制事物， 为什么我们不想个办法让TEMPT来控制一束激光， 这一他就能再次进行涂鸦了，那就太棒了。“
So that started the journey.,因此我们开始行动。
"And about two years later, about a year later,  after a bunch of organization  and a bunch of moving things around,  we'd accomplished a couple things.",大约两年后，一年后， 在通过许多组织 和我们改变了一些情况 我们完成了一些事情
"One, we battered down the doors of the insurance companies,  and we actually got TEMPT a machine  that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine.",第一，我们捣毁了保险公司的大门， 我们真的给了TEMPT一台机器 让他能够进行交流 -- 一台斯蒂芬·霍金式的机器。
Which was awesome.,那太棒了。
"And he's seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda,  because you talk to the guy, you get an email from him,  and you're like, ""I'm not worthy. This guy's so amazing.""",他真的是最有趣的人 -- 我叫他尤达， 因为你跟他说话，他给你发Email， 你好象觉得，”我还不行。这家伙太出色了。“
The other thing we did  is we flew seven programmers from all over the world --  literally every corner of the world --  into our house.,我们做的另一件事是， 我们聚集了七名来自全世界的程序员 -- 毫不夸张，他们来自世界的每个角落 -- 把他们聚集到我们这儿。
"My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage,  and these hackers and programmers  and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house.",我妻子和孩子和我搬到了后面的车库里， 这些黑客、程序员、 阴谋论者和无政府主义者接管了我们的房子。
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that  and that we were going to come back  and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls.,我们许多朋友认为我们这么做真是太愚蠢了 等我们重回房子的时候 墙上挂的图片都会被拿下来，而且墙上会被画的乱七八糟。
"But for over two weeks,  we programmed,  we went to the Venice boardwalk,  my kids got involved,  my dog got involved,  and we created this.",但过了两个星期后， 我们进行了两星期后， 我们去了威尼斯街， 我的孩子也参与了， 我的狗也参与了， 我们造出了这个。
"This is called the EyeWriter,  and you can see the description.",我们称之为眼神书写器， 各位可以看看这个说明。
"This is a cheap pair of sunglasses  that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk,  some copper wire  and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack.",这是副便宜的太阳镜 我们在威尼斯海滨路买的， 一些铜线 和一些从家得宝和Radio Shack买的东西。
"We took a PS3 camera, hacked it open,  mounted it to an LED light,  and now there's a device that is free --  you build this yourself, we publish the code for free,  you download the software for free.",我们拿了个PS3的摄像头，拆解了它， 把它安装在一个LED灯上， 现在这个设备是免费的 -- 可以自己制作，我们把开放了源码， 你可以免费下载。
And now we've created a device  that has absolutely no limitations.,现在我们可以完全 不受限制地制作这一设备。
"There's no insurance company that can say ""No.""",没有任何保险公司能说“不”。
"There's no hospital that can say ""No.""",没有任何医院能说“不”。

Thank you.,谢谢。
Thank you guys very much. That was awesome.,非常感谢各位。这很棒。
"So at the end of the two weeks,  we went back to TEMPT's room.",在两个星期结束后， 我们回到了TEMPT的房间。
"I love this picture, because this is someone else's room  and that's his room.",我喜欢这张照片，因为这是别人的房间 这是他的房间。

"They wanted nothing to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control,  they would have no control over the final product.",他们不愿意与影片扯上关系，主要是因为他们没有控制权 他们无法控制最终成品
"But we did get 17 brand partners  who were willing to relinquish that control,  who wanted to be in business  with someone as mindful and as playful as myself  and who ultimately empowered us to tell stories  that normally we wouldn't be able to tell --  stories that an advertiser would normally never get behind.",但我们最终还是得到了17家合作公司 他们愿意交出控制权 他们愿意和像我这样 既有思想又玩世不恭的人合作 他们把讲述故事的权力完全交给了我们 讲述那些鲜为人知的故事－－ 那些广告商从未深入发掘的故事

"So ultimately,  this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum.",最后 这部电影已经收到了广泛的关注
And not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to  advised their clients not to take part.,对于这样一部影片而已，这是个不错的成绩 我们当时找的广告公司都建议客户不要参与
"What I always believe  is that if you take chances, if you take risks,  that in those risks will come opportunity.",我始终相信 如果你敢于尝试，敢于冒险 这些风险就会成为机遇
"I believe that when you push people away from that,  you're pushing them more towards failure.",我相信当你不让人们冒险 你就是在把他们推向失败

The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm  is actually quite simple.,震网电脑蠕虫背后的思想 其实非常简单。
We don't want Iran to get the bomb.,我们不希望伊朗拥有核武器。
Their major asset for developing nuclear weapons  is the Natanz uranium enrichment facility.,他们用于开发核武器的主要设备 是纳坦兹的铀浓缩设施。
"The gray boxes that you see,  these are real-time control systems.",各位看到的灰盒子 是实时控制系统。
"Now if we manage to compromise these systems  that control drive speeds and valves,  we can actually cause a lot of problems  with the centrifuge.",如果我们设法侵入这些 控制驱动器的速度和阀门的系统中， 我们实际上可以用离心机 造成很多问题。
The gray boxes don't run Windows software;  they are a completely different technology.,这个灰盒子不能运行Windows软件； 它们用的是完全不同的技术。
"But if we manage  to place a good Windows virus  on a notebook  that is used by a maintenance engineer  to configure this gray box,  then we are in business.",但如果我们设法 把一个Windows病毒 放到一名 设备工程师用于配置 这个灰盒子的笔记本上， 然后我们就可以开始行动了。
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.,这就是震网病毒背后的阴谋。
So we start with a Windows dropper.,那么我从一个Windows注入器开始。
"The payload goes onto the gray box,  damages the centrifuge,  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --  mission accomplished.",它携带的病毒传播到灰盒子， 破坏离心机， 伊朗核项目延迟 -- 任务完成。
"That's easy, huh?",很容易，是吧？
I want to tell you how we found that out.,我想告诉大家我们是如何发现这些的。
"When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.",当六个月前我们开始研究震网病毒时， 我们对它的目的一无所知。
"The only thing that was known  is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,  used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.",唯一知道的是， 它的Windows部分，注入器部分非常非常复杂， 使用了多重零日漏洞攻击。
"And it seemed to want to do something  with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.",它似乎想要对 这些灰盒子，这些实时控制系统做些什么。
"So that got our attention,  and we started a lab project  where we infected our environment with Stuxnet  and checked this thing out.",这引起了我们的注意， 我们启动了一个实验室项目， 用震网病毒感染我们的系统， 并进行了仔细的检查。
And then some very funny things happened.,接着一些非常有趣的事发生了。
"Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat  that didn't like our cheese --  sniffed, but didn't want to eat.",震网病毒表现的像只 不喜欢起司的大白鼠 -- 嗅一嗅起司，但并不想吃。
Didn't make sense to me.,我有些不理解。
"And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,  I realized, well, this is a directed attack.",而在我们实验了各种不同的起司之后， 我意识到，这是一个定向攻击。
It's completely directed.,它完全是定向的。
"The dropper is prowling actively  on the gray box if a specific configuration is found,  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect  is actually running on that target.",注入器就会 主动潜入灰盒子里， 即使它正试图感染的实际的程序 也在干着同样的事儿。
"And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.",如果没有找到目标，震网病毒什么也不做。
"So that really got my attention,  and we started to work on this  nearly around the clock,  because I thought, ""Well, we don't know what the target is.",这确实引起了我的注意， 我们开始昼夜不停的 对这个进行研究， 因为我觉得我们还不知道它的目标呢。
"It could be, let's say for example,  a U.S. power plant,  or a chemical plant in Germany.",目标也许是，打个比方， 一座美国发电厂， 或德国的化工厂。
"So we better find out what the target is soon.""",因此我们最好尽快找出它的目标。
"So we extracted and decompiled  the attack code,  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --  a smaller one and a bigger one.",我们提取并反编译了 攻击代码， 发现它包含两个数字炸弹 -- 一个小些的和一个大些的。
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered  by people who obviously had all insider information.,而我们也发现，它们是被了解所有内幕信息的人 非常专业地制作出来的。
They knew all the bits and bites  that they had to attack.,他们了解所要攻击 目标的所有细节。
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.,他们甚至知道操作员鞋子的号码。
So they know everything.,他们知道一切。
"And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet  is complex and high-tech,  let me tell you this:  the payload is rocket science.",如果各位曾经听说过，震网病毒的注入器 复杂且是高科技的， 让我告诉各位： 它携带的病毒非常复杂。
It's way above everything  that we have ever seen before.,这远超过我们 曾经见过的技术。
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.,在这儿各位能看到实际的攻击代码的片段。
"We are talking about --  around about 15,000 lines of code.",我们在讨论 -- 大约1万5千行代码。
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.,看起来很像旧式的汇编语言。
And I want to tell you how we were able  to make sense out of this code.,我想告诉各位我们是 如何弄明白这些代码的。
"So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,  because we know what they do.",我们首先要寻找的是系统函数调用， 因为我们知道这些函数做什么。
And then we were looking for timers and data structures  and trying to relate them to the real world --  to potential real world targets.,然后我们要找到定时器和数据结构， 接着尝试把它们和现实世界联系起来 -- 与潜在的现实世界目标联系起来。
So we do need target theories  that we can prove or disprove.,因此我们需要目标理论 我们能用它来证实与否。
"In order to get target theories,  we remember  that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,  it must be a high-value target  and it is most likely located in Iran,  because that's where most of the infections had been reported.",为了得到目标理论， 我们记得 这绝对会造成严重的破坏， 因此必然有个高价值的目标， 而且很有可能就位于伊朗境内， 因为在伊朗报告的病毒感染最多。
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.,在这一区域并不会发现许多目标。
It basically boils down  to the Bushehr nuclear power plant  and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.,基本上可以把目标缩小至 布歇赫尔核电厂 和纳坦兹的铀浓缩厂。
"So I told my assistant,  ""Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.""",因此我对我的助理说， “给我一个包含我们客户群中所有离心机和发电厂专家的列表。”
And I phoned them up and picked their brain  in an effort to match their expertise  with what we found in code and data.,我跟他们通了电话，让他们 用他们的专业知识帮忙 分析我们在代码和数据中的发现。
And that worked pretty well.,这非常管用。
So we were able to associate  the small digital warhead  with the rotor control.,我们能把这个小的 数字弹头与转子控制器 联系起来了。
"The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,  that black object that you see.",这个转子是离心机内部的运动机件， 就是各位看到的那个黑色物体。
"And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,  you are actually able to crack the rotor  and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.",如果控制这个转子的速度， 实际上就能破解转子 并甚至最终能让离心机爆炸。
"What we also saw  is that the goal of the attack  was really to do it slowly and creepy --  obviously in an effort  to drive maintenance engineers crazy,  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.",我们也看到了 攻击的目的 是让这一切令人恐怖的事缓慢地发生-- 显然这会 让维护工程师们发疯， 他们不可能很快找出问题所在。
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this  at data and data structures.,大的数字弹头 -- 通过仔细地 观察数据和数据结构，
"So for example, the number 164  really stands out in that code;  you can't overlook it.",我们有机会对它有所了解。 例如，数字164 在这些代码中非常引人注目； 不可能忽略它。
"I started to research scientific literature  on how these centrifuges  are actually built in Natanz  and found they are structured  in what is called a cascade,  and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.",我开始研究与这些分离机 如何被建造在纳坦兹 有关的科学文献， 并发现它们被组织在 一个被称为层级的东西之中， 每个层级包含164个离心机。
"So that made sense, that was a match.",这有点清楚了，匹配起来了。
And it even got better.,甚至更好地匹配了。
"These centrifuges in Iran  are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.",在伊朗的这些离心机 被分成15个所谓的机组。
And guess what we found in the attack code?,猜测我们在攻击代码中发现了什么？
An almost identical structure.,一个几乎完全相同的机组结构。
"So again, that was a real good match.",因此，再一次地很好地匹配上了。
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.,这在我们所进行的工作上给了我们更多自信。
"Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.",现在别误会我，它不是像这样进行的。
These results have been obtained  over several weeks of really hard labor.,这些结果中包含了 我们数周的辛苦劳动。
And we often went into just a dead end  and had to recover.,我们常常走入死胡同 并回到起点。
"Anyway, so we figured out  that both digital warheads  were actually aiming at one and the same target,  but from different angles.",总之，我们找出了 这两个从不同角度 瞄准着同一个目标的 数字弹头。
"The small warhead is taking one cascade,  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,  and the big warhead  is talking to six cascades  and manipulating valves.",小弹头选择一个层级， 旋转加速转子，接着让它们慢下来， 然后大弹头 选择六个层级 并操控阀门。
"So in all, we are very confident  that we have actually determined what the target is.",总的来说，我们非常自信 我们确定了目标是什么。
"It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.",就是纳坦兹，只可能是纳坦兹。
So we don't have to worry  that other targets  might be hit by Stuxnet.,我们并不担心 其他可能被震网病毒 要攻击的目标。
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --  really knocked my socks off.,有些我们看到的非常酷的东西 -- 确实让我大吃一惊的东西。
"Down there is the gray box,  and on the top you see the centrifuges.",这儿下面是灰盒子， 在上面看到的是离心机。
"Now what this thing does  is it intercepts the input values from sensors --  so for example, from pressure sensors  and vibration sensors --  and it provides legitimate program code,  which is still running during the attack,  with fake input data.",事情是这样的， 它拦截了从传感器发送来的输入值-- 例如，来自压力传感器 和震动传感器的输入值 -- 并提供合法的代码， 这代码会在攻击期间仍然保持运行， 随代码一起的还有假的输入数据。
"And as a matter of fact, this fake input data  is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.",事实上，这假的输入数据 是震网病毒事先预存的。
"So it's just like from the Hollywood movies  where during the heist,  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.",正如好莱坞电影 中的抢劫片段， 观察摄像头被连上了事先录制好的视频。
"That's cool, huh?",很酷，不是么？
The idea here is obviously  not only to fool the operators in the control room.,它的打算显然 不仅是要愚弄控制室中的操作员。
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.,它实际上要更危险，更具侵略性。
The idea  is to circumvent a digital safety system.,它的打算 是要绕过数字安全系统。
We need digital safety systems  where a human operator could not act quick enough.,我们需要数字安全系统 在那些人类操作员不能做出足够快的行动的地方。
"So for example, in a power plant,  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,  you must open relief valves within a millisecond.",例如，在发电厂， 当巨大的蒸汽轮机转速过快时， 必须在一毫秒内打开安全阀。
"Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.",显然，人类操作员不可能做到。
So this is where we need digital safety systems.,因此，在这儿就需要数字安全系统。
"And when they are compromised,  then real bad things can happen.",而当它们受到损害时， 真正的问题就会出现。
Your plant can blow up.,电厂会爆炸。
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.,操作员和安全系统都不会注意到。
That's scary.,这很可怕。
But it gets worse.,但还会更糟。
"And this is very important, what I'm going to say.",我将要说到的，非常重要。
Think about this:  this attack is generic.,想想这个。 这种攻击是通用的。
"It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,  with centrifuges,  with uranium enrichment.",它不需要对离心机， 对铀浓缩做什么 具体的事情。
"So it would work as well, for example,  in a power plant  or in an automobile factory.",它也将发挥作用，例如， 在一个发电厂 或是一个汽车制造厂。
It is generic.,这很普通。
"And you don't have -- as an attacker --  you don't have to deliver this payload  by a USB stick,  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.",作为一名攻击者，你不需要 -- 不需要用U盘把病毒 传播出去， 如我们在震网病毒这一案例中看到的那样。
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.,你也可以用传统的蠕虫技术进行传播。
Just spread it as wide as possible.,尽可能广泛地传播它。
"And if you do that,  what you end up with  is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.",如果做到了这些 最终就会拥有 一个大规模杀伤性的网络武器。
That's the consequence  that we have to face.,这就是我们不得不 面对的后果。
"So unfortunately,  the biggest number of targets for such attacks  are not in the Middle East.",不幸地是， 这类攻击数量最多的目标 不是在中东。
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.,而是在美国、欧洲和日本。
"So all of the green areas,  these are your target-rich environments.",所有这些绿色的区域， 这些是目标密集的区域。
"We have to face the consequences,  and we better start to prepare right now.",我们不得不面对这些后果， 我们最好立即开始做准备。
Thanks.,谢谢。
Chris Anderson: I've got a question.,克里斯·安德森：我有个问题。
"Ralph, it's been quite widely reported  that people assume that Mossad  is the main entity behind this.",拉尔夫，广为流传 人们认为摩萨德 是幕后主使。
Is that your opinion?,你怎么看？
"Ralph Langner: Okay, you really want to hear that?",拉尔夫·兰纳：好的，你真的想知道？
Yeah. Okay.,是的，好吧。
"My opinion is that the Mossad is involved,  but that the leading force is not Israel.",我认为摩萨德牵涉其中， 但主导力量不是以色列。
So the leading force behind that  is the cyber superpower.,其后的主导力量 是网络超级大国。
"There is only one,  and that's the United States --  fortunately, fortunately.",只有一个， 那就是美国 -- 很幸运，很幸运。
"Because otherwise,  our problems would even be bigger.",因为否则的话， 我们面临的问题就更加严重了。
"CA: Thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us. Thank you, Ralph.",克里斯：谢谢你吓了我们一大跳，谢谢你，拉尔夫。
"I want you now to imagine  a wearable robot  that gives you superhuman abilities,  or another one that takes wheelchair users  up standing and walking again.",我想大家现在想象一下 一个可穿戴的机器人， 它能提供给你超人般的能力， 或是让轮椅使用者 再次站起来行走。
We at Berkeley Bionics  call these robots exoskeletons.,我们在伯克利仿生技术公司 把这些机器人称为外骨骼。
"These are nothing else  than something that you put on in the morning,  and it will give you extra strength,  and it will further enhance your speed,  and it will help you, for instance, to manage your balance.",还没有其他任何东西 你早晨穿上后 它将为你提供额外的力量， 它将进一步提高你的速度， 它将帮你，比如，控制平衡。
It is actually the true integration  of the man and the machine.,实际上它真正地整合了 人和机器。
But not only that --  it will integrate and network you  to the universe  and other devices out there.,但不仅如此 -- 它还将整合并把你与 外界连接起来， 连接到其他设备上。
This is just not some blue sky thinking.,这不仅仅是些天马行空的想象。
"To show you now what we are working on  by starting out talking about  the American soldier,  that on average does carry about 100 lbs. on their backs,  and they are being asked to carry more equipment.",为了向各位展示一下我们目前在进行的工作， 我们来谈谈 美国士兵， 他们能在背上背大约100磅的重量， 而且还在被要求携带更多装备。
"Obviously, this is resulting  in some major complications --  back injuries, 30 percent of them --  chronic back injuries.",很显然，这会导致 一些并发的问题 -- 百分之三十的士兵有背部损伤 -- 慢性背部损伤。
So we thought we would look at this challenge  and create an exoskeleton  that would help deal with this issue.,所以我们想我们该正视这一挑战 创造一个能帮助 解决这一问题的外骨骼。
So let me now introduce to you HULC --  or the Human Universal  Load Carrier.,那么现在让我向各位介绍一下HULC -- 全称是人类 负重外骨骼。
"Soldier: With the HULC exoskeleton,  I can carry 200 lbs. over varied terrain  for many hours.",士兵：用了HULC外骨骼之后， 我能负重200磅。在复杂的地形中 行走多个小时。
"Its flexible design allows for deep squats,  crawls and high-agility movements.",它灵活的设计能让人深蹲， 匍匐前进和高灵活性运动。
"It senses what I want to do, where I want to go,  and then augments my strength and endurance.",它能感觉到我想做什么，想上哪儿去， 然后提升我的力量和耐力。
"Eythor Bender: We are ready with our industry partner  to introduce this device,  this new exoskeleton this year.",艾瑟·本德：我们与我们的行业伙伴以及准备好 引入这一设备， 在今年引入这一新的外骨骼。
So this is for real.,这是真的。
"Now let's turn our heads  towards the wheelchair users,  something that I'm particularly passionate about.",现在让我们把视线 转向轮椅使用者， 这是我个人非常热爱的部分。
There are 68 million people  estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide.,世界上估计有 6千8百万轮椅使用者。
This is about one percent of the total population.,大约占人口总数的百分之一。
And that's actually a conservative estimate.,这是个保守的估计。
"We are talking here about, oftentimes,  very young individuals with spinal cord injuries,  that in the prime of their life -- 20s, 30s, 40s --  hit a wall  and the wheelchair's the only option.",我们现在要说的是， 有脊髓损伤的非常年轻的人 在年富力强的时候 -- 20岁，30岁，40岁 -- 碰了壁 轮椅就成了唯一的选择。
But it is also the aging population  that is multiplying in numbers.,而且人口老龄化也 使得这一数字成倍增长。
"And the only option, pretty much --  when it's stroke or other complications --  is the wheelchair.",而这唯一的选择，大致上 -- 当人患有中风或是其他病症时 -- 就是轮椅。
"And that is actually for the last 500 years,  since its very successful introduction, I must say.",实际上最近500年来都是这样， 这是非常成功的介绍，我必须说。
So we thought we would start  writing a brand new chapter  of mobility.,因此，我想我们该开始 撰写机动性的新的 篇章了。
"Let me now introduce you to eLEGS  that is worn by Amanda Boxtel  that 19 years ago was spinal cord injured,  and as a result of that  she has not been able to walk  for 19 years until now.",现在让我向各位介绍eLEGS， 穿着者是阿曼达·波斯特， 她19年前受到了脊柱损伤， 由此导致 她19年来无法行走， 直到现在。

"And no, this isn't Burning Man  or San Francisco.",不是的，这不是指欲火焚烧的男人 也不是指旧金山。
"Ladies and gentlemen, meet your cousins.",女士们，先生们，见见你的近亲。
This is the world of wild bonobos  in the jungles of Congo.,这就是野生倭黑猩猩的世界 座落于刚果的丛林中。
"Bonobos are, together with chimpanzees,  your living closest relative.",倭黑猩猩和黑猩猩是 我们大家生活里最密切相关的近亲。
"That means we all share a common ancestor,  an evolutionary grandmother,  who lived around six million years ago.",这意味我们都享有一个共同的祖先， 一个进化了的祖母， 她生活在大约6百万年前。
"Now, chimpanzees are well-known  for their aggression.",现在，黑猩猩因 他们的好战而闻名于世。
"But unfortunately,  we have made too much of an emphasis  of this aspect  in our narratives of human evolution.",但不幸的是， 我们已经过分强调 这方面 在人类进化的历史中所起的作用。
But bonobos show us  the other side of the coin.,但是倭黑猩猩显示给我们的是 这硬币的另一面。
"While chimpanzees  are dominated by big, scary guys,  bonobo society  is run by empowered females.",当黑猩猩 被又大又吓人的雄黑猩猩统领时， 倭黑猩猩社群 是由雌倭黑猩猩所领导。
"These guys have really worked something out,  since this leads to a highly tolerant society  where fatal violence  has not been observed yet.",这些倭黑猩猩能相安无事地生活在一起， 由此形成了一个高度包容性的社会 在这社群，致命的暴力行为 还没有被观察到。
"But unfortunately,  bonobos are the least understood  of the great apes.",但不幸的是， 倭黑猩猩是类人猿里最难被了解的 一种。
"They live in the depths of the Congolese jungle,  and it has been very difficult to study them.",它们生活在刚果丛林的深处， 所以对它们的研究就是非常困难。
"The Congo is a paradox --  a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty,  but also the heart of darkness itself --  the scene of a violent conflict  that has raged for decades  and claimed nearly as many lives  as the First World War.",刚果是个似是而非的矛盾体-- 她是一块孕育非凡的生物多样性和美丽的土地， 但她自身也是黑暗之心-- 暴力冲突的场景 已经持续了几十年 这夺走了许多生命 就如第一次世界大战一样。
"Not surprisingly,  this destruction also endangers bonobo survival.",不足为奇的是， 这种破坏也危及倭黑猩猩的生存。
Bushmeat trades and forest loss  means we couldn't fill a small stadium  with all the bonobos that are left in the world --  and we're not even sure of that to be honest.,猎寻兽肉的买卖和丛林消失 意味着我们不能 给在世界上仅存的倭黑猩猩们提供一个小小的栖息地-- 实话，我们甚至都不能确定是否会有一个小的栖息地。
"Yet, in this land of violence and chaos,  you can hear hidden laughter  swaying the trees.",然而，在这个充斥暴力和混乱的土地上 你能听到隐隐约约的笑声 摇曳在树木中。
Who are these cousins?,这些近亲是些什么动物啊？
"We know them as the ""make love, not war"" apes  since they have frequent, promiscuous  and bisexual sex  to manage conflict  and solve social issues.",我们知道它们是“做爱，不要战争”的类人猿， 因此它们有频繁的，很随便的性生活 和双性性交 来处理冲突 和解决社会问题。
"Now, I'm not saying this is the solution  to all of humanity's problems --  since there's more to bonobo life  than the Kama Sutra.",我现在不是说这就是解决 人类所有问题的方法-- 因为玩乐对于倭黑猩猩来说 比起欲经意味更多。
"Bonobos, like humans,  love to play throughout their entire lives.",倭黑猩猩就像人类， 在它们的整个一生都爱玩乐。
Play is not just child's games.,玩乐不仅仅是孩子的游戏。
"For us and them,  play is foundational for bonding relationships  and fostering tolerance.",对于我们人类和倭黑猩猩， 玩乐是建立亲密关系 和培养容忍性的基础。
It's where we learn to trust  and where we learn about the rules of the game.,它也让我们学会信任 和游戏的规则
"Play increases creativity  and resilience,  and it's all about the generation of diversity --  diversity of interactions,  diversity of behaviors,  diversity of connections.",玩乐增进了创造力 和适应力， 它都是有关多样性的产生-- 多样性的相互作用， 多样性的行为， 和多样性的联系。
"And when you watch bonobo play,  you're seeing the very evolutionary roots  of human laughter, dance  and ritual.",当你看倭黑猩猩玩乐时， 你会看到非常进化的根源 有关人类的笑声，跳舞 和仪式。
Play is the glue  that binds us together.,玩乐就是粘结剂 使得我们相互联系在一起。
"Now, I don't know how you play,  but I want to show you a couple of unique clips  fresh from the wild.",现在我虽不知你是怎么玩乐的， 但我想给你们看两段 刚从野外拍摄到的特别剪辑。
"First, it's a ball game bonobo-style --  and I do not mean football.",首先，这是一个倭黑猩猩式的球类游戏-- 我不是指足球。
"So here,  we have a young female and a male  engaged in a chase game.",在这儿， 两只年轻的一雌一雄倭黑猩猩 在玩追逐游戏。
Have a look what she's doing.,看看她在做什么。
"It might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase,  ""she's got him by the balls.""",这可能就是短语 “她在玩弄他的蛋蛋。”的进化起源。
"Only I think that he's rather loving it here, right?",我只想到他相当喜欢这样的方式，对吧。
Yeah.,是的。
So sex play is common  in both bonobos and humans.,所以性游戏 在倭黑猩猩和人类两者身上都是司空见惯的。
And this video is really interesting  because it shows --  this video's really interesting  because it shows the inventiveness  of bringing unusual elements into play --  such as testicles --  and also how play both requires trust  and fosters trust --  while at the same time being tremendous fun.,这个视频真的很有趣 因为它证明-- 这个视频真的很有趣 因为它证明了 把不寻常的因素带进游戏里所产生的创造性-- 例如睾丸-- 游戏如何能寻求信任 和培养信任-- 与此同时又乐趣无穷。
But play's a shapeshifter.,但玩乐是一个变形的过程。
"Play's a shapeshifter,  and it can take many forms,  some of which are more quiet,  imaginative, curious --  maybe where wonder is discovered anew.",玩乐是一个变形的过程， 它可以变成许多玩乐游戏， 一些游戏是较安静的， 富有想象力的，探于求索的-- 或许这玩乐的奇妙是发现新鲜事。
"And I want you to see,  this is Fuku, a young female,  and she is quietly playing with water.",我想让大家看看， 这是福酷，一个年轻雌倭黑猩猩， 她正在悄然地玩耍水。
"I think, like her,  we sometimes play alone,  and we explore the boundaries  of our inner and our outer worlds.",我认为，就像她， 我们有时独自玩耍， 我们探索着 我们内心和我们外部世界的界限。
"And it's that playful curiosity  that drives us to explore, drives us to interact,  and then the unexpected connections we form  are the real hotbed for creativity.",正是玩乐的新奇感 驱使我们去探索，驱使我们去互动联系。 然后我们所形成的这种意想不到的联系 是真正孕育创造力的温床。
So these are just small tasters  into the insights that bonobo give us  to our past and present.,因此这些仅是浅尝而已 由倭黑猩猩带给我们这种深刻的洞察力 来探索我们的过去和现在。
"But they also hold a secret for our future,  a future where we need to adapt  to an increasingly challenging world  through greater creativity  and greater cooperation.",但它们也对我们的未来保有一个秘密， 在未来我们需要适应 一个日益充满挑战性的世界 通过史无前例的创造性 和更多的合作来做到。
The secret is that play is the key  to these capacities.,这秘密是玩乐是 具备这些能力的关键。
"In other words,  play is our adaptive wildcard.",换言之， 玩乐是我们适应未来的万能牌。
"In order to adapt successfully  to a changing world,  we need to play.",为了成功地适应 一个变化中的世界， 我们需要玩乐。
But will we make the most of our playfulness?,但我们要尽可能地嬉戏玩乐吗？
Play is not frivolous.,玩乐不是无足轻重的；
Play's essential.,玩乐是至关重要的。
"For bonobos and humans alike,  life is not just red in tooth and claw.",对于倭黑猩猩和人类一样， 生活不仅仅是血红的牙齿和利爪。
"In times when it seems least appropriate to play,  it might be the times when it is most urgent.",好似最不适宜去玩乐的时候， 但它可能是最迫切需要玩乐的时候。
"And so, my fellow primates,  let us embrace this gift from evolution  and play together,  as we rediscover creativity,  fellowship and wonder.",那么，我的灵长类的同胞们， 让我们拥护这天赋进化的礼物 让我们一起嬉戏玩乐， 由此我们重新发现创造力， 情同手足的关系和奇迹。
Thank you.,谢谢。

"This may sound strange,  but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.",听起来可能有点怪， 我是个水泥砖的狂热爱好者。
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868  with a very simple idea:  modules made of cement of a fixed measurement  that fit together.,第一块水泥砖制造于1868年 是源于一个非常简单的想法： 把水泥制成的固定大小的块 组装到一起。
Very quickly concrete blocks became  the most-used construction unit in the world.,很快水泥砖就成为了 全世界使用最多的建筑单元，
"They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,  buildings, bridges,  one brick at a time.",它使得我们能制造远大于自身的东西， 建筑，桥梁， 就这样一砖一瓦砌成。
Essentially concrete blocks had become  the building block of our time.,水泥砖实质上已经成为 我们这个时代的积木。
"Almost a hundred years later in 1947,  LEGO came up with this.",在大约100年后的1947年， 乐高带来了这个
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.,当时被叫做自动组装积木。
"And in a few short years,  LEGO bricks took place in every household.",然后在短短几年内， 乐高积木占领了每个家庭，
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --  or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.,据估计已经制造出的乐高积木超过4千亿块 -- 或者说全球人均75块
"You don't have to be an engineer  to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.",你不必是一个工程师 也可以建造漂亮的房子，漂亮的桥梁，漂亮的建筑。
LEGO made it accessible.,乐高使之成为可能。
"LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,  and made it into the building block  of our imagination.",乐高实质上就是把水泥砖，这种真实世界中的积木， 运用到建造我们想象中的 建筑积木。
"Meanwhile the exact same year,  at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,  the next building block.",恰恰在同一年， 在贝尔实验室，一项新的革命即将发布， 下一代积木。
The transistor was a small plastic unit  that would take us from a world  of static bricks piled on top of each other  to a world where everything was interactive.,晶体管是一个小的塑料元件 它将把我们从 静态的砖块堆积起来的世界 带入到一切都可以交互的新世界。
"Like the concrete block,  the transistor allows you to build  much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.",像水泥砖一样， 你可以运用它 一个晶体管一个晶体管地制造出更大的、更复杂的电路。
But there's a main difference:  The transistor was only for experts.,但是有一个主要的区别： 只有专家才能玩转晶体管。
"I personally don't accept this,  that the building block of our time  is reserved for experts,  so I decided to change that.",我个人不能接受 我们这个时代的积木 只有专家才可以玩， 所以我决定改变它。
"Eight years ago when I was at the Media Lab,  I started exploring this idea  of how to put the power of engineers  in the hands of artists and designers.",8年前当我在媒体实验室的时候， 我开始思索 如何才能把工程师所独有的力量 也赋予艺术家和设计师。
A few years ago I started developing littleBits.,几年前我开始开发littleBits。
Let me show you how they work.,我给大家演示一下是怎么玩的。
LittleBits are electronic modules  with each one specific function.,LittleBits是电子的模块 每一块都有特定的功能。
"They're pre-engineered  to be light, sound,  motors and sensors.",它们都预先设定好 作为光的，声音的， 马达或者传感器。
And the best part about it  is they snap together with magnets.,最棒的就是 它们是用磁力吸合在一起的
So you can't put them the wrong way.,所以就不可能组装错
The bricks are color-coded.,这些小块是按颜色分类的。
"Green is output, blue is power,  pink is input and orange is wire.",绿色是输出，蓝色是电源， 粉色是输入，橙色是连接线。
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green  and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.,因此你所需要做的就是把蓝色接到绿色上 然后很快你就能开始制造更大的电路了
"You put a blue to a green,  you can make light.",把蓝的接到绿的， 你就做了一个灯
You can put a knob in between  and now you've made a little dimmer.,你可以在中间放一个旋钮 你就做成了一个小调光器。
"Switch out the knob  for a pulse module,  which is here,  and now you've made a little blinker.",拿掉旋钮 换上脉冲模块， 在这儿， 现在你就创造出了一个小信号灯。
Add this buzzer  for some extra punch  and you've created a noise machine.,加入这个蜂鸣器 来增加点效果 你就创造出了一台噪音机。
I'm going to stop that.,我得收手了。
"So beyond simple play,  littleBits are actually pretty powerful.",除了简单地玩， 实际上littleBits 的功能很强劲。
"Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,  littleBits allow you to program  using very simple intuitive gestures.",不需要编程、接线、焊接， littleBits可以让你 用简单的直觉动作完成编程。
"So to make this blink faster or slower,  you would just turn this knob  and basically make it pulse faster or slower.",比如要把这个闪烁调快或者调慢一点， 你只需要转这个旋钮 实际上是让它脉冲得快或者慢一点。
The idea behind littleBits  is that it's a growing library.,隐藏在littleBits之后的想法是 这是一个可成长的资料库。
We want to make every single interaction in the world  into a ready-to-use brick.,我们想把世界上的每一个单独的交互功能 做成一个随手可用的积木。
"Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --  everything should be accessible.",光，声音，太阳能板，马达 -- 一切都应该触手可得。
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.,我们曾经把littleBits给孩子们并看他们玩。
And it's been an incredible experience.,那是一种不可思议的体验。
The nicest thing is how they start to understand  the electronics around them from everyday  that they don't learn at schools.,最棒的就是他们开始理解 他们日常身边的电器 这些学校里是学不到的。
"For example, how a nightlight works,  or why an elevator door stays open,  or how an iPod responds to touch.",比如，夜灯是如何工作的 或者为什么电梯门能一直开着， 再或者iPod对触摸是怎么反应的。
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.,我们也曾经把littleBits带到设计学校。
"So for example, we've had designers  with no experience with electronics whatsoever  start to play with littleBits as a material.",比如说，我们曾经让设计师 完全没有电子相关经验的设计师 用littleBits做素材开始玩。
"Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,  we have Geordie making ...",大家可以看到，用毡和纸瓶子 乔迪做出了...
"A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD  and gave them to some designers  with no experience in engineering whatsoever --  just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them ""Make something.""",几星期前我们带着littleBits去了罗德岛设计学院 把它交给一些 完全没有工程经验的设计师 只给一些纸板、木头和纸 -- 跟他们说 “做点什么”
"Here's an example of a project they made,  a motion-activated confetti canon ball.",这就是他们完成的一个项目 一个动作触发的彩纸屑炮弹
"But wait, this is actually my favorite project.",等等，这个实际上是我最喜欢的一个项目。
It's a lobster made of playdough  that's afraid of the dark.,是一个橡皮泥做的龙虾 它很怕黑。
"To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,  electronics became just another material.",对这些非工程技术人员，littleBits成为了另一种材料， 电子也只是一种材料。
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.,而且我们想使这种材料对所有人都可用。
So littleBits is open-source.,所以littleBits是开源的。
"You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.",你可以到网站上，下载所有的设计文件，自己来制造。
"We want to encourage a world  of creators, of inventors, of contributors,  because this world that we live in,  this interactive world, is ours.",我们想鼓励一个 人人都是创造者、发明家、贡献者的世界。 因为我们所生活的这个世界， 这个交互的世界，属于我们每个人。
So go ahead and start inventing.,不要犹豫，开始你的发明吧。
Thank you.,谢谢大家。
Today I'm going to talk  about unexpected discoveries.,今天，我要谈一谈 一些出人意料的发现
Now I work in the solar technology industry.,现在我在太阳能技术产业工作
And my small startup  is looking to force ourselves  into the environment  by paying attention to ...,我那间小小的公司刚刚创办 正在寻求迫使我们 融入自然的方法 这要通过关注...
... paying attention to crowd-sourcing.,关注众包来实现
It's just a quick video  of what we do.,这段小视频 展示了我们所做的工作
Huh. Hang on a moment.,哈，等一下
It might take a moment to load.,加载视频需要点时间
We'll just -- we can just skip --  I'll just skip through the video instead ...,也许我们可以跳过-- 我会跳过视频...
No.,不要啊
This is not ...,这不是...
Okay.,好吧
Solar technology is ...,太阳能技术是...
"Oh, that's all my time?",不会吧，我的时间已经到了？
Okay. Thank you very much.,好吧，非常感谢
So a couple of years ago I started a program  to try to get the rockstar tech and design people  and work in the one environment  that represents pretty much everything they're supposed to hate;  we have them work in government.,几年前，我启动了一个 让一些厉害的搞技术和设计的人员们 在一个应该代表 他们所憎恨的一切的环境 - 政府部门 - 内工作一年的项目。
"The program is called Code for America,  and it's a little bit like a Peace Corps for geeks.",这个项目叫做 “美国代码”， 有点像怪杰的和平队。
We select a few fellows every year  and we have them work with city governments.,我们每年筛选几个人， 然后让他们为政府工作。
"Instead of sending them off into the Third World,  we send them into the wilds of City Hall.",不将他们送入第三世界， 但将他们送入市政府厅。
"And there they make great apps, they work with city staffers.",在那里，他们创造很好的应用程序，并与市政府人员一起工作。
But really what they're doing is they're showing what's possible  with technology today.,但他们真正的目的是展现今天科技 可以创造的可能性。
So meet Al.,这是Al。
Al is a fire hydrant in the city of Boston.,Al是一个伯斯顿市内的消防栓。
"Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,  but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,  because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires  when he's covered in four feet of snow.",这里看起来它似乎是在等它的约会， 但它真正等待的是一个可以将它被深埋在雪下的时候可以将它挖出来的人， 因为它知道当它被四英尺的雪埋入时， 它救火的能力就会下降。
Now how did he come to be looking for help  in this very unique manner?,它是如何用这样一种特殊的方式 来寻求帮助的呢？
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year  through the Code for America program.,去年我们“美国代码” 有个在伯斯顿工作的团队。
"They were there in February, and it snowed a lot in February last year.",他们在的时候正值二月，而去年二月雪下得很多很大。
And they noticed that the city never gets  to digging out these fire hydrants.,他们注意到这个城市的 消防栓很少会被挖出。
"But one fellow in particular,  a guy named Erik Michaels-Ober,  noticed something else,  and that's that citizens are shoveling out sidewalks  right in front of these things.",那个团队的其中一个人， 叫Erik Michaels-Ober， 留意到了另外一个现象： 市民们会将这些消防栓 前面的走道上的雪铲除。
"So he did what any good developer would do,  he wrote an app.",所以他做了任何一个优秀的程序员都会做的事情， 他写了一个应用程序。
It's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant.,这是一个可以让你领养一个消防栓的可爱简易的程序。
So you agree to dig it out when it snows.,然后你同意会在下雪后将它挖出。
"If you do, you get to name it,  and he called the first one Al.",如果你这么做了，你可以为它取个名字； 他叫了这第一个Al。
"And if you don't, someone can steal it from you.",但如果你不将它挖出，其他人可以将它从你那儿偷走。
So it's got cute little game dynamics on it.,所以它有一些小小的娱乐性质在里面。
This is a modest little app.,这是一个相对来说比较小的程序，
It's probably the smallest  of the 21 apps that the fellows wrote last year.,它或许是那个团队那年 所写的二十一个程序中最小的一个。
But it's doing something  that no other government technology does.,但它做到了 任何其他政府科技无法做到的事情；
It's spreading virally.,它像病毒一样传开了。
"There's a guy in the I.T. department of the City of Honolulu  who saw this app and realized  that he could use it, not for snow,  but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens.",一个在夏威夷檀香山市的IT部门上班的人 看到了这个程序，然后意识到 它不一定要用它来铲雪， 也可以用它让市民领养海啸警报器。
"It's very important that these tsunami sirens work,  but people steal the batteries out of them.",这些海啸警报器的功能很重要， 但往往有人会偷那里面的电池。
So he's getting citizens to check on them.,所以他让市民们主动去检查它们。
And then Seattle decided to use it  to get citizens to clear out clogged storm drains.,然后西雅图决定用它 让市民清理暴雨后杜塞的下水道口。
And Chicago just rolled it out  to get people to sign up to shovel sidewalks when it snows.,芝加哥才开始 用它让人们将走道上的雪铲除。
So we now know of nine cities  that are planning to use this.,我们现在知道还有九个城市 计划使用它。
"And this has spread just frictionlessly,  organically, naturally.",它就这样平稳地，有机地，自然地， 散布了开来。
"If you know anything about government technology,  you know that this isn't how it normally goes.",如果你对政府的科技有些了解， 你会知道这并不是普遍的结果。
Procuring software usually takes a couple of years.,开发完成一个软件往往需要几年。
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year  that took three people about two and a half months.,去年我们在伯斯顿有一个 三个人的团队花了两个半月完成了一个项目。
It was a way that parents could figure out  which were the right public schools for their kids.,它可以帮助家长决定 哪一个公立学校对他们的孩子最适合。
"We were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels,  it would have taken at least two years  and it would have cost about two million dollars.",之后，我们被告知，如果这个项目通过正常的渠道， 它将需要至少两年的时间， 并会花费将近两百万美元左右。
And that's nothing.,而这只是一个小数字。
"There is one project in the California court system right now  that so far cost taxpayers  two billion dollars,  and it doesn't work.",加利福尼亚的法院系统正有一个 至今花费了纳税人 二十亿美元的一个项目， 而它还并不能正常运作。
And there are projects like this  at every level of government.,而在政府的每一个阶级 都有类似的种种项目。
"So an app that takes a couple of days to write  and then spreads virally, that's sort of a shot across the bow  to the institution of government.",所以一个只需要几天来编程， 并像病毒般散布的程序， 对政府机构来说 是一个警钟。
"It suggests how government could work better --  not more like a private company,  as many people think it should.",它见证了政府可以变得更有效率 - 但不是更像私有公司， 像很多人觉得的那样。
"And not even like a tech company,  but more like the Internet itself.",甚至不像一个科技公司， 而更像网络本身。
"And that means permissionless,  it means open, it means generative.",这意味着无须批准， 公开，多产。
And that's important.,而这非常重要。
"But what's more important about this app  is that it represents how a new generation  is tackling the problem of government --  not as the problem of an ossified institution,  but as a problem of collective action.",但这种程序所代表的，更重要的， 是新一代的人 将政府的问题 当作团体行动的问题来寻求解决方式， 而并不是一个死板的机构。
"And that's great news,  because, it turns out, we're very good at collective action  with digital technology.",而这是很好的信息， 因为，事实表明，我们在对于数码技术 的团体运行非常擅长。
Now there's a very large community of people  that are building the tools that we need  to do things together effectively.,现在已经有一个非常大的团体 在建造可以让我们做事 更加有效率的工具。
"It's not just Code for America fellows,  there are hundreds of people all over the country  that are standing and writing civic apps  every day in their own communities.",它不仅仅是“美国代码”的员工们， 全国有几百个人 每天在自己的社区中编写程序 并将其致用在他们自己的社区。
They haven't given up on government.,他们没有放弃政府。
"They are frustrated as hell with it,  but they're not complaining about it,  they're fixing it.",虽然他们对此非常失望， 但他们并没有抱怨， 而在尝试着改善它。
And these folks know something  that we've lost sight of.,这些人知道一些 我们已经失去的东西，
"And that's that when you strip away all your feelings  about politics and the line at the DMV  and all those other things  that we're really mad about,  government is, at its core,  in the words of Tim O'Reilly,  ""What we do together that we can't do alone.""",那就是，当你剥开一切 让我们愤怒的外壳， 比如我们对政治的感觉， 和在车辆管理局外的长队， 政府，在其中心， 用提姆·奥莱理的话说， “政府能帮我们达成我们一个人无法达成的事情。”
Now a lot of people have given up on government.,现在有很多人都对政府完全灰了心。
"And if you're one of those people,  I would ask that you reconsider,  because things are changing.",如果你是他们其中的一个， 我希望你能重新考虑下， 因为很多事情都在改变。
Politics is not changing;  government is changing.,政治没有改变， 但政府正在改变。
"And because government  ultimately derives its power from us --  remember ""We the people?"" --  how we think about it  is going to effect how that change happens.",而因为政府的能量， 从最根本上 来自于我们人民， 我们如何看待它 将会影响到它的改变。
Now I didn't know very much about government when I started this program.,当我开始这个项目的时候我对政府所知不多。
"And like a lot of people,  I thought government was basically about getting people elected to office.",就像很多人， 我以为政府仅仅是选举人员进入部门工作。
"Well after two years, I've come to the conclusion  that, especially local government,  is about opossums.",两年后，我得到了一个结论。 政府，特别是地方政府， 是关于负鼠.
This is the call center for the services and information line.,这里是服务和信息的电话热线中心。
It's generally where you will get  if you call 311 in your city.,如果你在你的城市拨打311， 你将会被连接到这里。
"If you should ever have the chance  to staff your city's call center,  as our fellow Scott Silverman did as part of the program --  in fact, they all do that --  you will find that people call government  with a very wide range of issues,  including having an opossum stuck in your house.",如果你会有机会 在你的市热线中心工作， 像我们项目的同事Scott Silverman就做这个 - 事实上，他们都需要做这项服务 - 你就会发现人们为了非常不同的问题 打电话给政府咨询， 包括家中困入了一个负鼠。
So Scott gets this call.,Scott 接到了这通电话。
"He types ""Opossum"" into this official knowledge base.",他将“负鼠”输入了官方的信息库。
He doesn't really come up with anything. He starts with animal control.,什么都没有。他从动物控制中心开始。
"And finally, he says, ""Look, can you just open all the doors to your house  and play music really loud  and see if the thing leaves?""",而最后，他说：“这样吧，你可以将你家的门全部打开， 然后放起很大声的音乐， 然后看看这东西会不会离开？”
So that worked. So booya for Scott.,而这起了作用。 Scott，好样的。
But that wasn't the end of the opossums.,但这并不是负鼠故事的结尾。
Boston doesn't just have a call center.,波斯顿没有热线中心。
"It has an app, a Web and mobile app,  called Citizens Connect.",它有一个程序，一个网站和移动的程序， 叫做 “市民联通”。
Now we didn't write this app.,我们没有编写这个程序。
This is the work of the very smart people  at the Office of New Urban Mechanics in Boston.,它是一群在波斯顿的 新城市结构部门的很聪明的人编写的。
"So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in:  ""Opossum in my trashcan. Can't tell if it's dead.",有一天 - 这是一个真实的报告 - 这个信息被贴了出来： “垃圾桶里有一个负鼠。看不出来它是否死了。
"How do I get this removed?""",我怎样才能把它弄掉？”
But what happens with Citizens Connect is different.,“市民联通”对这种问题有不同的处理方式。
So Scott was speaking person-to-person.,Scott之前是人对人的交流。
"But on Citizens Connect everything is public,  so everybody can see this.",但在“市民联通”上面一切都是公开的， 所以每个人都可以看见。
"And in this case, a neighbor saw it.",这一次，一个邻居看到了。
"And the next report we got said,  ""I walked over to this location,  found the trashcan behind the house.",我们收到的下一份报告写着： “我路过了这个地点， 找到了房子后面的垃圾桶。
Opossum? Check. Living? Yep.,负鼠? 看到了。的确活着。
Turned trashcan on its side. Walked home.,将垃圾桶放倒，走回家。
"Goodnight sweet opossum.""",晚安，小负鼠。”
Pretty simple.,就这么简单。
So this is great. This is the digital meeting the physical.,所以这很好。这就是现实和数码世界的交汇。
And it's also a great example  of government getting in on the crowd-sourcing game.,这也是政府加入 众包游戏的一个很好的例子。
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.,但这也是一个由政府来做交流平台的很好的例子。
And I don't mean necessarily  a technological definition of platform here.,而在这里我并不是 在说平台的技术层面的定义。
I'm just talking about a platform for people  to help themselves and to help others.,我只是想提到一个可以让 人们互相帮助的平台。
"So one citizen helped another citizen,  but government played a key role here.",一个公民帮助另外一个公民， 而政府在其中扮演重要的角色。
It connected those two people.,它将两个人连系了起来。
"And it could have connected them with government services if they'd been needed,  but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative  to government services.",它可以通过政府设施服务来帮助需要的人， 但一个邻居远比政府服务 简单和见效。
"When one neighbor helps another,  we strengthen our communities.",当一个邻居帮助另外一个的时候， 我们的社会联系也会加强。
"We call animal control, it just costs a lot of money.",我们打电话给动物控制中心的话，只会花很多的钱。
Now one of the important things we need to think about government  is that it's not the same thing as politics.,一个我们需要思考的很重要的事情 便是政府并不同于政治。
"And most people get that,  but they think that one is the input to the other.",很多人明白这点， 但他们仍然认为政治是政府的输入口。
That our input to the system of government  is voting.,我们对政府系统的输入口是 通过选票。
"Now how many times have we elected a political leader --  and sometimes we spend a lot of energy  getting a new political leader elected --  and then we sit back and we expect government  to reflect our values and meet our needs,  and then not that much changes?",至今为止，我们选了多少政治领袖 - 而有些时候我们会花大量的精力 来支持一个新的政治领袖的选举 - 然后我们期望着政府做一些 反映我们价值观和我们的需要的事情， 但最后没有多少改变发生？
That's because government is like a vast ocean  and politics is the six-inch layer on top.,那是因为政府就像一片巨大的海洋， 而政治只是最顶上的一层。
And what's under that  is what we call bureaucracy.,下面的便是 我们所谓的官僚机构。
And we say that word with such contempt.,我们用如此鄙夷的语气谈论这个词。
"But it's that contempt  that keeps this thing that we own  and we pay for  as something that's working against us, this other thing,  and then we're disempowering ourselves.",但正是这种鄙夷 保持了这个我们拥有 并为其付钱维持的东西 一直与我们的愿望背道而驰， 而由此我们正失去我们自己的能量。
People seem to think politics is sexy.,人们似乎认为政治很性感。
"If we want this institution to work for us,  we're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy.",如果我们希望这个部门来为我们服务， 我们必须要让官僚机构也变得性感。
Because that's where the real work of government happens.,因为政府的真正工作在那里发生。
We have to engage with the machinery of government.,我们必须参与政府的系统。
So that's OccupytheSEC movement has done.,而这正是占领美国证券交易委员会运动做的。
Have you seen these guys?,你见过这些人吗？
It's a group of concerned citizens  that have written a very detailed  325-page report  that's a response to the SEC's request for comment  on the Financial Reform Bill.,他们是一群忧心忡忡的公民 他们写了一份非常详细的， 325页的报告 来回应美国证券交易委员会SEC 对于金融改革法案的要求。
"That's not being politically active,  that's being bureaucratically active.",这不是参与政治， 而是积极参与到官僚机构中。
"Now for those of us who've given up on government,  it's time that we asked ourselves  about the world that we want to leave for our children.",现在，对于我们之间的已经放弃了政府的人， 是时候问我们自己 我们希望留下怎样的世界给我们的孩子。
You have to see the enormous challenges  that they're going to face.,大家必须意识到他们需要 面对巨大的挑战。
Do we really think we're going to get where we need to go  without fixing the one institution  that can act on behalf of all of us?,在我们没有改善好这个可以 代表我们行动的机构之前， 我们真的认为我们可以达到我们想要达到的目标吗？
"We can't do without government,  but we do need it  to be more effective.",我们不能没有政府， 我们需要它 变得更有效率。
The good news is that technology is making it possible  to fundamentally reframe  the function of government  in a way that can actually scale  by strengthening civil society.,好的消息是，科技正使这变得可行 在本质上重新定义 政府的功能 而通过它我们可以 来加强我们的公民社会。
"And there's a generation out there that's grown up on the Internet,  and they know that it's not that hard  to do things together,  you just have to architect the systems the right way.",现在的一代正在网络中长大， 而他们知道 同时做一件事情并不难， 只需要将系统建构好。
"Now the average age of our fellows is 28,  so I am, begrudgingly,  almost a generation older than most of them.",我们的工作人员的平均年龄是28岁， 所以我，很不甘的， 几乎比他们大部分老了一代。
This is a generation  that's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted.,这一代 在长大中已经习惯代言他们自身。
They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting  about who gets to speak;  they all get to speak.,他们不再需要经历我们那一代关于 谁可以拥有言论自由的战斗； 他们都拥有言论自由。
"They can express their opinion  on any channel at any time,  and they do.",他们可以通过任何渠道 在任何时间表达他们的意见， 他们也的确这么做。
"So when they're faced with the problem of government,  they don't care as much  about using their voices.",所以当他们面对政府的瑕疵时， 他们不怎么关心 用他们的话语权来代言。
They're using their hands.,他们会使用他们的双手。
They're using their hands  to write applications that make government work better.,他们正在使用他们的双手 来编写可以让政府更好地运作的程序。
And those applications let us use our hands  to make our communities better.,而这些程序让我们用我们自己的双手 来完善我们的社会。
"That could be shoveling out a hydrant, pulling a weed,  turning over a garbage can with an opossum in it.",它可以是将消防栓从雪中挖出，将杂草拔除， 或将有负鼠的垃圾桶放倒。
"And certainly, we could have been shoveling out those fire hydrants all along,  and many people do.",当然，很多人早就开始将消防栓 从雪中挖出了。
"But these apps are like little digital reminders  that we're not just consumers,  and we're not just consumers of government,  putting in our taxes and getting back services.",但这些程序就如同小数字闹钟，可以提醒 我们不光是作为消费者。 我们也不仅仅是政府的消费对象， 缴税而换回服务。
"We're more than that,  we're citizens.",我们不光是这些， 我们还是公民。
And we're not going to fix government  until we fix citizenship.,在改善政府之前， 我们必须承担我们作为公民的责任。
"So the question I have for all of you here:  When it comes to the big, important things  that we need to do together,  all of us together,  are we just going to be a crowd of voices,  or are we also going to be  a crowd of hands?",所以在这里我留给大家一个问题： 当我们面对一些很大的，很重要的， 并需要我们齐心协力一起做 事情的时候， 我们会只是有话语权的一群人， 还是我们 也会是众手协力而成事的一群人？

"In Rwanda, even after the genocide, there was this commitment,  but in this country we haven't done that.",在卢旺达，即使种族灭绝后，人们还是正视了 但是在美国我们不愿意这么干
I was giving some lectures in Germany about the death penalty.,我也在德国谈过死刑的问题
"It was fascinating  because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation  and said, ""Well you know it's deeply troubling  to hear what you're talking about.""",结果很绝妙 因为在讲谈后有个学者站起来 说：“你要知道， 听你谈这个很痛心。”
"He said, ""We don't have the death penalty in Germany.",她说：“我们德国没有死刑。
"And of course, we can never have the death penalty in Germany.""",当然了，我们德国永远也不可能有死刑。”
"And the room got very quiet,  and this woman said,  ""There's no way, with our history,  we could ever engage  in the systematic killing of human beings.",全场肃静 这位女士说： “因为我们的历史， 我们永不可能决定 有系统地杀人。
"It would be unconscionable for us  to, in an intentional and deliberate way,  set about executing people.""",公开化且下意识地 执行死刑，对我们来说 是良心上无法接受的
And I thought about that.,我思考了这个问题
"What would it feel like  to be living in a world  where the nation state of Germany was executing people,  especially if they were disproportionately Jewish?",如果我整天 都看着德国人杀人 毫无道理地屠杀犹太人 我会有什么感受？
I couldn't bear it.,我无法忍受
It would be unconscionable.,那真是太不合理了
"And yet, in this country,  in the states of the Old South,  we execute people --  where you're 11 times more likely to get the death penalty  if the victim is white than if the victim is black,  if the defendant is black and the victim is white --  in the very states where there are buried in the ground  the bodies of people who were lynched.",但是，在我们这个国家 在南方各州 我们真的在屠杀—— 当仅仅因为受害人是白人而不是黑人 你被判死刑的机率上升十倍时 当仅仅因为被告是黑人而不是白人 你被判死刑的机率上升二十一倍时—— 在这些州，到处埋着 被私刑处死的人
"And yet, there is this disconnect.",可是，我们还是漠不关心

"But ultimately,  those realities  are shadowed by suffering,  abuse, degradation,  marginalization.",但是最终 这些好的现实 都被痛苦煎熬， 滥用职权，剥夺人权 边缘化，蒙上了阴影

"Because ultimately we are talking  about a need to be more hopeful,  more committed, more dedicated  to the basic challenges of living in a complex world.",因为最终我们谈的 是怎么更有希望 更有保障，更有贡献 来应付生活在这个复杂社会中的种种挑战
"And for me that means  spending time thinking and talking  about the poor, the disadvantaged,  those who will never get to TED.",对于我来说那需要 花时间思考和讨论 穷人阶层，弱势群体 那些永远也没机会来TED的人
But thinking about them in a way  that is integrated in our own lives.,不过想着他们其实在某种意义上 是把他们融合进我们的生活里
"You know ultimately, we all have to believe things we haven't seen.",要知道最终，我们得相信那些没亲眼见的事
"We do. As rational as we are, as committed to intellect as we are.",我们不得不。作为理智的社会，这么聪明的社会
"Innovation, creativity,  development comes  not from the ideas in our mind alone.",革新，创造 发展，并不仅仅 在我们脑子里空想出来的
They come from the ideas in our mind  that are also fueled  by some conviction in our heart.,它们是从我们脑子里的智慧 和我们心里的信念 相结合的产物
"And it's that mind-heart connection  that I believe compels us  to not just be attentive  to all the bright and dazzly things,  but also the dark and difficult things.",这个灵智合一 我相信会驱使我们 不仅仅是对那些 光明的事情更上心 同时对那些黑暗面和棘手的事情也是一样
"Vaclav Havel, the great Czech leader, talked about this.",韦克拉乌·哈韦尔，这位捷克的杰出领导人，谈过这个问题
"He said, ""When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with oppression,  we wanted all kinds of things,  but mostly what we needed was hope,  an orientation of the spirit,  a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places  and be a witness.""",他说：“当我们在东欧解决强制压迫的问题时 我们希望能成就很多 但是最重要的，我们要一个希望 一个心灵的指向 一种不惮于体会绝望的态度 以及为史留证的意愿。”
Well that orientation of the spirit  is very much at the core of what I believe  even TED communities  have to be engaged in.,这个心灵的指向 就是我的核心信念 我们的TED社会 也要参与进来
"There is no disconnect  around technology and design  that will allow us to be fully human  until we pay attention to suffering,  to poverty, to exclusion, to unfairness, to injustice.",这里不应有任何东西把 高新的科技和完美的设计 和我们的人性间隔开来 只要我们还能注意到痛苦 注意到贫穷，制约，不公，和冤屈

It will get to you.,它会影响你

"She said, ""That's going to make you tired, tired, tired.""",她说：“这些会让你很累，很累，很累的。”
"And that's when Ms. Carr leaned forward, she put her finger in my face,  she said, ""That's why you've got to be brave, brave, brave.""",这时卡尔夫人凑过来，她把手放在我脸边说： “这就是为什么你要很勇敢很勇敢很勇敢。”

What would you say to someone who believed that?,你对持这个说法的人会怎么讲？

It was this misguided war on drugs.,而是由毒品的滥用所导致的
in our prison population.,这才是我们监狱人口

Peter Diamandis: So those are just a few of the clips  I collected over the last six months --  could have easily been the last six days  or the last six years.,彼得迪曼蒂斯：这是我在过去6个月里 收集的一些视频。 如果是在6天，或者过去6年里 也可以轻易收集到类似的片段。
The point is that the news media  preferentially feeds us negative stories  because that's what our minds pay attention to.,重点是新闻媒体倾向于 向我们灌输负面信息。 因为我们的大脑特别容易关注这些。
And there's a very good reason for that.,当然大脑这样做是有很重要的理由。
"Every second of every day,  our senses bring in way too much data  than we can possibly process in our brains.",每时每刻， 我们的“传感器”收集大量的信息 多到我们的大脑处理不过来。
"And because nothing is more important to us  than survival,  the first stop of all of that data  is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe  called the amygdala.",而其中没有比与生存相关的信息 更重要的。 所有信息输入的第一站就是 颞叶上一个叫做大脑扁桃体的 非常原始的部分。
"Now the amygdala is our early warning detector,  our danger detector.",大脑扁桃体是我们的早期预警侦测器， 危险探测仪。
It sorts and scours through all of the information  looking for anything in the environment that might harm us.,它将所有信息分类并仔细查阅， 探测环境中任何可能的威胁。
"So given a dozen news stories,  we will preferentially look  at the negative news.",所以每当我们打开报纸， 就会不自觉地阅读 各种负面信息。
"And that old newspaper saying,  ""If it bleeds it leads,""  is very true.",那个过去有关报纸的说法： ”流血事件必上头条。“ 其实是很有道理的。
So given all of our digital devices  that are bringing all the negative news to us  it's no wonder that we're pessimistic.,而现在我们有各种数字化设备， 无时无刻地向我们 输送各种负面新闻。 难怪大家这么容易悲观。
It's no wonder that people think  that the world is getting worse.,难怪人们觉得 世界在倒退。
But perhaps that's not the case.,但事实或许
"Perhaps instead,  it's the distortions brought to us  of what's really going on.",并不是这样， 我们所接受的信息 是被扭曲的。
"Perhaps the tremendous progress we've made over the last century  by a series of forces  are, in fact, accelerating to a point  that we have the potential in the next three decades  to create a world of abundance.",我们的社会在上世纪 一系列事件的影响下 所经历的巨大的进步 正在不断加速， 事实上，这样的速度令我们在未来三十年中， 拥有创造一个富足的世界的可能性。
"Now I'm not saying  we don't have our set of problems --  climate crisis, species extinction,  water and energy shortage -- we surely do.",我并不是说 这些问题不存在－ 气候危机，物种灭绝， 水资源和能源短缺的情况都确实发生了。
"And as humans, we are far better  at seeing the problems way in advance,  but ultimately we knock them down.",作为人类，我们太擅长对 危机做出各种预估， 但最终我们会消除它们。
So let's look  at what this last century has been  to see where we're going.,让我们来回顾下 上个世纪发生了什么， 来了解我们正向着什么方向在前进。

And Charles Kenny  that global literacy has gone from 25 percent to over 80 percent  in the last 130 years.,还有查尔斯·肯尼提到 世界范围的识字率在过去的130年里从25％ 上升到了80％。

And many people forget this.,然而许多人忘记了这点。
And we keep setting our expectations higher and higher.,我们不断地把期望越定越高。
"In fact, we redefine what poverty means.",事实上，我们已经更改了“贫穷”的涵义。

"The wealthiest robber barons of the last century, the emperors on this planet,  could have never dreamed of such luxuries.",上世纪最富有的强盗大亨，这个星球上的帝王们， 永远都想象不到这样的奢侈生活。
"Underpinning much of this  is technology,  and of late,  exponentially growing technologies.",而这一切的基础 是科技。 和近代 指数式增长的科技。
"My good friend Ray Kurzweil  showed that any tool that becomes an information technology  jumps on this curve, on Moore's Law,  and experiences price performance doubling  every 12 to 24 months.",我的好朋友雷·库兹威尔 展示了任何信息科技的工具 都遵从这条曲线，即摩尔定律。 并经历每12到24个月 性价比翻一倍的增长。
That's why the cellphone in your pocket  is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster  than a supercomputer of the '70s.,这就是为什么你口袋里的行动电话 相比70年代的超级电脑要便宜 100万倍，而且还要快上1000倍
Now look at this curve.,再看这个曲线。
This is Moore's Law over the last hundred years.,这是过去几百年里的摩尔定律。
I want you to notice two things from this curve.,我想要大家注意这曲线所体现的2件事
"Number one, how smooth it is --  through good time and bad time, war time and peace time,  recession, depression and boom time.",第一，它非常的平滑－ 无论时代是好是坏，无论战争或和平， 经济衰退或增长。
This is the result of faster computers  being used to build faster computers.,这是因为更快的电脑被用来制造 更更快的电脑所产生的结果。
It doesn't slow for any of our grand challenges.,它不会因为我们面临的巨大挑战所延缓。
"And also, even though it's plotted  on a log curve on the left,  it's curving upwards.",尽管在左边 呈现出对数曲线 它也是仍然是向上弯曲。

"So in bringing back this childhood ritual,  you need to go out  and, in one chapter, take a picture of a flower  and then tag it.",所以我把这个孩子时候的仪式带了回来， 你需要走出去 在一个章节里，照一张花儿的照片 然后给它标记命名
"In another chapter, you need to take a picture of a piece of bark  and then tag that.",在另一个章节里，你需要照一张树皮的照片 然后标记它
And what happens  is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs  that you can then put up online.,接下来发生的就是 你实际上创造了一个数码的相片的收集 你可以把它放到网上
"A child in London puts up a picture of a fox  and says, ""Oh, I saw a fox today.""",一个在伦敦的孩子放上去了一张狐狸的照片 说，“哦，我今天看到了一只狐狸”
"A child in India says, ""I saw a monkey today.""",一个在印度的孩子说，“我今天看到了一只猴子”
And it creates this kind of social network  around a collection of digital photographs  that you've actually taken.,它创造出这样的一个社交网络， 围绕着这样一个 实际上是你照的数码相片的收集
"In the possibilities of linking together  magic, the earth and technology,  there are multiple possibilities.",有了这些魔法 地球和科技都联系起来的可能性 这里就会有更多种多样的可能性
"In the next book, we plan on having an interaction  where you take your iPad out with the video on  and through augmented reality,  you see this layer of animated pixies  appear on a houseplant that's outside your house.",在下本书中，我们计划一种互动 你用iPad的视频 通过增强现实， 你看这层是活泼乱动的精灵 出现在你房子外面的盆栽上
"At one point, your screen is filled up with leaves.",在某一点上，你的屏幕上布满了树叶
And so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away  and read the rest of the book.,所以你需要弄出风的声音将它们吹走 然后读书下面的部分
"We're moving, we're all moving here,  to a world where the forces of nature  come closer together to technology,  and magic and technology can come closer together.",我们在移动，移动到这里 到一个自然的力量和科技变得越来越近 的一个世界， 魔法和科技可以走得更近
We're harnessing energy from the sun.,我们利用太阳的能量
We're bringing our children and ourselves  closer to the natural world  and childhood love that we had  through the simple medium of a story.,我们把我们的孩子和我们自己 和自然世界拉得更近 和我们 通过一个简单的传媒故事 带来魔法和愉快，以及孩童时候的爱
Thank you.,谢谢
I would like to talk to you  about why many e-health projects fail.,我想和大家谈谈 众多电子医疗保健项目失败的原因
And I really think that the most important thing of it  is that we stopped listening to patients.,我想最重要的一点 是我们没有倾听病人的心声
And one of the things we did at Radboud University  is we appointed a chief listening officer.,我们在荷兰内梅亨大学做的一件事 就是委任了一名首席倾听官
"Not in a very scientific way --  she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea  and asks patients, family, relatives,  ""What's up?",不是以一种很科学的方式－ 她倒杯咖啡或者茶 问问病人，家庭，亲戚 “近来好啊？
"How could we help you?""",有什么需要我们帮助的？”
"And we think, we like to think,  that this is one of the major problems  but most of the e-health projects fail,  since we stopped listening.",我想，我们愿意认为 这就是导致 几乎所有电子医疗保健项目失败的 主要原因之一 即我们没有倾听
This is my WiFi scale. It's a very simple thing.,这是我的WiFi体重测量仪 是个很简单的玩意
"It's got one knob, on/off.",这有个开关
And every morning I hop on it.,每天早上我坐上去称重
"And yes, I've got a challenge,  as you might see.",哈不错，我给自己定了个目标值 你可以看到的
And I put my challenge on 95 kg.,我把体重目标值定为95kg
"But the thing is that it's made this simple  that whenever I hop on,  it sends my data through Google Health as well.",事实上整个操作非常简单 我一坐上去 它就把我的数据发送到谷歌健康
"And it's collected by my general practitioner as well,  so he can see what's my problem in weight,  not on the very moment  that I need cardiologic support or something like it,  but also looking backward.",同时我的全科医生也可以收到 然后他就能看看我的体重有什么问题 不是等到像心脏病发作 这样十万火急的时候才想到看体重 而是一路走来都会关注
But there's another thing.,但还有一点
"As some of you might know, I've got more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.",你们有些人可能知道 我在推特上有四千多粉丝
"So every morning  I hop on my WiFi scale  and before I'm in my car, people start talking to me,  ""I think you need a light lunch today, Lucien.""",所以每天早上 我用WiFi体重测量仪称重 在我上车之前 人们就开始跟我说话了 “我想你今天午饭还是就简吧，吕西安”
"But that's the nicest thing that could happen,  since this is peer pressure,  peer pressure used to help patients --  since this could be used for obesity,  it could be used  to stop smoking in patients.",但其实那再好不过了 因为这是同伴压力 同伴压力能帮助病人－ 它可以帮助治疗肥胖 可以帮助 戒烟
"But on the other hand, it also could be used  to get people from out of their chairs  and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity  to get more control of their health.",但是另外一方面，它也可以 把人们聚集到一起 参加一些类似游戏的活动 来更好地维护健康
"As of next week, it will soon be available.",下一周这个功能就要上马了
There will be this little blood pressure meter  connected to an iPhone or something or other.,届时会有一个像这样的小血压计 连接到智能手机或者其他设备上
"And people will be able, from their homes,  to take their blood pressure,  send it into their doctor  and eventually share it with others, for instance,  for over a hundred dollars.",然后人们便可在家中 测量血压 之后把数据发给他们的医生 同时也可同其他人分享 只要一百美元
"And this is the point where patients get into position  and can collect, not only their own control again,  be captain of their own ship,  but also can help us in health care  due to the challenges that we face,  like health care cost explosion,  doubled demand and things like that.",这就是关键之处，当患者各就各位 收集数据时，他们不仅能自我控制 亲自掌舵 还能帮助我们应付 医疗保健中面临的挑战 比如医疗费用剧增 或者需求成倍增加等等
Make techniques that are easy to use  and start with this to embrace patients in the team.,我们要让技术便于掌控 以鼓励已步入轨道的病人
"And you can do this with techniques like this,  but also by crowd-sourcing.",你可以通过这样的技术来实现 也可以将任务分派给普通大众
And one of the things we did  I would like to share with you introduced by a little video.,今天我将通过 一个短片来向各位展示我们做的一个项目
We've all got navigation controls in our car.,我们车里都有导航装置
We maybe even [have] it in our cellphone.,甚至手机里也有
We know perfectly where all the ATMs are  about the city of Maastricht.,我们知道马斯特里赫特市 所有ATM的位置
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are.,也知道所有加油站的位置
"And sure, we could find fast food chains.",当然还有快餐店
But where would be the nearest AED  to help this patient?,但是最近的能拯救患者的 自动体外除颤器在哪儿？
We asked around and nobody knew.,我们到处问也没有人知道
Nobody knew where the nearest life-saving AED  was to be obtained right now.,没人知道的能救命的自动体外除颤器 现在能找到了
"So what we did, we crowdsourced The Netherlands.",我们将属于整个荷兰的任务派发给群众
"We set up a website  and asked the crowd, ""If you see an AED,  please submit it, tell us where it is,  tell us when it's open,""  since sometimes in office hours sometimes it's closed, of course.",我们建了一个网站 告诉人们，“如果你看到一个自动体外除颤器 就请在网上标出它的位置 并备注开放时间” 备注是因为它不一定24小时都开放
"And over 10,000 AEDs already in The Netherlands  already have been submitted.",在荷兰已经有一万多个AED 被标注上了
The next step we took was to find the applications for it.,下一步就是开发相应的应用程序
And we built an iPad application.,我们开发了一个iPad应用
"We made an application for Layar, augmented reality,  to find these AEDs.",一个Layar的应用，扩增实境 来寻找AED
"And whenever you are in a city like Maastricht and somebody collapses,  you can use your iPhone,  and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cellphone,  to find the nearest AED  which can save lives.",如果你在马斯特里赫特市 看到有人倒下了 你可以用iPhone 几周之内微软手机也可以了 找到最近的AED 来拯救生命
"And as of today,  we would like to introduce this, not only as AED4EU,  which is what the product is called,  but also AED4US.",今天 我想介绍的，不仅仅是AED4U 这是那个产品的名字 还有aed4.us
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level.,我们打算将这项目推广到全世界
"And [we're] asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world,  colleague universities, to help us  to find and work and act like a hub  to crowd-source all these AEDs all around the world.",在这里我们也呼吁世界各地的同事 和大学来帮我们 让我们万众一心 一起将世界各地的AED标识出来
"That whenever you're on holiday and somebody collapses,  might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you,  you can find this.",这样当你假日外出看见有人昏倒了 也许是你的亲人或者只是路人 你就能找到AED
The other thing we would like to ask  is of companies also all over the world  that will be able to help us validate these AEDs.,在这里我们还想呼吁 世界上的各个公司 能帮我们验证这些AED
"These might be courier services  or cable guys for instance,  just to see whether the AED that's submitted  still is in place.",譬如，或许让快递员 或者电报员 去看看被标识的AED 是不是还在那个位置
"So please help us on this one  and try to make not only health a little bit better, but take control of it.",所以请在这一项目上帮助我们 让我们不仅更健康，并且能将其掌握，胸有成竹
Thank you.,谢谢大家
I'm here to share my photography.,今天我想在此跟大家分享一下我的摄影作品
Or is it photography?,或者说，这张也是摄影作品么？
"Because, of course, this is a photograph  that you can't take with your camera.",因为，这显然是一张照片 但却是你用相机拍不出来的
"Yet, my interest in photography started  as I got my first digital camera  at the age of 15.",然而，我对摄影的兴趣 始于我拿到第一个数码相机后 那时候我15岁
"It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,  but it was a bit different,  because using the camera,  the process was in the planning instead.",这里面夹杂了我之前对绘画的热爱 但是有一点不一样 因为使用照相机的时候 整个过程已经提前计划好了
"And when you take a photograph with a camera,  the process ends when you press the trigger.",当你拿起相机拍照 当你摁下快门的时候整个过程也就结束了
So to me it felt like photography was more about  being at the right place and the right time.,所以在我看来摄影更注重 适当的拍摄地点和时间
I felt like anyone could do that.,我觉得任何人都可以做这件事
"So I wanted to create something different,  something where the process starts  when you press the trigger.",所以我想做点特别的 特别之处就在于当你摁下快门时 整个过程才刚刚开始
Photos like this:  construction going on along a busy road.,比如这张照片： 一条繁忙的公路旁边正在进行施工
But it has an unexpected twist.,（题材平凡，）但手法出人意料
"And despite that,  it retains a level of realism.",尽管如此 它仍然保留了一份现实主义感
"Or photos like these --  both dark and colorful,  but all with a common goal  of retaining the level of realism.",或者像这样的照片 既有暗色也有彩色 但是其目的都是 为了保留一份现实主义感
"When I say realism,  I mean photo-realism.",我说的现实主义 指的是照片的现实主义
"Because, of course,  it's not something you can capture really,  but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow  as a photograph.",因为这的确 不是你可以真正抓住的东西 但是我总想让它看起来像是可以用某种方式 被抓拍下来一样
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think  to figure out the trick.,这些照片需要你能够快速 找出它们背后的技巧
So it's more about capturing an idea  than about capturing a moment really.,所以更注重的是捕捉一个灵感 而不是捕捉一个真实存在的瞬间
But what's the trick  that makes it look realistic?,但是使这些照片看起来 很写实的技巧是什么呢？
Is it something about the details  or the colors?,是关于细节？ 还是关于色彩？
Is it something about the light?,还是关于光线？
What creates the illusion?,是什么促成了这种幻觉？
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.,有时候不同的视角造成不同的幻觉
"But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world  and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.",但最终，还是要归结于我们如何理解这个世界 以及这种理解如何在一个二维空间得以体现
"It's not really what is realistic,  it's what we think looks realistic really.",这并不是关于什么是真的 而是关于我们认为什么看起来像是真的
So I think the basics  are quite simple.,所以我认为这些基本原理 其实很简单
I just see it as a puzzle of reality  where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together  to create alternate reality.,我把它看做是现实世界的一个拼图 在这里你可以把现实世界的不同片段拼凑起来 创造另一种真实
And let me show you a simple example.,让我来举个简单的例子
"Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,  something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.",这里有三个完全可想象到并真实存在的物体 我们可以在现实的三维世界里找到它们
"But combined in a certain way,  they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,  like it could exist.",但若将这些物体用某种方式组合起来 就可以创造出视觉上依然是三维的物体 就好像它是会存在的
"But at the same time, we know it can't.",但是同时我们很清楚它不可能存在
"So we trick our brains,  because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact  that it doesn't really make sense.",就这样我们骗了自己的大脑 因为大脑就是不肯接受 这个物体其实并不存在这一事实
with combining photographs.,组合照片
It's just really about combining different realities.,也是如此 确实只是把不同的现实画面组合起来
"So the things that make a photograph look realistic,  I think it's the things that we don't even think about,  the things all around us in our daily lives.",所以使一张照片看起来逼真的事物 是那些我们平时甚至不会去想 但在日常生活中随处可见的东西
"But when combining photographs,  this is really important to consider,  because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.",但是当我们组合照片的时候 这点就值得我们着重思考了 否则它看起来就会别扭
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow  to achieve a realistic result.,我想说的是我们要遵守三个简单的原则 为了达到一个逼真的效果
"As you can see, these images aren't really special.",你们看，这些图像并不特别
"But combined, they can create something like this.",但是组合起来，它们就可以创造出这样的画面
So the first rule is that photos combined  should have the same perspective.,所以第一原则就是所有被组合的照片 都展现同样的视角
"Secondly, photos combined  should have the same type of light.",第二，被组合的照片 还要有相同的光线
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --  shot at the same height and in the same type of light.,这两张照片都符合这两样要求 它们都摄于相同的拍摄高度和相同的光线下
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish  where the different images begin and end  by making it seamless.,第三个原则是要让人难以分辨 这些不同照片的衔接点 使衔接看起来天衣无缝
Make it impossible to say  how the image actually was composed.,使任何人都道不出 这图片是如何创作而成的
"So by matching color, contrast and brightness  in the borders between the different images,  adding photographic defects  like depth of field,  desaturated colors and noise,  we erase the borders between the different images  and make it look like one single image,  despite the fact that one image  can contain hundreds of layers basically.",通过匹配不同照片边缘的 色彩，对比度以及亮度 再加入一下摄影瑕疵 比如视野的深度 去饱和的色彩和噪音 我们可以除去不同照片之间的边界 使其看起来就像是一张单一的照片 即使一张照片 可包含上百个图层
So here's another example.,这里还有一个例子
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape  and the lower part is what's manipulated.,有人可能认为这只是一张风景图 下面的部分是处理过的
But this image is actually entirely composed  of photographs from different locations.,但是这张照片其实整个都是 由不同地方拍摄的很多照片组合起来的
"I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place  than to find a place,  because then you don't need to compromise  with the ideas in your head.",我个人认为创造一个地方比找到一个地方 要容易一些 因为你不用 与自己大脑的想法妥协
But it does require a lot of planning.,但是这确实需要很多规划
"And getting this idea during winter,  I knew that I had several months to plan it,  to find the different locations  for the pieces of the puzzle basically.",去年冬天产生这个想法时 我知道我有几个月的时间去规划这件事 基本上要到不同的地点 找这一拼图所需的图片
"So for example,  the fish was captured on a fishing trip.",比如 这条鱼摄于一次垂钓航行
The shores are from a different location.,海岸拍摄于另一个地点
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.,水下的部分摄于一个采石场
"And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red  to make it look more Swedish.",对了，我还把岛上的房子调成红色的了 使它看起来更具瑞典风
"So to achieve a realistic result,  I think it comes down to planning.",为了达到一个逼真的效果 我认为最重要的就是规划
"It always starts with a sketch, an idea.",总是会先出现一个大概的构思和想法
Then it's about combining the different photographs.,然后就是组合不同的照片
And here every piece is very well planned.,这里每一个图片都是经过仔细规划的
"And if you do a good job capturing the photos,  the result can be quite beautiful  and also quite realistic.",如果你能抓拍到很好的照片， 效果会很美。 而且也很逼真
"So all the tools are out there,  and the only thing that limits us  is our imagination.",所以其实所有的工具都在那 唯一限制我们的 是我们的想象力
Thank you.,谢谢大家
"Because I usually take the role  of trying to explain to people  how wonderful the new technologies  that are coming along are going to be,  and I thought that, since I was among friends here,  I would tell you what I really think  and try to look back and try to understand  what is really going on here  with these amazing jumps in technology  that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.",由于我经常 向人们解释 即将到来的新科技 将会多么的美妙 我想既然我跟各位朋友们一起在这 就让我来说说我真正的想法 并试着回顾和理解 这到底是如何发生的 有了这些科技上的惊人进步。 科技的进步似乎快到我们根本无法赶上它的脚步。
So I'm going to start out  by showing just one very boring technology slide.,让我先从这开始 一页很无趣的科技幻灯片。
"And then, so if you can just turn on the slide that's on.",然后可以开始放幻灯片了。
This is just a random slide  that I picked out of my file.,这只是我从我的文件中 随机挑选出的一张。
"What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide,  but the general form of it.",我想要你们看的并不是它的细节， 而是它的总体形式。
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing  about the power of RISC microprocessors  versus the power of local area networks.,这个是我们做的 关于RISC精简指令集微处理器功率 与本地网路功率分析的幻灯片。
"And the interesting thing about it  is that this slide,  like so many technology slides that we're used to,  is a sort of a straight line  on a semi-log curve.",有趣的是 这页幻灯片 就像很多我们所熟悉的幻灯片一样， 是半对数曲线图 上的一条直线。
"In other words, every step here  represents an order of magnitude  in performance scale.",也就是这里的每一层， 代表了性能程度 大小的一级。
And this is a new thing  that we talk about technology  on semi-log curves.,在半对数曲线图上 讨论科技， 这很新鲜。
Something really weird is going on here.,这其中有点奇特。
And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.,这基本上是我接下来要说的。
"So, if you could bring up the lights.",麻烦开一下灯。
"If you could bring up the lights higher,  because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.",请把灯开亮点， 因为我要用张纸。
Now why do we draw technology curves  in semi-log curves?,为什么我们要用对数曲线 描绘科技曲线呢？
"Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve  where, let's say, this is years,  this is time of some sort,  and this is whatever measure of the technology  that I'm trying to graph,  the graphs look sort of silly.",嗯，答案是，如果我用普通曲线画， 我们说，这是年份， 这是某个时间， 这是我准备画的 科技的某种测量值， 这图看起来有点傻。
They sort of go like this.,就有点像是这样。
And they don't tell us much.,而且并没有提供什么资讯。
"Now if I graph, for instance,  some other technology, say transportation technology,  on a semi-log curve,  it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.",现在，如果我画，比如说， 另一种技术，像是交通运输， 在半对数曲线上， 它看起来很蠢，会像条很平的线。
"But when something like this happens,  things are qualitatively changing.",但是如果出现像这种 质变的情况。
"So if transportation technology  was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,  then the day after tomorrow,  I would be able to get in a taxi cab  and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.",如果交通运输技术 进步地像微处理器技术一样快的话， 那，后天 我就能搭一辆出租车 然后在30秒内到东京。
It's not moving like that. And there's nothing precedented  in the history of technology development  of this kind of self-feeding growth  where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.,但它并没有进步得那么快。 在科技发展历史中 也没有任何 这种自给自足， 每几年程度翻倍增长的先例。
"Now the question that I'd like to ask is,  if you look at these exponential curves,  they don't go on forever.",现在我想要问的是， 如果你观察这些指数曲线， 它们并非永远的持续下去。
Things just can't possibly keep changing  as fast as they are.,事物不可能一直 改变得那么快。
One of two things is going to happen.,两件事会发生，
"Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,  until something totally different comes along,  or maybe it's going to do this.",要么它会变成像这样典型的S曲线 直到完全不同的情况出现。 或是会变成这样。
That's about all it can do.,这就是所有可能。
"Now I'm an optimist,  so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.",现在我是个乐观主义者， 所以我觉得它很有可能就会变成这样。
"If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now  is a transition.",如果是这样，意味着我们目前所在的 是过渡阶段。
We're sort of on this line  in a transition from the way the world used to be  to some new way that the world is.,我们似乎在这条线上， 在世界从过去 到将来的转变中。
"And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,  is what's this new way that the world is?",所有我要问的，我一直在问自己的， 就是这世界未来道路在哪？
What's that new state that the world is heading toward?,它趋向的新时代是什么样的？
"Because the transition seems very, very confusing  when we're right in the middle of it.",由于这个变化似乎非常，非常迷惑人， 当我们正处于其中时。
"Now when I was a kid growing up,  the future was kind of the year 2000,  and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.",我小时候，在长大过程中 未来就像是2000年， 人们都在讨论2000年将会发生什么。
"Now here's a conference  in which people talk about the future,  and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.",现在这个会议上， 大家在讨论未来， 而且你能发现这未来指的还是那个“2000年”。
It's about as far as we go out.,这就是我们能达到的程度。
"So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking  one year per year  for my whole lifetime.",换句话说，在我一生中 未来正在 逐年缩短。
Now I think that the reason  is because we all feel  that something's happening there.,我想原因是 我们都感觉到 正在发生些什么。
That transition is happening. We can all sense it.,变化正在发生。我们都能察觉到。
"And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense  to think out 30, 50 years  because everything's going to be so different  that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing  just doesn't make any sense at all.",我们知道去考虑那未来的三、五十年 已经没什么意义了， 因为每件事都将如此不同 以至于推测将来 不再有意义。
"So what I would like to talk about  is what that could be,  what that transition could be that we're going through.",所以我要聊聊 那会是怎样， 我们正在经历的转变会是怎样。
Now in order to do that  I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff  that really has nothing to do  with technology and computers.,为达到这个目的， 我得介绍一堆东西 它们与 科技和电脑完全无关。
Because I think the only way to understand this  is to really step back  and take a long time scale look at things.,因为我决定理解这个的唯一方法 就是回顾过去 拉长时间轴去看。
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on  is the time scale of life on Earth.,而我所要看的时间轴 是以地球上生命的时间跨度来看。
So I think this picture makes sense  if you look at it a few billion years at a time.,我想这幅图合理了 如果你每次从几十亿年跨度来看。
"So if you go back  about two and a half billion years,  the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock  with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.",所以如果你回溯个 大概25亿年， 地球这么大，贫瘠的大块石头 上面浮着些化学物质。
"And if you look at the way  that the chemicals got organized,  we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.",要是观察 这些化学物质怎样组合的， 我们开始弄明白它们怎么形成的。
"And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand  about how it started with RNA,  but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,  which is that, at that time,  there were little drops of oil floating around  with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.",我想有些理论是从理解 生命怎样从核糖核酸演变开始， 但是我想讲一个生命的简单故事， 就是，在那个时候， 有一滴滴的油四处浮动， 里面有各种不同化学成分组合。
And some of those drops of oil  had a particular combination of chemicals in them  which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside  and grow the drops of oil.,有些油滴 里面含有特殊的化学构成 这导致它们可以从外界聚集化学物质 并慢慢变大。
And those that were like that  started to split and divide.,像这样的油滴 又开始分化，分离。
"And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,  those little drops of oil.",最原始的那些在某种程度上形成了细胞， 这些小小的油滴。
"But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,  because every one of them  was a little random recipe of chemicals.",但目前为止这些油滴不是真正活着的，在我们现在看来， 因为每一个 都是化学物质的随机合成。
"And every time it divided,  they got sort of unequal division  of the chemicals within them.",每分裂一次， 都不是平均分布 内部的化学物。
And so every drop was a little bit different.,所以每个油滴都有点不同。
"In fact, the drops that were different in a way  that caused them to be better  at incorporating chemicals around them,  grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.",实际上，油滴不同的方式 是让它们能更好地 集成周围的化合物， 长得更大，吸收更多，分裂更多。
"So those tended to live longer,  get expressed more.",所以它们会活得更长， 表现得更多。
"Now that's sort of just a very simple  chemical form of life,  but when things got interesting  was when these drops  learned a trick about abstraction.",这就有点像个很简单的 生命的化学形式， 但过程变得有趣 是当这些油滴 学会了一个提供资讯的技巧时。
"Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand,  these little drops learned to write down information.",不知怎么用我们不能完全理解的方式， 这些小油滴学会了记录资讯。
They learned to record the information  that was the recipe of the cell  onto a particular kind of chemical  called DNA.,它们学会把 细胞形成的秘诀 记录到一种特殊物质上， 叫做去氧核糖核酸。
"So in other words, they worked out,  in this mindless sort of evolutionary way,  a form of writing that let them write down what they were,  so that that way of writing it down could get copied.",也就是说，它们想出了， 以这种随性的进化方式， 可以写下它们基因信息的记录方式， 以便这种记录方式能被复制。
The amazing thing is that that way of writing  seems to have stayed steady  since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.,惊奇的是这种记录方式 似乎可以保持稳定 由于它25亿年前演化出来的。
"In fact the recipe for us, our genes,  is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.",实际上我们，我们基因的组成 就是完全一样的代码，一样的记录方式。
"In fact, every living creature is written  in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.",实际上，任何生物都是 用完全一样的字母和代码记录下来的。
"In fact, one of the things that I did  just for amusement purposes  is we can now write things in this code.",实际上，我所做的 仅是为了娱乐效果的一件事 就是我们能用这个代码记录事件。
"And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,  which I try not to let the security people see at airports.",我这有100微克的白粉， 我尽力不让机场安检人员发现它们。
But this has in it --  what I did is I took this code --  the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --  and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA  and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.,不过这里面有代码 我所做的是我拿着这代码 它里面有我们用来标记它的标准字母， 然后我把我的名片写到一条去氧核糖核酸上 再放大10到22倍。
"So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,  I have plenty for everyone in the room,  and, in fact, everyone in the world,  and it's right here.",所以如果有人需要数百万份我的名片， 我有足够多份给在座每个人， 甚至是全世界每个人， 就在这。
"If I had really been a egotist,  I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.",要是我是个自大的人， 我就会把它放到病毒里散布到屋子中。
So what was the next step?,所以下一步是什么？
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.,记录去氧核糖核酸是有趣的一步。
And that caused these cells --  that kept them happy for another billion years.,它导致了细胞的形成—— 让它们又高兴了几十亿年。
"But then there was another really interesting step  where things became completely different,  which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,  so that they began to get communities of cells.",不过还有个很有趣的环节 事情开始变得完全不同， 那就是这些细胞开始交换和交流资讯， 从而形成细胞团体。
"I don't know if you know this,  but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.",我不知道你们是否知道这个， 细菌实际上就可以交换去氧核糖核酸。
"Now that's why, for instance,  antibiotic resistance has evolved.",这就是为什么，比如， 演变出抗菌免疫。
"Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,  and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information  with other bacteria,  and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,  because bacteria communicate.",有些细菌知道怎么远离青霉素， 然后它创造它这点去氧核糖核酸资讯， 并在别的细菌中到处游走， 现在我们有很多对青霉素免疫的细菌了， 因为细菌会交流资讯。
"Now what this communication allowed  was communities to form  that, in some sense, were in the same boat together;  they were synergistic.",这样，这些交流致使 群落的形成， 在某种意义上，它们在同一条船上了； 它们是协作的。
"So they survived  or they failed together,  which means that if a community was very successful,  all the individuals in that community  were repeated more  and they were favored by evolution.",因此它们一起幸存下来 或者一起死去， 也就是说如果一个群落成功了， 所有群落里的个体 都能复制更多， 进化得更有利。
"Now the transition point happened  when these communities got so close  that, in fact, they got together  and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community  together on one string of DNA.",于是，转换点到了， 当这些族群很亲近时， 事实上，它们聚集到一起 并决定在一条去氧核糖核酸上 写下整个族群的成分谱。
And so the next stage that's interesting in life  took about another billion years.,生命中下一个有趣的阶段 又要几十亿年。
"And at that stage,  we have multi-cellular communities,  communities of lots of different types of cells,  working together as a single organism.",在这个时期， 有多细胞族群， 就是有很多种不同细胞的群落， 作为有机体一起合作。
"And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.",实际上，我们就是这样的多细胞族群。
We have lots of cells  that are not out for themselves anymore.,我们有很多细胞， 它们不再是只为自己存活。
"Your skin cell is really useless  without a heart cell, muscle cell,  a brain cell and so on.",皮肤细胞根本没用， 要是没有心脏细胞，肌肉细胞， 脑细胞等等。
"So these communities began to evolve  so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place  was no longer a cell,  but a community which we call an organism.",所以这些族群开始进化 这样发生有趣的进化的 不再仅仅是单一细胞。 而是我们称为有机体的族群。
Now the next step that happened  is within these communities.,接下来发生 就是在这些族群中。
"These communities of cells,  again, began to abstract information.",这些细胞群落， 再次，开始提取资讯。
And they began building very special structures  that did nothing but process information within the community.,它们开始构建非常特别的 专门处理群落内资讯的结构。
And those are the neural structures.,这些就是神经结构。
So neurons are the information processing apparatus  that those communities of cells built up.,所以神经元是 这些细胞群建立的资讯处理仪器。
"And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community  and special structures  that were responsible for recording,  understanding, learning information.",实际上，群落里开始出现专家 以及特殊结构 负责记录， 理解，学习资讯。
And that was the brains and the nervous system  And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.,这就是这些细胞群的 大脑和神经系统。 这给了它们进化的有利条件。
"Because at that point,  an individual --  learning could happen  within the time span of a single organism,  instead of over this evolutionary time span.",因为这样的话， 对每个个体—— 学习可以发生 在单个有机体的时间跨度内， 而不是整个进化时间跨度。
"So an organism could, for instance,  learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit  because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.",所以一个有机体能够，比如说， 学会不吃某种水果 因为它不好吃而且上次吃的觉得恶心。
"That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,  whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,  that would have had to be learned evolutionarily  over hundreds of thousands of years  by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.",这可以发生在一个单个有机体的一生中， 然后在这种特殊信息处理结构建成前， 这得要进化学习 千万年， 通过吃了这种水果前仆后继死去的个体。
"So that nervous system,  the fact that they built these special information structures,  tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.",所以神经系统， 生物组建这种特殊结构的事实， 极大地加速了进化的进程。
Because evolution could now happen within an individual.,因为至此进化可以在个体中发生了。
It could happen in learning time scales.,它能发生在学习的时间跨度内。
"But then what happened  was the individuals worked out,  of course, tricks of communicating.",但是接下来发生的 是每个个体发现了， 当然，交流的秘诀。
"And for example,  the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.",比如说， 我们所知道的最精密的版本就是人类语言。
It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.,想想看，这真是个奇妙的发明。
"Here I have a very complicated, messy,  confused idea in my head.",我脑子里有个很复杂，混乱， 疑惑的想法。
"I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,  and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head  that bears some analogy to it.",我坐在这，基本上就是吐字发声， 希望在你们头脑里建立一个类似的混乱 跟它有点类似的想法。
"But we're taking something very complicated,  turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,  and producing something very complicated in your brain.",但是我们正在把很复杂的东西 转化成声音，一连串的声音， 并在你们大脑产生很复杂的东西。
So this allows us now  to begin to start functioning  as a single organism.,所以现在这推动我们 开始运作 作为单个有机体。
"And so, in fact, what we've done  is we, humanity,  have started abstracting out.",所以，实际上，我们已经完成的 就是我们，人类， 开始抽离出来。
"We're going through the same levels  that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --  abstracting out our methods of recording,  presenting, processing information.",我们正在经历多细胞有机体经历的 相同的阶段—— 提取我们记录， 展示，处理资讯的方式。
"So for example, the invention of language  was a tiny step in that direction.",比如说，语言的发明 就是这个方向上很小一步。
"Telephony, computers,  videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on  are all our specialized mechanisms  that we've now built within our society  for handling that information.",电话，电脑， 影碟，光碟等等 都是我们的特殊机制， 我们正在社会里构建 用来处理资讯的机制。
"And it all connects us together  into something  that is much bigger  and much faster  and able to evolve  So now, evolution can take place  on a scale of microseconds.",这些都是把我们联系在一起， 变的 比我们之前 更大， 更快， 更有能力进化。 所以，现在进化可以发生在 微妙的时间跨度级上。
And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example  where he sort of did a little bit of evolution  on the Convolution program right before your eyes.,你们看过泰伊的那个进化的小例子 它好像就在你们眼前的卷积程式上 展现了一点进化了。
So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.,所以现在我们再次加快时间跨度。
So the first steps of the story that I told you about  took a billion years a piece.,我讲的故事的第一步 每一步花费了几十亿年。
"And the next steps,  like nervous systems and brains,  took a few hundred million years.",下一步， 像神经系统和大脑， 消耗几百万年。
"Then the next steps, like language and so on,  took less than a million years.",再接下来，像语言等等， 需要不到一百万年。
"And these next steps, like electronics,  seem to be taking only a few decades.",再下一步，像电子器件， 仿佛只要几十年。
"The process is feeding on itself  and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --  when something reinforces its rate of change.",这个过程是自给自足， 并且变成，我猜，应该自我催化描述更合适—— 当事物加快改变的速度。
"The more it changes, the faster it changes.",变化越多，变化就越快。
And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.,我想这就是我们在这看到的激增曲线。
We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.,我们看到这个过程回馈到自己。
"Now I design computers for a living,  and I know that the mechanisms  that I use to design computers  would be impossible  without recent advances in computers.",我现在工作就是自己设计电脑， 我知道用来设计电脑的 这些机制 不可能存在， 要是没有近期电脑的进步。
"So right now, what I do  is I design objects at such complexity  that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.",现在，我做的 是设计复杂到 不可能从传统意义上设计的物体。
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.,我不知道连接机器上每个电晶体的作用。
There are billions of them.,有几十亿电晶体。
"Instead, what I do  and what the designers at Thinking Machines do  is we think at some level of abstraction  and then we hand it to the machine  and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,  much farther and faster than we could ever do.",实际上，我所做的 思考机器的设计师们做的， 我们认为是为某种程度的资讯抽取， 然后把它传给机器 而机器把它运用到超出我们所能做的范围， 而且比我们从前所做的更深远更快。
"And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods  that we don't quite even understand.",实际上，有时候它采用的方法 我们并不很懂。
One method that's particularly interesting  that I've been using a lot lately  is evolution itself.,有个尤其有趣 我最近一直在用的 就是进化本身。
So what we do  is we put inside the machine  a process of evolution  that takes place on the microsecond time scale.,我们做的就是 在机器里 放入一个进化进程， 这个进程在微妙时间跨度上就能发生。
"So for example,  in the most extreme cases,  we can actually evolve a program  by starting out with random sequences of instructions.",比如， 大部分极端情况下， 我们实际上能 通过从随机的指令序列开始进化一个程式。
"Say, ""Computer, would you please make  a hundred million random sequences of instructions.",说“电脑，请你产生 一亿随机指令序列。
"Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,  run all of those programs,  and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted.""",现在请你运行所有这些随机指令列， 运行所有程式， 并选出最接近我想要的。”
"So in other words, I define what I wanted.",也就是说，我定义我要什么。
"Let's say I want to sort numbers,  as a simple example I've done it with.",假设我需要分类资料， 这是个我用它试验过的简单例子。
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.,找到最接近资料分类的程式。
"So of course, random sequences of instructions  are very unlikely to sort numbers,  so none of them will really do it.",当然，随机的指令序列 非常不可能分类资料， 所以它们中没有一个能完成。
"But one of them, by luck,  may put two numbers in the right order.",但是中间有一个，运气很好， 可能会把两个数按顺序排列。
"And I say, ""Computer,  would you please now take the 10 percent  of those random sequences that did the best job.",我说，“电脑， 请你现在选出序列中百分之十 完成得最好的。
Save those. Kill off the rest.,保存这些。删掉其他的。
And now let's reproduce  the ones that sorted numbers the best.,现在来复制 资料分类得最好的这些。
"And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination  analogous to sex.""",以类似交配的重组过程 来复制它们。
"Take two programs and they produce children  by exchanging their subroutines,  and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.",取两个程式 交换它们的副程式让它们产生子女， 这些子女继承了两个程式副程式的特征。
So I've got now a new generation of programs  that are produced by combinations  of the programs that did a little bit better job.,所以我得到新一代的 由组合做的比较好的程式 而产生的程式。
"Say, ""Please repeat that process.""",说，“请重复这个过程。”
Score them again.,再做一次。
Introduce some mutations perhaps.,可能引入一些突变。
And try that again and do that for another generation.,再试一次并用在新的一代上。
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.,这一代上每个程式只需要几毫秒。
"So I can do the equivalent  of millions of years of evolution on that  or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.",所以我在电脑上用几分钟 能做等同于 几百万年的进化过程， 或者，情况复杂时，在几小时内完成。
"At the end of that, I end up with programs  that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.",结束时，我得到 绝对完美的分类资料的程式。
"In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient  than programs I could have ever written by hand.",实际上，这些程式比我手写的 任何程式都要有效率。
"Now if I look at those programs,  I can't tell you how they work.",现在，如果我读这些程式， 我说不出它们怎么工作的。
I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.,我尝试过阅读并且解释它们如何工作的。
"They're obscure, weird programs.",它们很抽象，奇怪。
But they do the job.,但是它们能完成任务。
"And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job  because they come from a line  of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.",实际上，我知道，我很有信心，它们能完成任务 因为它们来自于一行 上千万能完成认为的程式。
"In fact, their life depended on doing the job.",事实上，它们的生命就是靠着这工作。
"I was riding in a 747  with Marvin Minsky once,  and he pulls out this card and says, ""Oh look. Look at this.",我曾经有一次 和马文·明斯基一起坐747， 他拿出一张卡，说，“看，看这。
"It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts  working together to make you a safe flight.'  Doesn't that make you feel confident?""",这上面说，‘本飞机有很多精密部件 协作，保障你飞行安全。’ 这是不是让你很有信心？”
"In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well  when it gets complicated.",事实上，我们知道工程过程复杂化 并不能很好工作。
So we're beginning to depend on computers  to do a process that's very different than engineering.,所以我们开始依赖电脑 来做与工程有很大不同的一个过程。
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity  than normal engineering lets us produce.,它能让我们生产出 比普通工程能生产的更复杂的东西。
"And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.",然而，我们还不明白它的选择。
"So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.",从某种意义上说，电脑比我们超前。
We're now using those programs  to make much faster computers  so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.,我们现在正用这些程式 创造更快的电脑 以便能更快地运行这个进程。
So it's feeding back on itself.,所以它是自我回馈的。
The thing is becoming faster  and that's why I think it seems so confusing.,这正变得更快， 这也是为什么我觉得电脑似乎很让人摸不清。
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.,由于所有这些技术都回馈给自己。
We're taking off.,我们正在起飞。
And what we are is we're at a point in time  which is analogous to when single-celled organisms  were turning into multi-celled organisms.,我们正是在时间的某一点， 这一点类似于单细胞有机体 正转变成多细胞机体的时刻。
So we're the amoebas  and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating.,我们就像变形虫。 搞不清自己正在创造的是什么东西。
We're right at that point of transition.,我们正在转折点上。
But I think that there really is something coming along after us.,不过我认为一定有跟随着我们的东西。
I think it's very haughty of us  to think that we're the end product of evolution.,我想它是很崇拜我们的， 认为我们是进化的终极产物。
And I think all of us here  are a part of producing  whatever that next thing is.,我认为我们这所有人 都是繁衍的一部分， 无论下一步是什么。
"So lunch is coming along,  and I think I will stop at that point,  before I get selected out.",午饭时间快到了， 趁我还没被选走， 我想我就在这里结束。
I think we have to do something  about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change.,我觉得在当今的医学文化中， 有一部份文化必须要开始改变。
"And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me.",而这个改变可以从一个医生开始，那就是我。
And maybe I've been around long enough  that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige  to be able to do that.,或许是因为我已经行医多年， 我可以承受放弃一些虚无的名利 来开始这样的改变。
"Before I actually begin the meat of my talk,  let's begin with a bit of baseball.",在进入主题之前， 让我们先谈谈棒球吧。
"Hey, why not?",为什么不呢？
"We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series.",常规赛季就快结束，世界职业棒球大赛即将开始。
"We all love baseball, don't we?",我们都喜爱棒球，不是吗？
Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics.,棒球的世界中充斥着成千上百种
And there's hundreds of them.,让人咋舌的统计数据。
"""Moneyball"" is about to come out, and it's all about statistics  and using statistics to build a great baseball team.",即将上映的电影 “点球成金”，便是完全关于统计数据， 以及如何在这些数据的基础上建造一个伟大的球队。
I'm going to focus on one stat  that I hope a lot of you have heard of.,我想讲一个 我希望大家都听说过的数据，
It's called batting average.,叫做击球率。
"So we talk about a 300, a batter who bats 300.",当我们说一名挥棒球员的击球率为三成的时候，
"That means that ballplayer batted safely, hit safely  three times out of 10 at bats.",我们是指这位球员的打击非常稳定， 每十次种就会有三次安打。
"That means hit the ball into the outfield,  it dropped, it didn't get caught,  and whoever tried to throw it to first base didn't get there in time  and the runner was safe.",安打意味着球会被击中并被打入外野， 而且并不会被立刻接杀， 球也不会在跑者成功上到一垒之前 被及时的传回。
Three times out of 10.,十次中有三次安打。
Do you know what they call a 300 hitter  in Major League Baseball?,各位知道棒球大联盟如何评论 这些击球率上了三成的球员吗？
"Good, really good,  maybe an all-star.",很棒，非常棒， 明星球员一般的棒。
Do you know what they call  a 400 baseball hitter?,各位知道他们又是如何称呼一位 击球率有着四成，
"That's somebody who hit, by the way,  four times safely out of every 10.",也就是每十次打击 就会打出四个安打的球员吗。
Legendary --  as in Ted Williams legendary --  the last Major League Baseball player  to hit over 400 during a regular season.,是传奇 -- 像泰德. 威廉斯那样的传奇-- 他是棒球大联盟里最后一个在常规赛中 拥有超过四成击球率的球员。
"Now let's take this back into my world of medicine  where I'm a lot more comfortable,  or perhaps a bit less comfortable  after what I'm going to talk to you about.",现在让我们回到我的世界 - 医疗领域。 这个领域我比较熟悉， 但我接下来要说的 却让我有些困扰。
Suppose you have appendicitis  and you're referred to a surgeon  who's batting 400 on appendectomies.,假设你得了阑尾炎， 然后你被推荐给了一位 在阑尾移除手术中有着四成“击球率”的外科医生。
"Somehow this isn't working out, is it?",这听起来怪怪的，对吧？
Now suppose you live  in a certain part of a certain remote place  and you have a loved one  who has blockages in two coronary arteries  and your family doctor refers that loved one to a cardiologist  who's batting 200 on angioplasties.,又假设你住在 某一个较为偏远的地区， 而你所爱的人的 两条冠状动脉都被堵塞。 你的家庭医生将她推荐给了一位在血管成形手术上 有着两成“击球率”的心脏科医师。
"But, but, you know what?",但是，等等，你知道吗？
She's doing a lot better this year. She's on the comeback trail.,她今年的表现有着很大的提高，她的水准也在恢复。
And she's hitting a 257.,她的“击球率”达到了两成五。
Somehow this isn't working.,但是这样还是不能被接受。
But I'm going to ask you a question.,而我现在想问各位一个问题。
"What do you think a batting average  for a cardiac surgeon or a nurse practitioner  or an orthopedic surgeon,  an OBGYN, a paramedic  is supposed to be?",你们认为， 一位心脏外科医生，或一位职业护理师， 一位骨科外科医生 妇产科医生或急救人员的 “击球率” 应该是多少？
"1,000, very good.",十成？非常好。
"Now truth of the matter is,  nobody knows in all of medicine  what a good surgeon  or physician or paramedic  is supposed to bat.",事实上， 医学界中没有人知道 一个好的外科医生， 医师或急救人员 应该有多少的 “击球率”。
"What we do though is we send each one of them, including myself,  out into the world  with the admonition, be perfect.",我们将他们每个人，包括我自己， 送上职业岗位后 便告诫他们以完美来要求自己 --
"Never ever, ever make a mistake,  but you worry about the details, about how that's going to happen.",绝对，绝对不能作出错误的诊断 -- 但我们让他们自己考虑细节，考虑如何达到这样的标准。
And that was the message that I absorbed  when I was in med school.,这就是我在医学院时 得到的信息。
I was an obsessive compulsive student.,我是一个有着强迫症倾向的学生。
"In high school, a classmate once said  that Brian Goldman would study for a blood test.",在中学时，有个同学曾经说 布莱恩.高德曼会为了血液测验复习。
And so I did.,而我的确这么做了。
"And I studied in my little garret  at the nurses' residence at Toronto General Hospital,  not far from here.",我在离这不远处的多伦多总医院里 护士住宅里的一个小阁楼中， 完成了我的学业。
And I memorized everything.,我背下了所有东西。
"I memorized in my anatomy class  the origins and exertions of every muscle,  every branch of every artery that came off the aorta,  differential diagnoses obscure and common.",我背下了解剖课中 提到的每一块肌肉的起端和伸展方式， 每一条从主动脉延伸出来的动脉的分支系统， 以及一切鲜为人知的或者常见的鉴别诊断。
I even knew the differential diagnosis  in how to classify renal tubular acidosis.,我甚至知道如何鉴别诊断 不同的肾小管性酸中毒症。
"And all the while,  I was amassing more and more knowledge.",在这段时间中， 我积累了越来越多的知识。
"And I did well, I graduated with honors,  And I came out of medical school  with the impression  that if I memorized everything and knew everything,  or as much as possible,  as close to everything as possible,  that it would immunize me against making mistakes.",我的表现很好， 并以优等的成绩毕业。 当我从医学院出来时， 我觉得 我只要记下和明白了所有的东西 – 或者稍退一步 – 将近所有的东西， 那我犯医疗错误的几率就会微乎其微。
"for a while,  until I met Mrs. Drucker.",而我在一段时间之内 的确没有犯错。 直到我遇到了 Drucker 女士。
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Toronto  when Mrs. Drucker was brought to the emergency department  of the hospital where I was working.,Drucker 女士被带入多伦多的 一家教学医院的急诊室时， 我正作为一个实习医生在那里工作。
At the time I was assigned to the cardiology service  on a cardiology rotation.,当时我正因心脏科轮调 而被指派在心血管诊所。
"And it was my job,  when the emergency staff called for a cardiology consult,  to see that patient in emerg.",我的工作是， 当紧急救护人员需要有关于心脏的专业会诊时， 在急症室诊断病人，
and to report back to my attending.,并在之后向负责我的主治医生汇报。
"And I saw Mrs. Drucker, and she was breathless.",当我见到Drucker女士的时候，她的气息已经很微弱。
"And when I listened to her, she was making a wheezy sound.",在我与她交谈时，我听到她的呼吸有喘息的声音。
"And when I listened to her chest with a stethoscope,  I could hear crackly sounds on both sides  that told me that she was in congestive heart failure.",当我用听诊器聆听她的胸腔时， 两边都传来的爆裂的声音告诉我， 这是郁血性心脏衰竭。
"This is a condition in which the heart fails,  and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward,  some of the blood backs up into the lung, the lungs fill up with blood,  and that's why you have shortness of breath.",这是由于心脏在衰竭后， 无法将所有的血液完全的输送出去， 而导致部分血液回流入肺脏。肺脏里充满了血液， 而造成呼吸短促。
And that wasn't a difficult diagnosis to make.,这不是一个困难的诊断。
I made it and I set to work treating her.,作出诊断后我开始着手帮她治疗。
I gave her aspirin. I gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart.,我开给了她阿司匹林，并给了她一些可以减轻她心脏负担的药物。
"I gave her medications that we call diuretics, water pills,  to get her to pee out the access fluid.",我还给了她一些利尿剂，俗称水丸， 帮助她将体内多余的水分排出。
"And over the course of the next hour and a half or two,  she started to feel better.",在接下来的一两个小时里， 她开始觉得好转，
And I felt really good.,我也感到高兴。
And that's when I made my first mistake;  I sent her home.,而就在此时我犯了第一个错误： 我让她回了家。
"Actually, I made two more mistakes.",正确的来说，我还犯了两个错误。
I sent her home  without speaking to my attending.,我在和我的主治汇报之前 便让她回了家。
"I didn't pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do,  which was call my attending and run the story by him  so he would have a chance to see her for himself.",我没有做我照着我应该做的， 拿起电话打给我的主治并让他看一下这个案例， 给他一个亲自见见这名病患的机会。
"And he knew her,  he would have been able to furnish additional information about her.",我的主治认识她， 因此可以提供更详细的病历资料。
Maybe I did it for a good reason.,或许我有这么做的理由。
Maybe I didn't want to be a high-maintenance resident.,或许我并不想做一个需要经常地指导的实习医生。
Maybe I wanted to be so successful  and so able to take responsibility  that I would do so  and I would be able to take care of my attending's patients  without even having to contact him.,也许我太想 可以独当一面， 可以不需要 和我的主治沟通 便照顾好他的病患。
The second mistake that I made was worse.,而我犯的第二个错误更加严重。
"In sending her home,  I disregarded a little voice deep down inside  that was trying to tell me,  ""Goldman, not a good idea. Don't do this.""",在让她回家时， 我忽视了我内心一个微小的声音。 这个声音试图告诉我： “高德曼，这样不好，不要这么做。”
"In fact, so lacking in confidence was I  that I actually asked the nurse  who was looking after Mrs. Drucker,  ""Do you think it's okay if she goes home?""",其实，当时的我是如此的没有自信， 以至于我甚至向照顾Drucker女士 的护士寻求了意见： “你觉得让她回家好么？”
"And the nurse thought about it  and said very matter-of-factly, ""Yeah, I think she'll do okay.""",那位护士想了想， 然后就事论事的说：“嗯，我觉得没有问题。”
I can remember that like it was yesterday.,这一切对我来说，都还像是发生在了昨天。
"So I signed the discharge papers,  and an ambulance came, paramedics came to take her home.",我在出院单上签了名， 一辆救护车来后急救人员将她送回了家。
And I went back to my work on the wards.,之后我回到了我在诊所的工作。
"All the rest of that day,  that afternoon,  I had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach.",在接下来的一天中， 那天下午， 我的肠胃有着一种翻滚的感觉。
But I carried on with my work.,但我还是照常的继续工作。
"And at the end of the day, I packed up to leave the hospital  and walked to the parking lot  to take my car and drive home  when I did something that I don't usually do.",在工作结束后，我整理了下便离开了医院。 在我走向停车场 去取我的车的路程中， 我做了一件我平常不会做的事情。
I walked through the emergency department on my way home.,我从急诊室借了道。
"And it was there that another nurse,  not the nurse who was looking after Mrs. Drucker before, but another nurse,  said three words to me  that are the three words  that most emergency physicians I know dread.",而就在那里，另外一位护士， 不是之前照顾Drucker女士的那位， 对我说了 绝大部分急诊医生 都害怕听到的三个字。
"Others in medicine dread them as well,  but there's something particular about emergency medicine  because we see patients so fleetingly.",其他科系的医生也害怕这三个字， 但因为急诊医生看的病人都来去匆匆， 这三个字对我们有着特别的意义。
The three words are:  Do you remember?,这三个字是： 记得吗？
"""Do you remember that patient you sent home?""",“记得吗？你送回家的那个患者？”
the other nurse asked matter-of-factly.,那位护士就事论事的问道。
"""Well she's back,""  in just that tone of voice.",“她又回来了。” 她就用了这样平常的语调。
Well she was back all right.,她的确回来了。
She was back and near death.,回来时已经濒临死亡。
"About an hour after she had arrived home,  after I'd sent her home,  she collapsed and her family called 911  and the paramedics brought her back to the emergency department  where she had a blood pressure of 50,  which is in severe shock.",在我让她回家后 大约一个小时后， 她昏倒在了地上，她的家人打了911， 急救人员将她重新带回了急诊室。 此时的她已严重休克， 血压只有 50。
And she was barely breathing and she was blue.,她的呼吸极其微弱，面色发青。
And the emerg. staff pulled out all the stops.,急救人员们使出了浑身解数。
They gave her medications to raise her blood pressure.,他们给了她提升血压的药物，
They put her on a ventilator.,并将她连接上了人工呼吸器。
And I was shocked  and shaken to the core.,我震惊不已， 吓得不得了。
"And I went through this roller coaster,  because after they stabilized her,  she went to the intensive care unit,  and I hoped against hope that she would recover.",之后我的心情便像是做着云霄飞车一般， 因为当他们将她的情况稳定下来后， 便将她送进了加护病房， 我在绝望中希望她能够醒过来。
"And over the next two or three days,  it was clear that she was never going to wake up.",但在接下来的两三天中， 她再也不会醒来的可能性越来越大。
She had irreversible brain damage.,她的脑部已经受到了无法逆转的损伤。
And the family gathered.,她的家人聚在了一起。
"And over the course of the next eight or nine days,  they resigned themselves to what was happening.",在接下来的八到九天里， 他们慢慢的接受了这件事实。
"And at about the nine day mark, they let her go --  Mrs. Drucker,  a wife, a mother  and a grandmother.",在第九天，他们选择让她离开人间 -- Drucker女士， 一个家庭的妻子，母亲， 和祖母。
They say you never forget the names  of those who die.,有人说你永远不会忘记那些 (因你的疏忽而过世的）人的名字，
And that was my first time to be acquainted with that.,而那是我第一次意识到这句话的现实。
"Over the next few weeks,  I beat myself up  and I experienced for the first time  the unhealthy shame that exists  in our culture of medicine --  where I felt alone, isolated,  not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel,  because you can't talk about it with your colleagues.",在接下来的几个星期内， 我无比的沮丧， 并第一次经历了 那种在医学文化中存在的 危险的羞愧感 -- 我觉得孤单无助。 这不是那种健康的羞愧感， 因为你不能和你的同事提起讨论它。
"You know that healthy kind,  when you betray a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal  and then you get busted  and then your best friend confronts you  and you have terrible discussions,  but at the end of it all that sick feeling guides you  and you say, I'll never make that mistake again.",– 就是那种， 当你背叛了对挚友的承诺而说出了答应要保守的秘密， 并被他知道了以后， 你的挚友找你算账时， 虽然你们会争执不休， 但最后那层罪恶感仍然会主导你， 你告诉自己，我绝对不会再犯同样的错误。
And you make amends and you never make that mistake again.,如是，你做了修正的承诺，然后你永不会再犯那样的错。
That's the kind of shame that is a teacher.,这种羞愧有着教导的作用。
The unhealthy shame I'm talking about  is the one that makes you so sick inside.,而我所说的那种非良性的羞愧 会让你愧对于心。
"It's the one that says,  not that what you did was bad,  but that you are bad.",它会对你说， 并非你做的是错的， 而是你根本就是坏人。
And it was what I was feeling.,这便是我当时的感觉。
And it wasn't because of my attending; he was a doll.,而这也不是因为我的主治；他人非常好。
"He talked to the family, and I'm quite sure that he smoothed things over  and made sure that I didn't get sued.",他和那家人好好的谈过。我确定他为了确保 我没有被控告而替我打了圆场。
And I kept asking myself these questions.,但我仍然不断问我自己这些问题：
Why didn't I ask my attending? Why did I send her home?,为什么当时我没有联系我的主治？为什么我当时会让她回家？
And then at my worst moments:  Why did I make such a stupid mistake?,更加沮丧时，我会问： 我为什么会犯下如此愚蠢的错误？
Why did I go into medicine?,为什么我会选择进入医学界？
"Slowly but surely,  it lifted.",慢慢的但稳定地， 那糟糕的感觉开始淡化了。
I began to feel a bit better.,我开始觉得缓和了些。
"And on a cloudy day,  there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out  and I wondered,  maybe I could feel better again.",然后在一个阴云密布的日子里， 当我看到一束阳光从云隙中探出， 我觉得， 或许我能再次感觉好起来。
"And I made myself a bargain  that if only I redouble my efforts to be perfect  and never make another mistake again,  please make the voices stop.",然后我和自己做了一个约定： 如果我加倍努力做到完美， 不再犯错， 请就此让那自责的声音消去。
And they did.,那个声音的确停止了。
And I went back to work.,我回到了工作岗位。
And then it happened again.,但错误又发生了。
"Two years later I was an attending in the emergency department  at a community hospital just north of Toronto,  and I saw a 25 year-old man with a sore throat.",两年后，当我在一家多伦多北部一间社区医院的 急症室做主治医生时， 我看了一位喉咙酸痛的25岁的男人。
"It was busy, I was in a bit of a hurry.",当时诊所很忙，所以我也有些急。
He kept pointing here.,他不停的指着这里。
"I looked at his throat, it was a little bit pink.",我看了看，他的喉咙有些红肿。
And I gave him a prescription for penicillin  and sent him on his way.,我给他开了盘尼西林的处方后 便让他离开了。
"And even as he was walking out the door,  he was still sort of pointing to his throat.",即便当他走出诊所的大门的时候， 他似乎还在指着他的喉咙。
"And two days later I came to do my next emergency shift,  and that's when my chief asked to speak to me quietly in her office.",两天后，又轮到我在急诊室值班。 那时我的主任要我去她的办公室里私下谈谈。
And she said the three words:  Do you remember?,她说了那三个字： 记得吗？
"""Do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat?""",“记得吗？那位你看过的喉咙酸痛的患者？”
"Well it turns out, he didn't have a strep throat.",原来，他并没有得链球菌性咽喉炎。
He had a potentially life-threatening condition  called epiglottitis.,得的是一种有可能威胁到生命的病症， 叫会厌炎。
"You can Google it,  but it's an infection, not of the throat, but of the upper airway,  and it can actually cause the airway to close.",各位可以在谷歌上查询， 但它不是喉咙，而是上呼吸道的感染， 并有可能造成呼吸道阻塞。
And fortunately he didn't die.,幸好，他并没有过世。
He was placed on intravenous antibiotics  and he recovered after a few days.,在被安排做抗生素静脉注射的几天之后， 他便痊愈了。
"And I went through the same period of shame and recriminations  and felt cleansed and went back to work,  until it happened again and again and again.",而我又回到了那个愧疚和自责的时光中， 然后等情绪平复后，又回到了工作岗位， 直到这些错误再度重复的发生。
"Twice in one emergency shift, I missed appendicitis.",在同一个急诊的值班中，我两次没有发现病患得了盲肠炎。
"Now that takes some doing,  especially when you work in a hospital  that at the time saw but 14 people a night.",这是很难想象会发生的事情， 尤其是当你在一间一个晚上 只见十四名病患的医院工作。
"Now in both cases, I didn't send them home  and I don't think there was any gap in their care.",虽然对这两个病例，我都没有让他们回家， 而我也不觉得在治疗照顾过程中有任何空隙和差错。
One I thought had a kidney stone.,其中一位我诊断他有肾结石，
"I ordered a kidney X-ray. When it turned out to be normal,  my colleague who was doing a reassessment of the patient  noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant and called the surgeons.",并安排了肾脏X光，但结果正常。 我的同事当时正在对病人的病情做重新的诊断。 在他留意到病人右下腹的地方有些柔软时，便联系了外科医生。
The other one had a lot of diarrhea.,另一位病患有严重的腹泻。
I ordered some fluids to rehydrate him  and asked my colleague to reassess him.,我给了他一些液体帮助他补充水分， 并让我的同事重新看了看。
"And he did  and when he noticed some tenderness in the right lower quadrant, called the surgeons.",他照做了。 当他注意到病人右下腹有些柔软时，也联系了外科医生。
"In both cases,  they had their operations and they did okay.",这两名病患 都做了手术并康复了。
"But each time,  they were gnawing at me, eating at me.",但每当我想到这两起病例， 那种感觉都会折磨啃噬我。
"And I'd like to be able to say to you  that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice  as many of my colleagues say, which is total B.S.",而我也希望我可以告诉你 我造成的最严重的错误只发生在了我开始行医的前五年， 像我众多的同事所称一般。但这完全是扯淡。
Some of my doozies have been in the last five years.,在最近的五年中，我也犯了一些错误。
"Alone, ashamed and unsupported.",我依然觉得孤独，羞愧，无助。
"Here's the problem:  If I can't come clean  and talk about my mistakes,  if I can't find the still-small voice  that tells me what really happened,  how can I share it with my colleagues?",但问题的症结是： 如果我不能理清 和谈论我所犯过的错误， 如果我无法找到那可以告诉我错误的源头的 那仍然微小的声音， 我又如何能和我的同事分享我的经验？
How can I teach them about what I did  so that they don't do the same thing?,我又如何教导他们， 让他们不再重蹈我的覆辙？
"If I were to walk into a room --  like right now, I have no idea what you think of me.",当我走入一个场合时 -- 就像现在，我完全不知道各位如何看待我。
When was the last time you heard somebody talk  about failure after failure after failure?,你们上一次听到别人谈论自己 一次又一次的失败是什么时候的事情？
"Oh yeah, you go to a cocktail party  and you might hear about some other doctor,  but you're not going to hear somebody  talking about their own mistakes.",是的，如果你们去参加一场聚会， 你或许会听到某些关于其他医生的错误的闲聊， 但你不会听到有人 谈论自己所犯的错误。
"If I were to walk into a room filled with my colleages  and ask for their support right now  and start to tell what I've just told you right now,  I probably wouldn't get through two of those stories  before they would start to get really uncomfortable,  somebody would crack a joke,  they'd change the subject and we would move on.",如果我现在走入一间坐满我的同事的房间， 向他们寻求帮助 并开始和他们说我刚才告诉各位的事情， 或许在我还没讲超过两个故事之前， 他们就会开始感到非常的不自在。 有人就会讲个笑话， 然后他们会改变话题。
"And in fact, if I knew and my colleagues knew  that one of my orthopedic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital,  believe me, I'd have trouble  making eye contact with that person.",事实上，如果我，或者我的同事， 知道医院中一位骨科的同事帮病人截错了腿， 相信我，当我遇到他时， 我也无法与他有正常眼神的交汇。
That's the system that we have.,这就是我们所拥有的体系 --
It's a complete denial of mistakes.,一个完完全全的否定错误的体系。
"It's a system  in which there are two kinds of physicians --  those who make mistakes  and those who don't,  those who can't handle sleep deprivation and those who can,  those who have lousy outcomes  and those who have great outcomes.",在这个制度当中 只有两种人 -- 犯错的 不犯错的， 可以调适睡眠不足的和不可以忍受的， 以及那些有着糟糕的结果 和有着优秀的结果的。
"And it's almost like an ideological reaction,  like the antibodies begin to attack that person.",这几乎就像免疫系统的自我反应， 像抗体一般开始攻击那个不一样的人。
"And we have this idea  that if we drive the people who make mistakes  out of medicine,  what will we be left with, but a safe system.",我们有着一种想法： 当我们将所有的会犯错的人 赶出医学界后， 我们便会得到一个安全的系统。
But there are two problems with that.,但这种想法会衍生出两个问题。
"In my 20 years or so  of medical broadcasting and journalism,  I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors  to learn everything I can,  from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star  to my show ""White Coat, Black Art.""",在我二十余年的 医疗广播和新闻工作中， 从我为多伦多星报所写的第一篇文章 到我的节目《白袍魔艺》， 我自行研究了我可以接触到的 一切医疗疏失和医疗错误。
And what I've learned  is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.,而我所学到的， 便是错误绝对是无处不在。
"We work in a system  where errors happen every day,  where one in 10 medications  are either the wrong medication given in hospital  or at the wrong dosage,  where hospital-acquired infections are getting more and more numerous,  causing havoc and death.",我们工作在一个 每天都会发生错误的制度中。 医院有十分之一的几率 会给错药 或者给了错误的剂量， 而在医院内被传染的病例正在日渐增多， 造成不必要的伤害和死亡。
"In this country,  as many as 24,000 Canadians die  of preventable medical errors.",在这个国家中， 有将近2万4千多加拿大人死于 可以避免的医疗错误。
"In the United States, the Institute of Medicine pegged it at 100,000.",在美国，据医学学院统计，这个人数达到了10万之多。
"In both cases, these are gross underestimates,  because we really aren't ferreting out the problem  as we should.",即使如此，这两项数据也还是过于低估了现实， 因为我们从未像我们该做的那般 深入地探究这个问题。
And here's the thing.,重点是，
"In a hospital system  where medical knowledge is doubling  every two or three years, we can't keep up with it.",在一个医疗知识 以两到三年为单位成倍增长的 医院体系中，我们无法紧跟着这些知识的增长。
Sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive.,睡眠不足的情形绝对是非常普遍的，
We can't get rid of it.,而我们也无法摆脱这个问题。
"We have our cognitive biases,  so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain.",我们自己的直觉偏差也会直接影响到我们的结论。 比如说，我可以为一位胸痛的病人记录下完美的病历。
"Now take the same patient with chest pain,  make them moist and garrulous  and put a little bit of alcohol on their breath,  and suddenly my history is laced with contempt.",但如果这位同样的胸痛的病人 当时胡言乱语 再加上呼吸带着些许的酒精味的话， 我写下的病历便会挟带着些许的轻蔑。
I don't take the same history.,而这份病历便会截然不同。
I'm not a robot;  I don't do things the same way each time.,我不是机器人， 不会每次都做同样的事情。
And my patients aren't cars;  they don't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time.,我的病患也不是车子， 他们不会每次都用相同的方式去描述他们的症状。
"Given all of that, mistakes are inevitable.",因此错误是无可避免的。
"So if you take the system, as I was taught,  and weed out all the error-prone health professionals,  well there won't be anybody left.",如果真像我被教导的体系那般 赶出所有易出错的医护专业人员， 那么这个领域便不会有人留下。
And you know that business  about people not wanting  to talk about their worst cases?,还有就是关于 人们不愿 谈论他们所犯的最糟糕的错误一事。
"On my show, on ""White Coat, Black Art,""  I made it a habit of saying, ""Here's my worst mistake,""  I would say to everybody  from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery,  ""Here's my worst mistake,"" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  ""What about yours?"" and I would point the microphone towards them.",在我的节目《白袍魔艺》中， 我已经会习惯性地说：“这是我最糟糕的错误”。 我会对从急救医士 到心脏外科首席医师的每个人这么说： “这是我最糟糕的错误，如是，如是。” 然后我会把麦克风递给他们，问：“你呢？”
"And their pupils would dilate,  they would recoil,  then they would look down and swallow hard  and start to tell me their stories.",此时他们的瞳孔会放大， 他们会退却。 然后他们会看着地上，猛吞着口水 并开始向我倾诉他们的故事。
They want to tell their stories. They want to share their stories.,他们想说他们的故事，他们也想分享他们的故事。
"They want to be able to say,  ""Look, don't make the same mistake I did.""",他们想能够说： “听着，别犯和我一样的错。”
What they need is an environment to be able to do that.,他们只是需要一个场合来吐露心声。
What they need is a redefined medical culture.,他们需要的是一个重新定义的医学文化，
And it starts with one physician at a time.,从一位又一位个别的医生开始。
"The redefined physician is human,  knows she's human,  accepts it, isn't proud of making mistakes,  but strives to learn one thing  from what happened  that she can teach to somebody else.",重新定义过的医生也是人类， 明白她自己是人， 并接受这个事实。她并不觉得犯错误是光荣的， 却可以 从其中学习 并教于他人。
She shares her experience with others.,她会与他人分享她的经验，
She's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes.,并在别人谈论自己过错的时候给于支持。
"And she points out other people's mistakes,  not in a gotcha way,  but in a loving, supportive way  so that everybody can benefit.",她不会有一种落井下石的心态， 而会以一种 可以让每个人都从中受惠的关怀，了解的方式 来指出他人的错误。
"And she works in a culture of medicine  that acknowledges  that human beings run the system,  and when human beings run the system, they will make mistakes from time to time.",而她所工作的医学文化 承认 整个体系是由人在运作， 而当人在运作一个体系的时候，时不时地错误在所难免。
"So the system is evolving  to create backups  that make it easier to detect those mistakes  that humans inevitably make  and also fosters in a loving, supportive way  places where everybody who is observing  in the health care system  can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes  and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes,  we're rewarded for coming clean.",这样系统才可以不断地进化改革， 产生可以让人更加容易察觉 这些无法避免的错误的 补救方案。 与此同时，我们可以培养一个热心关怀的工作环境， 鼓励每一位 在观察我们的 医疗系统的人 随时指出一些潜在的错误。 尤其是鼓励像我一样的人，当我们犯错后， 我们可以去正面面对并加以改正。
My name is Brian Goldman.,我是布莱恩.高德曼，
I am a redefined physician.,我是一位重新定义后的医生。
I'm human. I make mistakes.,我是一个人类，我也会犯错。
"I'm sorry about that,  but I strive to learn one thing  that I can pass on to other people.",我为此感到抱歉， 但我会尽力从中学习 并教于他人。
"I still don't know what you think of me,  but I can live with that.",我仍然不知各位如何看待我， 但我想我对此可以接受。
And let me close with three words of my own:  I do remember.,最后让我以我自己的三个字做为结语： 我记得。
Do you know how many choices you make  in a typical day?,你知道在日常生活中你平均 每天做多少选择？
Do you know how many choices you make  in typical week?,你知道你平均每周 做多少选择？
"I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans,  and the average number of choices  that the typical American reports making  is about 70 in a typical day.",我最近在超过2000美国人中 做了一个调查， 结果显示，一个典型的美国人 平均每天 做70个选择。
There was also recently a study done with CEOs  in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.,另外最近还有一个对于CEO们的研究 科学家们在一星期中跟着CEO们
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks  that these CEOs engaged in  and how much time they spent engaging  in making decisions related to these tasks.,然后记录下他们所参与和完成的 各种不同的活动与任务 和他们做的所有与这些任务有关的 决定所用的时间。
And they found that the average CEO  engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.,科学家们由此发现，每一个CEO平均 每周参与完成大概139个任务。
"Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.",当然了，每个任务又都是由许多小的选择构成的。
50 percent of their decisions  were made in nine minutes or less.,这其中50%的决定 都是他们在九分钟甚至更短的时间内做出的。
Only about 12 percent of the decisions  did they make an hour or more of their time.,只有其中百分之十二的决定， 用了他们一小时或更长的时间。
Think about your own choices.,想一想你每天做的选择。
Do you know how many choices  make it into your nine minute category  versus your one hour category? How well do you think you're doing  at managing those choices?,你知道它们中多少 是“九分钟抉择” 又有多少是一小时的选择？ 在管理这些选择上， 你做的如何？
"Today I want to talk  about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,  which is the choice overload problem.",今天我要讲一讲 现在社会中我们所面对的最严重的选择问题： 选择过多。
I want to talk about the problem  and some potential solutions.,我想要讲一讲这些问题 与一些可行的解决办法。
"Now as I talk about this problem,  I'm going to have some questions for you  and I'm going to want to know your answers.",我现在先将这个问题， 我要问你们一些问题 然后我希望得到你们的答案。
"So when I ask you a question,  since I'm blind,  only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.",所以当我问你们一个问题 由于我看不见， 不要举手除非你只是想消耗一下卡路里。
"Otherwise, when I ask you a question,  and if your answer is yes,  I'd like you to clap your hands.",（笑声) 否则，当我问你们一个问题， 如果你的答案是：是， 我希望你们可以鼓掌。
So for my first question for you today:  Are you guys ready to hear about the choice overload problem?,所以，我今天给你们的第一个问题是： 对于选择过多这个问题你们准备好听了么？
Thank you.,（观众鼓掌） 谢谢
"So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,  I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;  at least at that time it was truly upscale.",当我还是斯坦福大学的一名本科学生时， 我经常去一个非常高级的杂货店； 至少在当时看来那家店是十分高级的。
It was a store called Draeger's.,它的名字是Draeger‘s。
"Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.",去那家店，就像是去游乐园一样。
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars  and over 500 different kinds  of fruits and vegetables  and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --  and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.,他们有250种不同的黄芥末和醋 还有超过500中不同种类的 蔬菜和水果 还有超过24中不同的瓶装水 而那是我们还在喝水龙头里的水的年代。
"I used to love going to this store,  but on one occasion I asked myself,  well how come you never buy anything?",我过去十分喜欢去这家店， 但是有一次我问自己， 为什么你从来都不买东西呢？
Here's their olive oil aisle.,这是卖橄榄油的过道。
"They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,  including those that were in a locked case  that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.",他们有75种以上不同的橄榄油， 包括那些被锁在盒子里 从4000年的橄榄树上取来的油。
"So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,  and I asked the manager,  ""Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?""",于是有一天我决定去拜访一下这家店的经理， 我问他， “这个给人们所有选择的模型真的有用么？”
"And he pointed to the busloads of tourists  that would show up everyday,  with cameras ready usually.",然后他向我示意了那些每天都会来的 一车一车的 举着相机的游客。
"We decided to do a little experiment,  and we picked jam for our experiment.",我们决定做一个小实验， 然后选择了果酱作为试验品。
Here's their jam aisle.,这是卖果酱的走廊。
They had 348 different kinds of jam.,他们有148种不同的果酱。
We set up a little tasting booth  right near the entrance of the store.,在店门口的地方 我们摆设了一个小的品尝台。
"We there put out six different flavors of jam  or 24 different flavors of jam,  and we looked at two things:  First, in which case  were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?",我们在那儿摆6种 或24种不同味道的果酱， 然后我们观察了两件事： 第一，人们在哪种情况下 更愿意停下脚步品尝一些果酱？
"More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,  than when there were six,  about 40 percent.",相比较下，大部分，约60%的人，在有24种果酱走廊停了脚步， 而当有6种果酱时 只有40%的人。
The next thing we looked at  is in which case were people more likely  to buy a jar of jam.,我们观察的另一件事是： 在人们在哪种情况下更愿意 买一罐果酱
Now we see the opposite effect.,这时，我们观察到了相反的结果。
"Of the people who stopped when there were 24,  only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.",在那些在有24种果酱时停下的人们中， 只有3%的人真正买了果酱。
"Of the people who stopped when there were six,  well now we saw that 30 percent of them  actually bought a jar of jam.",而此时，在那些在有6种果酱时停下的人们中， 我们发现有30%的人 买了果酱。
"Now if you do the math,  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam  Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam  is probably good for us --  at least it's good for our waistlines --  but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us  even in very consequential decisions. We choose not to choose,  even when it goes against our best self-interests.",现在如果你算一下的话， 当人们只有六种选择时， 比有24种时 买果酱的倾向上升了至少六倍 选择不买果酱 也许对我们来说是一件好事儿 至少对我们的水桶腰来说， 但是结果证明过度选择甚至在 非常重要的决定上影响我们。 我们甚至在有悖个人利益的情况下， 宁愿放弃选择。
So now for the topic of today: financial savings.,所以现在来介绍我们今天的话题：金融理财。
"Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang  where we looked at the retirement savings decisions  of nearly a million Americans  from about 650 plans  all in the U.S.","现在我要向你们介绍我与Gur Huberman, Emir Kamerica, Wei Jang 一起做的一个关于 近百万美国人在全美650多种 养老金计划中 选择的"
"And what we looked at  was whether the number of fund offerings  available in a retirement savings plan,  the 401 plan,  does that affect people's likelihood  to save more for tomorrow.",研究。 我们研究了 养老金计划， 也就是401（k)雇员福利中 所提供的基金选择数量， 是否影响人们 为未来存款的几率。
And what we found  was that indeed there was a correlation.,我们发现， 这之前却是有联系。
"So in these plans, we had about 657 plans  that ranged from offering people  anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.",于是在这些计划中，我们选择了657个 从提供2到59种基金 的不同计划。
"And what we found was that,  the more funds offered,  indeed, there was less participation rate.",我们发现， 事实上，提供的基金越多， 参购率就越低。
"So if you look at the extremes,  those plans that offered you two funds,  participation rates were around in the mid-70s --  still not as high as we want it to be.",所以如果观察一下极端的情况的话， 会发现那些提供给客户两种基金的计划 的参购率在70左右， 仍然没有我们期待中的那么高。
"In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,  participation rates have now dropped  to about the 60th percentile.",那些提供接近60种基金的计划， 参购率降低到了 60多的参购率。
"Now it turns out  that even if you do choose to participate  when there are more choices present,  even then, it has negative consequences.",由此看来， 即使是你真的选择参与一个计划， 当那么多计划摆在你面前时， 还是会造成负面的影响。
"So for those people who did choose to participate,  the more choices available,  the more likely people were  to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.",所以对于那些选择参与计划的人来说， 选择越多， 他们越容易选择 完全避开股票或类似的基金。
"The more choices available,  the more likely they were  to put all their money in pure money market accounts.",选择越多， 越容易造成人们 把钱存进单纯的存钱账户中。
Now neither of these extreme decisions  are the kinds of decisions  that any of us would recommend for people  when you're considering their future financial well-being.,现在，这两种极端选择 没有一种是当考虑到朋友未来的生活时， 我们会推荐给朋友的 好的选择。
"Well, over the past decade,  we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices.",在过去十年中， 我们观察到了提供人们越来越多的选择
They're more likely to delay choosing --  procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.,所造成的负面影响 他们越来越容易推迟选择的过程， 即使这样做会损害到自身的利益。
"They're more likely to make worse choices --  worse financial choices, medical choices.",人们更容易做出更差的选择- 更差的理财选择，医疗选择。
"They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,  even when they do objectively better.",人们更容易选择那些令自己不满意的选项， 即使那些选择也许客观来讲并没有那么差。
"The main reason for this  is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls  of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting  and actually picking from that stunning display.",这是因为， 虽然我们很享受看一排一排 由美乃滋，黄芥末，醋和果酱建成的的高墙， 却不愿意亲自比较 然后在如此庞大的陈列中做出选择。
So what I want to propose to you today  are four simple techniques --  techniques that we have tested in one way or another  in different research venues --  that you can easily apply  in your businesses.,所以今天我想向你们介绍 四种简单的技巧- 它们都是你可以轻松地 运用在生意上， 并且被测试过许多次的 可靠技巧。
The first: Cut.,一：精减。
"You've heard it said before,  but it's never been more true than today,  that less is more.",你们以前也许听过， 但这个说法在从前的社会从未像现今一样的适用- “少即是多”
"People are always upset when I say, ""Cut.""","每一次我说“精减""的时候，人们总是会很生气。"
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.,他们担心这样做会导致他们丢失自我空间。
"But in fact, what we're seeing more and more  is that if you are willing to cut,  get rid of those extraneous redundant options,  well there's an increase in sales,  there's a lowering of costs,  there is an improvement of the choosing experience.",但事实上，根据我们所观察到的是 当一个人越是愿意 放弃多余的选择， 使得营业额上升， 价格降低， 越是会改善原则的经历。
"When Proctor &amp; Gamble  went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15,  they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.",当保洁公司 将26种不同的海飞丝减至15种时， 销售额上升了百分之十。
"When the Golden Cat Corporation  got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,  they saw an increase in profits  by 87 percent --  a function of both increase in sales  and lowering of costs.",当金猫公司 停止了他们的十种销售量最差的猫粮的销售， 盈利上升了 百分之八十七- 是又能增加销售额 还降低了成本两全其美的好方法。
"You know, the average grocery store today  offers you 45,000 products.",正如你们所知道的，现在一个普通的杂货店 提供45000种商品给你选择。
"The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.",一个典型的沃尔玛为你提供100000种商品。
"But the ninth largest retailer,  the ninth biggest retailer in the world today  is Aldi,  and it offers you only 1,400 products --  one kind of canned tomato sauce.",但是，第九大的零售商 今天世界上第九大的零售商， 是阿尔迪， 而他们只提供给顾客1400种商品- 一种罐装番茄酱。
"Now in the financial savings world,  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out  on how to best manage the choice offerings  has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,  which was the program that they have at Harvard.",在这个理财的世界中， 我认为在关于如何最有效地管理选择中 最好的例子是 David Laibson十分投入的 一个哈佛的项目。
Every single Harvard employee  is now automatically enrolled  in a lifecycle fund.,哈佛的每一个教职工 都自动被登记加入 一个生活周期基金中。
"For those people who actually want to choose,  they're given 20 funds,  not 300 or more funds.",那些愿意自己选择的人， 有20种不同的基金选择， 而不是300种甚至更多。
"You know, often, people say,  ""I don't know how to cut.",你知道，人们很喜欢说， ”我不知道怎么消减

"And if your employees can't tell them apart,  neither can your consumers.""",如果你的员工们不能分辨它们的不同， 你的顾客肯定也不能。“
"Now before we started our session this afternoon,  I had a chat with Gary.",今天下午在这个活动开始之前， 我跟Gary聊了一会儿。
And Gary said that he would be willing  to offer people in this audience  an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world.,Gary跟我说他愿意 为今天在场的所有观众提供 一次到这个世界上最美的路的旅行，
Here's a description of the road.,并且完全免费。
And I'd like you to read it.,我希望你们读一下 对这条路的描写。
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it  if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.,现在我给你们几秒钟自己读一下， 如果你愿意接受Gary的提议的话，
Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.,就请鼓掌。  好，有人愿意接受他的提议么？
Is that all?,没有其他人了么？
"All right, let me show you some more about this.",好吧，我多给你们看一些有关此事的。
"You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.",你们早就知道这是个诡计了，是吧？
Now who's ready to go on this trip.,现在，有谁愿意去这次旅行？
I think I might have actually heard more hands.,（观众鼓掌）  我以为我会听到更多掌声呢。
All right.,好吧，
"Now in fact,  you had objectively more information  the first time around than the second time around,  but I would venture to guess  that you felt that it was more real the second time around.",事实上， 客观地来讲， 你们第一次的时候比第二次得到的信息要多， 但是我冒昧地猜 你们觉得第二次更真实一些。
Because the pictures made it feel  more real to you.,因为那些照片让你们 感觉更真实。
"Which brings me to the second technique  for handling the choice overload problem,  which is concretization.",而这个例子就是我们今天要讲的第二个 处理选择过多的技巧， 具体化。
"That in order for people to understand  the differences between the choices,  they have to be able to understand  the consequences associated with each choice,  and that the consequences need to be felt  in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.",为了令人们更好地理解 众多选择之间的区别， 他们必须理解， 每一个选择所将带来的后果， 而这些后果必须是可以 十分清晰、具体地感受到的。
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more  when they use an ATM card or a credit card  as opposed to cash?,为什么人们平均每天花 比用现今多15%到30%的时间 在自动提款机或信用卡上呢？
Because it doesn't feel like real money.,因为那样感觉不像是真正的钱。
And it turns out  that making it feel more concrete  can actually be a very positive tool  to use in getting people to save more.,所以 原来使感觉更具体化 可以成为令人们节约的 好方法。
"So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi  and Alessandro Previtero,  we did a study with people at ING --  employees that are all working at ING --  and now these people were all in a session  where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan.",所以在一个我与Shlomo Benartzi 和Alessandro Precitero做的研究中， 我们和所有ING的 员工一起做了一个研究， 所有人都参加了一个 一起注册401雇员福利的会议。
"And during that session,  we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,  but we added one little thing.",在这个过程中 我们在保持每个会议完全相同的情况下， 加了一个小东西。
"The one little thing we added  was we asked people  to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life  By doing that simple thing,  there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent  and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save  or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account  by four percent.",我们加的是， 让他们 每个人都想象如果多存一些 生命中可能会发生的那些美好的事情。 仅仅是这样做后， 参与率上升了百分之二十， 人们愿意存钱的数额或者说是 愿意放进自己储蓄账户的金额增长了 百分之四。
The third technique: Categorization.,第三个技巧：分类。
We can handle more categories  than we can handle choices.,相比处理选择来说， 我们可以轻松处理更多类别。
"So for example,  here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.",比如说， 我们做了一个有关买杂志类过道的研究，
"It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores  up and down the northeast corridor,  the magazine aisles range anywhere  from 331 different kinds of magazines  all the way up to 664.",发现在Wegmans百货商店中， 在东北走廊的地方， 买杂志的那一栏 有331到 甚至664种杂志。
But you know what?,但是你们知道么？
"If I show you 600 magazines  and I divide them up into 10 categories,  versus I show you 400 magazines  and divide them up into 20 categories,  you believe that I have given you  more choice and a better choosing experience  if I gave you the 400  than if I gave you the 600.",如果我先给你们看600本杂志， 然后把它们分成10类， 然后再给你们看400本杂志， 但是分成20类， 你们会相信， 当我给你们看 400本杂志时 比给你们600本时的选择更多，选择体验更好。
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.,因为类别可以帮我分辨它们的区别。
Here are two different jewelry displays.,这里有两个不同的珠宝展示，
"One is called ""Jazz"" and the other one is called ""Swing.""",一个叫“爵士”，另一个叫“摇摆”
"If you think the display on the left is Swing  and the display on the right is Jazz,  clap your hands.",如果你觉得左边的是“摇摆” 右边的是“爵士” 就请鼓掌。
"Okay, there's some.",好吧，有一些。
"If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  clap your hands.",如果你觉得左边的是“爵士”， 右边的是“摇摆” 请鼓掌。
"Okay, a bit more.",稍微多一点儿了。
Now it turns out you're right.,你们是对的。
"The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  but you know what?",左边的的确是“爵士”，而右边的正是“摇摆”， 但是你知道么？
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.,这是一个十分无用的分类阴谋。
"The categories need to say something  to the chooser, not the choice-maker.",类别必须可以告诉 选择者一些事情，而不是创造选择的人。
And you often see that problem  when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.,你们也许可以在 那些冗长的基金名单中看到这个问题。
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?,到底谁才是应该得到信息的人呢？
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.,我的第四个技巧是：从简入繁
"It turns out we can actually  handle a lot more information than we think we can,  we've just got to take it a little easier.",事实上，我们所能 承受的信息量比我们想象的要高， 我们需要做的就是用轻松地面度对待。
We have to gradually increase the complexity.,我们必须逐渐加大复杂程度。
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.,现在我给你们举一个有关的例子。
"Let's take a very, very complicated decision:  buying a car.",我们来一起做一个非常非常复杂的决定： 买车。
Here's a German car manufacturer  that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.,现在有一个德国制造商， 愿意让你定制一辆完全个性化的车。
"You've got to make 60 different decisions,  completely make up your car.",你必须要做60个不同的决定 才能做好这辆车。
Now these decisions vary  in the number of choices that they offer per decision.,这些决定包括 每一个决定所提供的选择。
"Car colors, exterior car colors --  I've got 56 choices.",光车的颜色，内置的颜色 就有56种选择。
"Engines, gearshift -- four choices.",有四种发动机，变速排档选择。
So now what I'm going to do  is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.,现在我要做的是 改变这些要做的决定出线的顺序。
"So half of the customers  are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,  to low choice, four gearshifts.",所以，一般的观众 要从选择多的决定开始-56种颜色 开始到选择少的决定-四种变速排档。
"The other half of the customers  are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,  to 56 car colors, high choice.",另外一半的观众 要从选择少的决定，四种变档开始 到56种车颜色，选择多的决定
What am I going to look at?,我想要观察什么呢？
How engaged you are.,你们有多积极。
"If you keep hitting the default button per decision,  that means you're getting overwhelmed,  that means I'm losing you.",如果你不停地按默认选项的话 就说明你已经被选择淹没了， 也就是说我正在失去你的参与。
"What you find  is the people who go from high choice to low choice,  they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.",你会发现， 从选择多的开始到选择少的人 会不停地选择默认选项。
We're losing them.,我们就会逐渐失去他们了
"They go from low choice to high choice,  they're hanging in there.",那些从选择少开始到选择多的人， 还在坚持着。
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.,可是他们所得到的信息是完全一样的。所要做的选择也是一样的。
The only thing that I have done  is I have varied the order  in which that information is presented.,我所做的唯一一件事就是 改变了 信息所出现的顺序。
"If I start you off easy,  I learn how to choose.",如果我给你一个轻松的开始， 教你如何选择。
"Even though choosing gearshift  doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,  it still prepares me for how to choose.",即使选择变速排档 不能说明我对车内颜色的偏好 却仍能教会我如何去选择。
"It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,  so I'm more willing to be motivated  to be engaged.",另一件令我兴奋的事实是我所要组成的是如此一个庞然大物， 所以我变得更有动力 去参与。
So let me recap.,让我重新整理一下重点，
"I have talked about four techniques  for mitigating the problem of choice overload --  cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;  concretize -- make it real;  categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;  condition for complexity.",我讲了四种可以减缓过多选择的 技巧- 精简-放弃没有用的选择； 具体化-让选择变得更真实一些； 分类-我们能承受的类别比选择多； 从简入繁。
"All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today  are designed to help you manage your choices --  better for you, you can use them on yourself,  better for the people that you are serving.",今天我所讲的所有技巧， 都是为了帮助你更好地管理选择而设计的- 使用这些技巧对你更好， 也对你所服务的那些人更好。
Because I believe that the key  to getting the most from choice  is to be choosy about choosing.,所以我相信 从选择中获益最多的关键是 对选择挑剔一些。
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing  the better we will be able  to practice the art of choosing.,我们对选择越是挑剔 就越能 掌握选择的艺术。
Thank you very much.,非常感谢。
"In the 1980s  in the communist Eastern Germany,  if you owned a typewriter,  you had to register it with the government.",20世纪80年代 在共产主义的东德， 如果你有一台打字机， 你就得去跟政府登记。
You had to register  a sample sheet of text  out of the typewriter.,你必须登记 出自那台打字机的 一份文本的样本。
And this was done  so the government could track where text was coming from.,这样做后， 政府就能跟踪文本出自何方。
"If they found a paper  which had the wrong kind of thought,  they could track down  who created that thought.",如果他们发现一张纸上 写着错误的观点， 他们就能跟踪 是谁产生这样的观点。
"And we in the West  couldn't understand how anybody could do this,  how much this would restrict freedom of speech.",而在西方 我们不能理解有人怎么能做这种事， 这将会多么限制言论自由啊。
We would never do that  in our own countries.,我们永远不会在我们自己的国家 里这样做。
"But today in 2011,  if you go and buy a color laser printer  from any major laser printer manufacturer  and print a page,  that page will end up  having slight yellow dots  printed on every single page  in a pattern which makes the page unique  to you and to your printer.",可是，2011年的今天， 如果你从任何一家大型的激光打印机厂商 买一台彩色激光打印机 打印出一页， 这页纸最后 会有一些小黄点 印在每一页上 图案让这页纸是独特 对你和你的打印机都是。

"If we take a look at what's really happening in the online world,  we can group the attacks based on the attackers.",三大来源之一。 如果我们看一下在线世界到底发生了什么， 我们根据攻击者来分组。
We have three main groups.,我们有三个主要的组。
We have online criminals.,我们有在线罪犯。

"The U.S. Secret Service,  two months ago,  froze the Swiss bank account  of Mr. Sam Jain right here,  and that bank account had 14.9 million U.S. dollars on it  Mr. Jain himself is on the loose;  nobody knows where he is.",美国情报局， 两个月前， 冻结了萨姆 杰恩先生 在瑞士的银行账户， 那个账户冻结的时候 帐上有一千四百九十万美金。 杰恩先生本人仍逍遥法外； 没人知道他在哪。
And I claim it's already today  that it's more likely for any of us  to become the victim of a crime online  than here in the real world.,今天我断言 我们当中的任何一位都有可能 成为在线犯罪的受害者 甚至超越现实世界。
And it's very obvious  that this is only going to get worse.,而且很显然 这种情况越来越糟。
"In the future, the majority of crime  will be happening online.",将来，大多数的犯罪 会发生在线上。
The second major group of attackers  that we are watching today  are not motivated by money.,第二类主要的攻击集团 我们今天观察的 不是出于金钱。
"They're motivated by something else --  motivated by protests,  motivated by an opinion,  motivated by the laughs.",他们的动机源于别处 -- 出于抗议， 出于发表意见， 出于被嘲笑过。
Groups like Anonymous  have risen up over the last 12 months  and have become a major player  in the field of online attacks.,这些匿名集团 在过去的12个月中很活跃 并且变成了在线攻击领域的 主要的参与者
"So those are the three main attackers:  criminals who do it for the money,  hacktivists like Anonymous  doing it for the protest,  but then the last group are nation states,  governments doing the attacks.",这些就是三组主要的攻击者： 为了钱的罪犯， 匿名的攻击活跃者 为了抗议而作的， 而最后一组是民族国家， 政府在攻击。
And then we look at cases  like what happened in DigiNotar.,我们看一下例子 就像DigiNotar公司发生的。
This is a prime example of what happens  when governments attack  against their own citizens.,这是政府攻击的 典型例子 来反对自己的民众。
"DigiNotar is a Certificate Authority  from The Netherlands --  or actually, it was.",DigiNotar是荷兰的 一个权威证书 或者说它曾经是。
It was running into bankruptcy  last fall  because they were hacked into.,它去年秋天遭遇 破产 因为他们遭到入侵。

So how do people die  as the result of a hack like this?,那么，究竟如何人们的死亡 归咎于这样一个攻击呢？
Well DigiNotar is a C.A.,DigiNotar是一个权威证书。
They sell certificates.,他们卖证书。
What do you do with certificates?,你用证书做什么？
"Well you need a certificate  if you have a website that has https,  SSL encrypted services,  services like Gmail.",你需要证书的情况会是 你有一个有https的网站， SSL加密服务， 类似Gmail的服务。
"Now we all, or a big part of us,  use Gmail or one of their competitors,  but these services are especially popular  in totalitarian states  like Iran,  where dissidents  use foreign services like Gmail  because they know they are more trustworthy than the local services  and they are encrypted over SSL connections,  so the local government can't snoop  on their discussions.",当今我们所有人或大部分人， 使用Gmail或它对手们中的任何一家， 这些服务在极权主义国家 尤其流行 比如伊朗， 持异议者 使用诸如Gmail的国外服务 因为他们知道这些比当地的服务更可靠 他们通过SSL的连接加密， 所以当地政府窥探不到 他们的讨论。
Except they can if they hack into a foreign C.A.,他们也能，如果他们攻击了一个国外权威证书，
and issue rogue certificates.,出具伪劣证书。

"They had sold this tool  for 280,000 Euros to the Egyptian government.",他们把这套工具 以28万欧元卖给埃及政府。
The company headquarters are right here.,公司的总部就在那里。
So Western governments  are providing totalitarian governments with tools  to do this against their own citizens.,所以，西方政府 给极权政府提供工具 来反对他们自己的民众。
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well.,但西方政府也同样对他们自己这样做。
"For example, in Germany,  just a couple of weeks ago  the so-called State Trojan was found,  which was a trojan  used by German government officials  to investigate their own citizens.",比如，在德国， 就是几周前 发现一个叫Scuinst Trojan 的 木马病毒 被德国政府官方用来 调查他们自己的民众。

"Now when we think deeper  about things like these,  the obvious response from people should be  that, ""Okay, that sounds bad,  but that doesn't really affect me because I'm a legal citizen.",当我们更深的想一下 这些事情， 人们的反应显然应是 “对啊，听起来很糟糕， 但因为我是合法公民，也不会真正影响我啦。

And while we might trust our governments  any right we give away will be given away for good.,我们2011年的当下 会信任我们的政府， 我们放弃的任何权力会永远失去。

"This is where I live. I live in Kenya,  at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park.",这是我所生活的地方，肯尼亚， 在内罗毕国家公园的南部
"Those are my dad's cows at the back,  and behind the cows,  that's the Nairobi National Park.",在我的身后是我父亲的奶牛 在奶牛的后边 就是内罗毕国家公园
"Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely,  which means wild animals like zebras  migrate out of the park freely.",内罗毕国家公园的南部并没有全部围起栅栏 这就意味着像斑马这样的野生动物 可以自由地在公园外移动
"So predators like lions follow them,  and this is what they do.",所以像狮子这样的捕食者会跟随他们 这就是他们的所作所为，
They kill our livestock.,他们捕杀了我们的家畜。
"This is one of the cows which was killed at night,  and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead,  and I felt so bad,  because it was the only bull we had.",这就是其中一只在夜晚被杀害的奶牛 我在早晨醒来时就发现它已经死了， 我的心情槽透了， 因为这是我家里唯一的公牛

And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few.,我想这就是内罗毕公园的狮子会那么少的原因。

"And the first idea I got was to use fire,  because I thought lions were scared of fire.",我想到的第一个办法是使用火， 因为我知道狮子们都惧怕火。
"But I came to realize that that didn't really help,  because it was even helping the lions  to see through the cowshed.",但我又意识到这并没有什么成效， 反倒还帮助了狮子 看到了我们的牛棚。
So I didn't give up. I continued.,但我并没有因此放弃，我坚持不懈着
And a second idea I got was  to use a scarecrow.,于是有了第二个办法： 利用稻草人。
I was trying to trick the lions  [into thinking] that I was standing near the cowshed.,我想要欺骗狮子 让它们误以为是我站在牛舍旁边。
"But lions are very clever.   They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow, and they go back,  but the second day, they'll come and they say,  this thing is not moving here, it's always here.   So he jumps in and kills the animals.",但是狮子十分聪明。 他们第一天来时看到了稻草人，然后就回去了。 但是第二天，他们会再来并且说： 这个东西从没动过，他一直呆在这儿 所以他们又跳进来，杀死了动物。
"So one night, I was walking around the cowshed with a torch,  and that day, the lions didn't come.",有一天晚上，我拿着手电筒在牛棚边走动， 那天晚上，狮子并没有来。

"Since I was a small boy,  I used to work in my room for the whole day,  and I even took apart my mom's new radio,  and that day she almost killed me,  but I learned a lot about electronics.   So I got an old car battery,  an indicator box. It's a small device found in a motorcycle,  and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left. It blinks.",因为我当时是个小孩子， 我可以一整天不干别的，在自己的房间里鼓捣一天， 我甚至把我妈妈新买的收音机拆得七零八落， 那天她差点杀了我， 尽管如此，我学到了许多关于电子的知识。 所以我找到了一个旧的车用蓄电池， 一个指示器。这是一个从摩托车中找到的小装备， 用来控制摩托车的转向灯，能够让灯闪烁。
"And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights, on and off.",同时我找到了一个开关，可以控制灯的亮灭。
And that's a small torch from a broken flashlight.,灯泡来自于一个坏掉的手电筒。
So I set up everything.,一切都准备好了。
"As you can see, the solar panel charges the battery,  and the battery supplies the power  to the small indicator box. I call it a transformer.",就如你所见，由太阳能接收板来给电池充电， 再由电池来指示器给提供能量 我把这个叫做“变压器”，
And the indicator box makes the lights flash.,这个指示器又会使光线闪动，
"As you can see, the bulbs face outside,  because that's where the lions come from.",你可以看到，这个电灯泡是朝外的， 因为狮子是从那儿过来的。
And that's how it looks to lions when they come at night.,当狮子晚上走近的时候看到的就是这个样子。
"The lights flash and trick  the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed,  but I was sleeping in my bed.",这个灯光一闪动就会使狮子受到欺骗 它们会以为是我在牛棚附近走动， 但实际上，此时的我正在自己的床上做着春秋大梦。
Thanks.,谢谢。
"So I set it up in my home two years ago,  and since then, we have never experienced any problem with lions.",我在两年前把这个装置装在了我家中， 从那时起，我们就再没有狮子捕食家禽的烦恼了。

"Since now, I've set up seven homes around my community,  and they're really working.",至今为止，我已为我们家族社区中的七户家庭装上了这个赶狮灯， 它们非常有用。

Peace. Thank you.,讲完了，谢谢！
Thank you.,谢谢。
You probably all agree with me  that this is a very nice road.,(锤声）  （微波炉声） 你们也许会同意 这条路很不错。
"It's made of asphalt,  and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on,  but not always, especially not on these days as today,  when it's raining a lot.",它是沥青做的， 沥青是一种很好的材料，在上面开车很好 但也不总是，特别是像今天这样的天气， 下大雨的时候。
Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt.,在沥青路上会溅起很多水。
"And especially if you then ride with your bicycle,  and pass these cars, then that's not very nice.",尤其是如果你正骑着自行车， 与那些车擦肩而过，就不太好啦。
"Also, asphalt can create a lot of noise.",同时，沥青路会产生很大噪音。
"It's a noisy material,  and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands,  very close to cities, then we would like a silent road.",这种材料有点吵， 如果我们要修的路紧邻城市， 像荷兰的道路那样，我们就会希望噪音小一些。
The solution for that is to make roads  out of porous asphalt.,解决的办法就是 使用多孔沥青来修路。
"Porous asphalt, a material that we use now  in most of the highways in the Netherlands,  it has pores and water can just rain through it,  so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides,  and you have a road that's easy to drive on,  so no splash water anymore.",多孔沥青这种材料 用在荷兰的多数高速公路上， 它有些小毛孔让水渗过去， 雨水会流向旁边， 路上驾车就容易了， 也没有溅起的水花。
Also the noise will disappear in these pores.,噪音也会消失在这些毛孔里。
"Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear,  so it's a very silent road.",因为它有很多空洞，相互抵消了噪音， 所以路就很安静。
"It also has disadvantages, of course,  and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur.",当然，它也有缺点， 这种路的缺点是沥青可能会松脱。
What is raveling? You see that in this road  that the stones at the surface come off.,什么叫松脱？看看这条路 路面上的石头脱落。
"First you get one stone, then several more,  and more and more and more and more,  and then they -- well, I will not do that.   But they can damage your windshield,  so you're not happy with that.",开始一块，接着几块， 越来越多， 后来就——我就不演示了。 但它们会损坏你的挡风玻璃， 你肯定不高兴。
"And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage.",最后，这种松脱会带来越来越多的损害。
Sometimes you can create potholes with that.,有时候路面会出现坑槽
Ha. He's ready.,哈，他早有准备。
"Potholes, of course, that can become a problem,  but we have a solution.",坑坑洼洼当然会变成问题， 但我们有解决的办法。
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material.,这里你看到的是这种材料上出现的损害。
"It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only  a small amount of binder between the stones.",这是沥青，就像我说的， 石头中间有少量的粘合剂。
"Due to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation,  this binder, this bitumen,  the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink,  and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks,  and it delaminates from the aggregates.",由于风化、紫外线、氧化等原因 这种粘合剂，这种沥青， 集料之间的黏胶会收缩， 如果它收缩，就会有小裂纹， 从集块开始会出现分层。
"Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates --  what we just saw here.",如果你在这种路上行驶，你会带出这些集料-- 就是我们看到的。
"To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials.",为了解决这个问题，我们考虑到了自我修复材料。
"If we can make this material self-healing,  then probably we have a solution.",如果我们能让这种材料自我修复， 就有可能有解决方案。
"So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans,  and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces,  and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen.",我们用的就是清洁厨具用的钢丝绒， 钢丝绒可以裁成很小块， 我们把这些小块混进沥青。
So then you have asphalt  with very small pieces of steel wool in it.,所以现在的沥青 有一些小钢丝绒在里面。
"Then you need a machine, like you see here,  that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine.",你再需要一个像这样的机器， 一个感应电机——它可以用来做饭。
"Induction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that.",感应电机可以加热东西，尤其擅长加热钢铁
"Then what you do is you heat up the steel,  you melt the bitumen,  and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks,  and the stones are again fixed to the surface.",所以我们要做的就是把钢铁加热， 把沥青溶化， 沥青就会流进那些小裂缝里， 脱落的小石子就又被粘上了。
Today I use a microwave because I cannot take  the big induction machine here onstage.,由于感应电机太大了拿不上来， 我在这里就用微波炉演示了。
So a microwave is a similar system.,微波炉跟感应电机的原理类似。
"So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out  to see what happened.",我把样品放进去了，现在把它拿出来 看看发生了什么事。
So this is the specimen coming out now.,这是样品现在的样子。
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab  to heat up the specimens.,我们实验室里有工业用的机器 来加热样品。
"We tested a lot of specimens there,  and then the government, they actually saw our results,  and they thought, ""Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that.""",我们测试过很多样品， 政府也看过我们的结果， 他们决定，“这很有趣，我们应该试一下。”
"So they donated to us a piece of highway,  400 meters of the A58, where we had to make  a test track to test this material.",政府免费授权了一段高速公路给我们， 在A58号上400米的距离， 我们就在那里做了材料测试。
"So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road,  and then of course this road will last several years  without any damage. That's what we know from practice.",这就是我们做的。你看到的就是做的实验路段， 当然这段路近几年不会坏。 我们在实践中确认了这点。
So we took a lot of samples from this road  and we tested them in the lab.,我们在这段路上取了很多样品 在实验室里进行各种测试。
"So we did aging on the samples,  did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine,  and healed them and tested them again.",我们做了老化实验， 加了很多负载，用我们的感应电机给它们加热， 重复加热和测试。
Several times we can repeat that.,我们可以多次重复。
"So actually, the conclusion from this research is that  if we go on the road every four years  with our healing machine -- this is the big version  we have made to go on the real road --  if we go on the road every four years  we can double the surface life of this road,  which of course saves a lot of money.",事实上，这项实验得到的结论是 如果我们每四年在这段路上 用我们的加热机器——超大号微波炉 我们要把这个机器搬到公路上用—— 我们每四年上这段路 路面的寿命会加倍， 当然会省很多钱。
"Well, to conclude, I can say  that we made a material  using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers,  using induction energy to really  increase the surface life of the road,  double the surface life you can even do,  so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.",所以，结论是 我们制造了一种材料 使用钢纤维，加了钢纤维 使用感应能量 有效的增加了路面的寿命， 能使路面的寿命加倍， 用这种简单的技巧就会省很多钱。
And now you're of course curious if it also worked.,你会好奇是否会有效。
So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm.,我们看这个样品。现在还有点烫。
"Actually, it still has to cool down first  before I can show you that the healing works.",事实上，我要先让它冷却下来 才能向你们展示加热修复是否有效。
But I will do a trial.,但是要尝试一下。
"Let's see. Yeah, it worked.",看，真的，修好了。
Thank you.,谢谢！

"According to a Quranic verse  ""Salam"" -- peace -- ""is the word of the all-merciful God, raheem.""",《可兰经》的一段经文里说， “Salam”——也就是和平——“来自我们最仁慈的主Raheem。”
"In turn, the word ""raheem,"" which is known in all Abrahamic traditions,  has the same root in Arabic as the word ""rahem"" -- womb --  symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity  from which the male and the female,  from which all tribes, all peoples, have emanated from.",而在所有亚伯拉罕诸教的传统中都闻名的词“raheem” 在阿拉伯语中与“rahem”同根， “rahem”则象征着充满母性的女性包容着所有人类， 男人和女人 以及所有部落、所有民族的人都是从她发源而来的。
"And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo, which grows within it,  the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence.",就像子宫完全包裹着在其内生长的胚胎一样， 满怀同情之心的神圣母体滋养着世间万物。
"Thus we are told that ""My mercy encompasses all things.""",因此，我们所受的教导告诉我们：“我的怜悯之心包容万物。”
"Thus we are told that ""My mercy takes precedence over my anger.""",因此，我们所受的教导告诉我们：“我的怜悯之心战胜我的愤怒。”
May we all be granted a grace of mercy.,愿我们都被赐予怜悯之心。
Thank you.,谢谢你们。

"And my second message is that everyone thinks  domestic violence happens to women,  that it's a women's issue.",我要说的第二个事实，是很多人认为 既然家庭暴力发生在女性身上， 那应该是女性自身的问题。
Not exactly.,不是的。
"Over 85 percent of abusers are men, and domestic abuse  happens only in intimate, interdependent, long-term relationships,  in other words, in families,  the last place we would want or expect to find violence,  which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing.",超过85%的施虐者是男性，并且家庭暴力 只发生在亲密的、相互依存的、长期的关系中， 换句话说，发生在家庭中， 这是我们最不愿意，或最不期望看到暴力的地方。 这也是为什么家庭暴力如此叫人困扰的原因之一。
"I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth  who would stay with a man who beats me,  but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age.",我原本以为世界上只有我一个人 会继续留在一个打我的男人身边， 但是事实上在我这个年龄段这种事情非常普遍。
"I was 22, and in the United States,  women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely  to be domestic violence victims  as women of other ages,  and over 500 women and girls this age  are killed every year by abusive partners,  boyfriends, and husbands in the United States.",我当时22岁。而在美国， 16至24岁的女性相比其他年龄段的女性 受到家庭暴力伤害的可能性 要高出两倍以上。 同样在美国，每年有超过500位 妇女或女孩被施虐者杀害， 凶手是她们的男友，或者丈夫。

"I met Conor on a cold, rainy January night.",我在一个雨夜遇见了康纳，那时是一月份，天很冷。
"He sat next to me on the New York City subway,  and he started chatting me up.",我们在纽约的地铁上碰巧坐在一起， 他先跟我聊了起来。
He told me two things.,他告诉我两件事。
"One was that he, too, had just graduated from an Ivy League school,  and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank.",第一件是他也毕业于常春藤联盟学校， 并且在一个非常好的华尔街银行工作。

"One of the smartest things Conor did, from the very beginning,  was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship.",在初次交往中康纳做的最聪明的事情， 是让我相信，在这段感情中我是强势的一方。
He did this especially at the beginning  by idolizing me.,尤其刚开始的时候，他让我觉得 我是他崇拜的偶像。
"We started dating, and he loved everything about me,  that I was smart, that I'd gone to Harvard,  that I was passionate about helping teenage girls, and my job.",我们开始交往，他喜欢关于我的一切， 例如我的聪明，我在哈佛的求学经历， 我给予青少年女性的热情帮助，以及我的工作。
He wanted to know everything about my family  and my childhood and my hopes and dreams.,他很愿意了解我的家庭、 我的童年、我的愿望和梦想。
"Conor believed in me, as a writer and a woman,  in a way that no one else ever had.",康纳对我信任的程度，我身为一个女人和撰稿人， 之前从未没有在别人那里得到过。
"And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us  by confessing his secret,  which was that, as a very young boy starting at age four,  he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused  by his stepfather,  and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade,  even though he was very smart,  and he'd spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life.",通过透露他不为人知的秘密，他在我们之间营造了 奇特的相互信任的氛围。 他告诉我，他从四岁开始 他的继父就开始持续野蛮的 在身体上虐待他。 虐待的结果是如此之坏，使得他不得不在八年级的时候辍学， 尽管当时他十分的聪明。 他花了几乎20年的时间重建他的生活。
Which is why that Ivy League degree  and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future  meant so much to him.,这也就是为什么常春藤大学的学位， 华尔街的工作和光明的未来， 对他意义重大。
"If you had told me  that this smart, funny, sensitive man who adored me  would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup,  how short my skirts were,  where I lived, what jobs I took,  who my friends were and where I spent Christmas,  I would have laughed at you,  because there was not a hint of violence or control  or anger in Conor at the beginning.",如果那时有人对我说 这个聪明、幽默、体贴并喜欢我的男人 会有一天命令我是否化妆， 我的裙子能多短， 我生活在哪，要做什么工作， 能和谁交朋友和在哪度过圣诞， 我会嘲笑你， 因为我在康纳身上看不出一点暴力或者控制欲 或者愤怒的预兆。
I didn't know that the first stage  in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim.,当时我并不知道， 引诱和迷惑受害者是家庭暴力关系
I also didn't know that the second step is to isolate the victim.,开始的第一步 我当时也不知道，第二步是孤立受害者。
"Now, Conor did not come home one day and announce,  ""You know, hey, all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great,  but I need to move into the next phase  where I isolate you and I abuse you"" —  —  ""so I need to get you out of this apartment  where the neighbors can hear you scream  and out of this city where you have friends and family  and coworkers who can see the bruises.""",康纳并不是回到家，向我宣布 “嘿，虽然罗曼蒂克之类的很棒， 但是我们要进入下一阶段了 我要孤立你然后虐待你。” “所以我要你离开你自己的公寓， 防止你的邻居他听见你的惨叫， 我还要让你离开这个有你的朋友、家人和同事的城市 不然他们会看到你的伤痕。”
"Instead, Conor came home one Friday evening  and he told me that he had quit his job that day,  his dream job,  and he said that he had quit his job because of me,  because I had made him feel so safe and loved  that he didn't need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore,  and he just wanted to get out of the city  and away from his abusive, dysfunctional family,",事实是，康纳在一个周五的晚上回到家， 告诉我他辞掉了他的工作， 他梦寐以求的工作， 他说他是因为我才辞职， 我让他拥有了无比的幸福和安全感， 他再不需要到华尔街证明自己。 现在他只想离开这座城市， 原理那个充满虐待的、不正常的家庭，
and move to a tiny town in New England  where he could start his life over with me by his side.,搬到新英格兰的某个小镇 和我一起在那里开始新的生活。

"I had no idea I was falling into crazy love,  that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid  physical, financial and psychological trap.",我以为自己陷入了疯狂的爱情，还不知道 我已经懵懂的走进了一张精心编织的 控制你身体、心灵和经济的陷阱。
The next step in the domestic violence pattern  is to introduce the threat of violence  and see how she reacts.,家庭暴力模式的第三阶段 就是开始用暴力威胁 并观察她的反应。
And here's where those guns come in.,这就是刚才枪的用途。
"As soon as we moved to New England -- you know,  that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe --  he bought three guns.",我们刚搬到新英格兰小镇 ——我想，康纳应该是觉得这里很安全—— 他就买了三支枪。
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car.,一支放在车子的置物箱里，
"He kept one under the pillows on our bed,  and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times.",一支放在床的枕头下面， 第三支则一直放在口袋里。
And he said that he needed those guns  because of the trauma he'd experienced as a young boy.,他说小时候的精神创伤 使得他需要拥有这些枪
He needed them to feel protected.,来让他自己保持安全感。
"But those guns were really a message for me,  and even though he hadn't raised a hand to me,  my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day.",那些枪对我来说是一个明显的信号， 尽管他并没有拿起枪指着我， 我已经无时不刻不处在危险的边缘。
Conor first physically attacked me  five days before our wedding.,康纳第一次打我 是在我们婚礼的五天前。
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown.,那是早上七点，我还穿着睡袍。
"I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment,  and I got frustrated,  and Conor used my anger as an excuse  to put both of his hands around my neck  and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream,  and he used the chokehold  to hit my head repeatedly against the wall.",我正在用电脑工作，想要完成自由职业撰稿的任务， 当时我有些烦躁， 康纳以我的愤怒为借口， 用双手掐住我的脖子， 死死的掐着，让我无法呼吸，喊不出声。 他从背后勒着我的脖子 一次一次的把我的头往墙上撞。
"Five days later, the ten bruises on my neck had just faded,  and I put on my mother's wedding dress,  and I married him.",五天之后，脖子上的十个手指印刚消退， 我就穿上我妈妈的婚纱， 嫁给了他。
"Despite what had happened,  I was sure we were going to live happily ever after,  because I loved him, and he loved me so much.",尽管发生了那些事情， 我还是相信我们以后能幸福的生活， 因为我们如此的相爱，也因为
"And he was very, very sorry.",他表现出的深深的悔意。

Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week  for the next two and a half years of our marriage.,在我跟康纳两年半的婚姻生活中， 我每周都会被打一到两次。
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique  and alone in this situation.,我曾经误以为只有我一个人 有这样的遭遇。
"One in three American women  experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life,  and the CDC reports that 15 million children  are abused every year, 15 million.",事实上，每三个美国女性中 就有一个曾是家庭暴力受害者或潜在的目标， 而CDC的报告称每年有1500万的儿童 遭受虐待，1500万。
"So actually, I was in very good company.",所以事实上，我不是个例。
Back to my question:  Why did I stay?,回到我的问题： 为什么我要留下来了？
The answer is easy.,答案很简单。
I didn't know he was abusing me.,我并不知道他是在虐待我。
"Even though he held those loaded guns to my head,  pushed me down stairs,  threatened to kill our dog,  pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway,  poured coffee grinds on my head  as I dressed for a job interview,  I never once thought of myself as a battered wife.",尽管他用上膛的枪指着我的头， 把我推下楼梯， 威胁杀掉我们的狗， 在高速公路上拔掉车钥匙， 在我为了面试而准备着装时 把咖啡粉从我头上倒下来， 我从来没有想过自己是一个受到虐待的妻子。
"Instead, I was a very strong woman  in love with a deeply troubled man,  and I was the only person on Earth  who could help Conor face his demons.",正好相反，我是一个很强硬的女性 深爱着这个饱受困扰的男人， 而且我是这世上唯一一个 可以帮助康纳面对自己心魔的人。
"The other question everybody asks is,  why doesn't she just leave?",大家都想问的另一个问题是， 为什么她不离开？
Why didn't I walk out? I could have left any time.,我为什么没有逃跑？我有很多的机会。
"To me, this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask,  because we victims know something you usually don't:  It's incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser.",对我来说，这是人们问过的最让我伤心和痛苦的问题， 你不能理解，但是只有我们受害者自己清楚 离开施虐者是多么的危险。
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern  is kill her.,因为在家庭暴力中的最后一步 就是杀掉她。
"Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders  happen after the victim has ended the relationship,  after she's gotten out,  because then the abuser has nothing left to lose.",超过70%的家庭暴力谋杀 发生在受害者结束这段关系后， 在她离开之后， 因为施虐者已经毫无顾忌。
"Other outcomes include long-term stalking,  even after the abuser remarries;  denial of financial resources;  and manipulation of the family court system  to terrify the victim and her children,  who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time  with the man who beat their mother.",其他可能的结果包括长期的跟踪， 甚至施虐者再婚之后（仍会跟踪）； 拒绝经济支持； 欺骗家庭法庭 来恐吓受害者和她的孩子。 孩子们通常会被家庭问题法官要求 和那个打他们母亲的男人 一起度过一段无人监管的时间。
"And still we ask, why doesn't she just leave?",现在我们仍然会问，她为什么不逃走？
"I was able to leave,  because of one final, sadistic beating  that broke through my denial.",我之所以决定离开， 是因为最后一次残暴的殴打 突破了我能承受的极限。
I realized that the man who I loved so much  was going to kill me if I let him.,我意识到如果我不反抗，这个我曾 深爱的男人会杀掉我。
So I broke the silence.,所以我打破了沉默。
"I told everyone:  the police, my neighbors,  my friends and family, total strangers,  and I'm here today because you all helped me.",我向所有人求助： 警察，邻居， 我的朋友和家人，完全陌生的人， 今天我能站在这里，因为你们每个人都帮助了我。
"We tend to stereotype victims  as grisly headlines, self-destructive women, damaged goods.",我们倾向于将受害者描述成 就像新闻中可怕的标题所言。
"The question, ""Why does she stay?""",“为什么她要留下？” 问这个问题
"is code for some people for, ""It's her fault for staying,""  as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men  intent upon destroying us.",的一些人实际上在说，“这是她自己的错“， 就好像受害者是有意的和意图 摧残她们的男人相爱。
"But since publishing ""Crazy Love,""  I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women  who also got out,  who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened,  and who rebuilt lives -- joyous, happy lives --  as employees, wives and mothers,  lives completely free of violence, like me.",但”Crazy Love”这本书出版之后， 很多男人和女人跟我诉说了他们的故事 他们也想告诉别人， 他们从发生的事情中学到了无价的一课， 他们重新开始了生活——开心快乐的生活—— 作为员工、妻子和母亲， 就像我现在一样生活，远离暴力。
Because it turns out that I'm actually a very typical domestic violence victim  and a typical domestic violence survivor.,实际上，我是典型的家庭暴力受害者， 也是典型的家庭暴力幸存者。
"I remarried a kind and gentle man,  and we have those three kids.",我和一个温柔善良男人再次结婚， 有了三个孩子。
"I have that black lab, and I have that minivan.",我养了一只黑色拉布拉多猎犬，开本田奥赛德面包车。
"What I will never have again,  ever,  is a loaded gun held to my head  by someone who says that he loves me.",而我永远不会再拥有的， 永远 是一个嘴里说爱我的人用 上膛了的枪指着我的脑袋。
"Right now, maybe you're thinking,  ""Wow, this is fascinating,""  or, ""Wow, how stupid was she,""  but this whole time, I've actually been talking about you.",此时此刻，你可能在想， 哇，这才神奇了， 或者，“喔，她真蠢，” 但是在整个过程中，事实上，我在谈论的是你。
I promise you there are several people  listening to me right now  who are currently being abused  or who were abused as children  or who are abusers themselves.,我敢保证，现在正在听我说话的人中 有一些人 正遭受着虐待 或者曾经在小时候被虐待过 或者你就是一个施虐者。
"Abuse could be affecting your daughter,  your sister, your best friend right now.",虐待可能正发生在你的女儿身上， 发生在你的姐妹、你最好的朋友身上。
I was able to end my own crazy love story  by breaking the silence.,我能够结束自己“疯狂的爱”的故事 靠的是打破沉默。
I'm still breaking the silence today.,今天我仍然在打破着沉默。

That's not me.","而是 由一群专业人士制出的图象, 发型师，化装师，摄影师，造型师 以及他们的助理，还有前期制作，后期制作 他们制造出了这些图象，而不是我"
"Okay, so the next question people always ask me is,  ""Do you get free stuff?""",下一个问题是 “你能得到免费的东西吗？”
"I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear,  except for earlier,  but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life, and that's what we don't like to talk about.",我确实有太多 从没机会穿的8英寸高跟鞋， 但是免费的东西 却是我在现实生活中得到的。而这恰恰是我们不愿意谈的

"but ""How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?""",而是“我要被停几次？我什么时候会被停？“

"So, the last question people ask me is,  ""What is it like to be a model?""",那么最后一个问题是 ”当模特是什么感觉？“
"And I think the answer that they're looking for is,  ""If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair,  you will be so happy and fabulous.""",我猜他们期待的答案是 ”如果你再瘦一点儿，你的头发再有光泽一些 你就会很开心，很难以置信“

"We say, ""It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work  with creative, inspired, passionate people.""",我们说”能到处旅行 和有创造力的，热情的，灵感不断的人一起工作真的很棒”

"And if you ever are wondering,  ""If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?""",如果你曾经也想过 如果我的大腿更瘦，头发更好，我会更开心吗？

"When I was writing this talk,  I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance, because on the one hand,  I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say,  ""Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor,""  and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with,  ""and it doesn't always make me happy.""",所以当我为这次演讲做准备时时，发现 很难为诚实找到一个平衡点。因为一方面 如果我站在这儿，说 ”看，我凭着天生的优势得到了这么多东西，”心里会不舒服 可是如果这句话接着 “可是这些都不能让我开心”也很不自在
But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression  when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.,但最难的是去展现 性别和种族歧视的职业传统 因为我自己本身是最大的受益者
"But I'm also happy and honored to be up here  before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career,  because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job,  or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college,  which seems so important right now.",但同时我又很开心并受尊重的站在这里 趁着我还年轻，而不是已经工作了10，20或30年 和模特行业间有越来越多的阻隔（不能获得最直接的感觉） 因为可能到那时我就不会讲我怎样得到第一份工作 怎样付大学学费 这些现在看来是如此重要的东西
"If there's a takeaway to this talk,  I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging  the power of image in our perceived successes  and our perceived failures.",如果这次演讲能使你有所受益，我希望 是我们都能欣然接受 图象的力量带来的我们所理解的成功 和我们所理解的失败

Thank you.,谢谢。
I would like to talk to you about  a very special group of animals.,我想和大家聊聊 一种非常不寻常的动物。
"There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.",地球上总共有一万种鸟类。
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.,秃鹫是他们中最濒临灭绝的一种。
"When you see a vulture like this, the first thing  that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly,  greedy creatures that are just after your flesh,  associated with politicians.    I want to change that perception. I want to change  those feelings you have for these birds, because  they need our sympathy. They really do.   And I'll tell you why.",每当你看到秃鹫就像这只，首先 浮现在你脑海中一定是，这是一些令人厌恶， 贪得无厌并且追逐腐肉的可怕生物， 让人禁不住联想到政客们。 我想改变这种看法。我想改变 大家对秃鹫的这些不好的联想，因为 他们需要我们的同情。他们真的很需要。 让我来告诉大家为什么。
"First of all, why do they have such a bad press?",首先，为什么他们会给我们留下这种坏印象呢？
"When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832  on the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture,  and he said, ""These are disgusting birds  with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity.""   You could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin.   You know, he changed his mind when he came back,  and I'll tell you why.","1832年 查尔斯 达尔文在搭乘贝格尔号穿越大西洋的 旅途中，发现了土耳其秃鹫， 他当时说道，“这些令人恶心的，长着猩红色 秃头的鸟儿们总是沉湎于腐肉中不可自拔."" 你很难找到比这更恶毒的侮辱了，这些话可是查尔斯 达尔文说的。 你们知道吗，达尔文返回英国之后就改变他的看法， 我马上会告诉你们为什么。"
"They've also be associated with Disney —  —  personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters.",秃鹫还曾经被迪斯尼看上—— 像高飞狗一样，被人格化，变成了麻木的，愚蠢的动画角色。
"More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press  —    —  these are the attributes that they associated  the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that.",而最近，如果你留意过肯尼亚的新闻 ——（欢呼）—— 肯尼亚的国会议员们被讽刺为像秃鹫一般 贪婪和愚蠢。但是我想叫板它。
I want to challenge that. Do you know why?,我要质疑它。你们知道为什么吗？
Because MPs  do not keep the environment clean.   MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases.,因为国会议员们 不能保持自然环境的清洁。 不能阻止疾病的传播。
"They are hardly monogamous.    They are far from being extinct.   And, my favorite is, vultures are better looking.    So there's two types of vultures in this planet.",几乎没人遵守一夫一妻制度。 他们离灭绝还很远。 并且，这条我最喜欢，秃鹫比议员们好看多了。 在这个世界上有两大类秃鹫。
"There are the New World vultures that are mainly found  in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras,  and then the Old World vultures, where we have  16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing  a high risk of extinction.",新大陆的秃鹫主要生长在 美洲大陆，像是美洲秃鹫和委内瑞拉秃鹫， 而在其他的大陆，那里 总共有16种秃鹫，他们中的11种正面临着 灭绝的风险。
"So why are vultures important? First of all,  they provide vital ecological services. They clean up.",所以为什么说秃鹫重要呢？首先， 秃鹫对生态循环做出了至关重要的作用。他们净化环境。
They're our natural garbage collectors.,秃鹫是我们的大自然垃圾清道夫。
They clean up carcasses right to the bone.,他们会把尸体上的肉吃的干干净净只剩白骨。
They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax  that would otherwise spread and cause  huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals.,他们能消灭所有尸体上的细菌，他们能吸收炭疽病毒 阻止病毒的传播与扩散 从而使大量的家畜和动物远离死亡和疾病。
"Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are  no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times  to decompose, and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases.",最近的研究还显示在那些 没有秃鹫生存的地区，尸体的分解会多花 三到四倍的时间，这给疾病的传播与扩散
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance.,提供了更多的机会。 秃鹫还有非常多的历史意义。
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture.,他们和古埃及文化有着密切的联系。
"Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector  and the motherhood, and together with the cobra,  symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt.",奈库贝特女神在古埃及文化中象征着监护人 和母性，通常和眼镜蛇女神维阿杰特一起出现， 象征着上埃及和下埃及的团结和统一。
"In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god,  and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita  from the 10-headed demon Ravana.",在印度教神话中，秃鹫之神名为雅达尤， 他冒着生命危险 从10头恶魔罗波那手中救出了西妲女神。
"In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important  sky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places  to bury the dead, or wood to cremate them,  so these vultures provide a natural disposal system.",在西藏文化中，秃鹫尤其显得重要 天葬。在那些类似西藏的地方，既没有条件 土葬，也没有木材去进行火葬， 所以秃鹫为当地人提供了一种天然的尸体处理系统。
So what is the problem with vultures?,那么秃鹫都面临着哪些问题呢？
"We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya,  of which six are highly threatened with extinction.",肯尼亚生长着八种秃鹫， 其中的六种正濒临灭绝。
"The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason  that they're getting poisoned is because there's  human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities  are using this poison to target predators,  and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this.",很多秃鹫被毒死，中毒的原因 是因为在肯尼亚正在发生的 人类与野生动物之间对于生存空间的争夺。牧人们 使用毒药来对付掠食动物， 掠食动物被毒死之后，秃鹫们随之成为了下一个受害者。
"In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan,  four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered,  which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct,  and the reason is because they are falling prey  by consuming livestock that has been treated  with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac.",在南亚，一些国家类似于印度和巴基斯坦， 四种秃鹫被列为极度濒临灭绝中， 这意味着在他们将会在10到15年之内彻底灭绝， 灭绝的原因是因为秃鹫们 食用了那些生前曾被喂食过 含有双氯芬酸成分止疼药的家畜。
"This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India,  and they have taken a stand.",现在含有双氯芬酸的兽药已经被禁止在印度使用， 印度政府表现出了积极的态度。
"Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread  in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites,  and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb  of rabies. The number of cases of rabies  has increased tremendously in India.",因为秃鹫数量的骤减，野狗开始 在牲畜尸体掩埋场周围泛滥成灾， 在野狗泛滥的地区，狂犬病就像定时炸弹一样 随时都会爆发。狂犬病案例的数量 在印度出现了惊人的增长。
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa:  353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana.,肯尼亚即将拥有全非洲最大规模的风力发电厂： 353台涡轮发电机即将被安装在图尔卡纳湖区。
"I am not against wind energy, but we need to work  with the governments, because wind turbines  do this to birds. They slice them in half.",我不反对开发风能，但是我们应该呼吁 政府重新考虑这项决定，因为风力涡轮机 会对鸟类造成威胁。高速的扇叶会把鸟儿“切”成两半。
They are bird-blending machines.,它们简直就是鸟类粉碎机。
"In West Africa, there's a horrific trade  of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market.",在西非，一些人毫无怜悯的叫卖 死去的秃鹫来满足巫术和收藏的需求。
"So what's being done? Well, we're conducting research  on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them.",我们正在做什么呢？我们正在研究 这些秃鹫。我们在它们身上安装定位器。
"We're trying to determine their basic ecology,  and see where they go.",我们试图去查明秃鹫与周围环境的关系 并且了解秃鹫的行踪。
"We can see that they travel different countries, so  if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you.",我们发现它们会在不同的国家之间旅行，所以 如果只是关注一个地区，你很难取得什么进展。
We need to work with governments in regional levels.,我们需要去和整个地区的政府们打交道。
We're working with local communities.,我们正努力与当地的居民们沟通。
"We're talking to them about appreciating vultures,  about the need from within to appreciate these  wonderful creatures and the services that they provide.",我们正在尽力让他们了解到秃鹫的益处， 并且发自内心得去感激这些 奇妙的生物和他们为自然所做的贡献。
"How can you help? You can become active,  make noise. You can write a letter to your government  and tell them that we need to focus on these very  misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time  to spread the word. Spread the word.",你们能做些什么呢？你们可以行动起来， 制造声势。你们可以写信给你们的政府 并且告诉他们，我们需要去关注这些被严重 误解的生物。花些时间 告诉你身边的人。尽可能多的人。
"When you walk out of this room, you will be informed  about vultures, but speak to your families, to your children,  to your neighbors about vultures.",当你走出这个房间的时候，你们就是 秃鹫达人了，不但要告诉你的家人们，还要 告诉你们的邻居们有关秃鹫的故事。
They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said  he changed his mind because he watched them fly  effortlessly without energy in the skies.,它们是那么的优雅。查尔斯 达尔文曾说到 他改变了自己的看法，在他看到秃鹫们在空中 优雅而又浑然天成的身姿之后。
"Kenya, this world, will be much poorer  without these wonderful species.",肯尼亚，全世界，都将会有很大的损失 如果失去了这些奇妙的物种。
Thank you very much.,非常感谢。（鼓掌）
"Everything I do, and everything I do professionally --  my life -- has been shaped  by seven years of work as a young man in Africa.",我所做的一切，不论是生活上还是工作上 我的整个人生--深深受到 年轻时在非洲工作的那七年的影响，

"So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia  in this absolutely magnificent valley  going down to the Zambezi River,  and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes  and zucchini and ...",所以，我们带着意大利的种子来到了赞比亚南部， 一个壮丽迷人的山谷， 通向赞比西河。 我们教当地人种植意大利西红柿 和西葫芦等等。
"And of course the local people had absolutely no interest  in doing that, so we paid them to come and work,  and sometimes they would show up.   And we were amazed that the local people, in such a fertile valley, would not have any agriculture.",当然，当地人对此表示毫无兴趣， 所以我们付工资请他们来劳作， 他们也是一会儿来一会儿不来的。 有着如此肥沃的山谷，当地人居然不耕种，
"But instead of asking them how come they were not  growing anything, we simply said, ""Thank God we're here.""   ""Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation.""",我们对此感到十分惊奇。 但我们并没有问他们原因， 而仅仅是感叹道：“幸亏我们来了。” “在饥饿的赞比亚人民命悬一线时伸出了援手。”

"We had these magnificent tomatoes. In Italy, a tomato  would grow to this size. In Zambia, to this size.",我们种的西红柿漂亮极了。在意大利，一个西红柿 长这么大。在赞比亚，能长这么大。
"And we could not believe, and we were telling the Zambians,  ""Look how easy agriculture is.""",这真是难以置信。我们跟赞比亚人说： “看，耕种多容易啊。”
"When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red,  overnight, some 200 hippos came out from the river  and they ate everything.   And we said to the Zambians, ""My God, the hippos!""",当西红柿成熟了，红彤彤的好看极了， 一夜之间，从赞比西河跑来两百多头河马 把所有西红柿都啃光了。 我们跟赞比亚人说：“天呐，这些该死的河马！”
"And the Zambians said, ""Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here.""   ""Why didn't you tell us?""""You never asked.""",赞比亚人说：“没错，这就是我们不在这里耕种的原因。” “你们为什么不早说？” “你又没问过。”
"I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa,  but then I saw what the Americans were doing,  what the English were doing, what the French were doing,  and after seeing what they were doing,  I became quite proud of our project in Zambia.",我本以为只有我们意大利人在非洲栽了跟头， 但当我知道美国人的情况， 英国人的情况，法国人的情况， 当看了他们的所作所为之后， 我为我们在赞比亚的项目感到非常自豪。

Can you help us?""",我让这五个渔民合伙运作， 不是把美味的金枪鱼以60美分一公斤的低价 卖给奥尔巴尼的罐头工厂， 而是以15美元一公斤的高价卖给日本做寿司。 接着又有农民跑来跟我说， “嘿，你帮助了他们，能帮帮我们吗？”

And I believe the key to opening that door  is great communication.,我相信打开那扇门的关键 就是要有很好的交流与沟通。
We desperately need great communication from our  scientists and engineers in order to change the world.,为了改变世界，我们迫切需要从我们的 科学家和工程师那里得到良好的沟通。
"Our scientists and engineers are the ones  that are tackling our grandest challenges, from energy  to environment to health care, among others,  and if we don't know about it and understand it,  then the work isn't done, and I believe it's our responsibility  as non-scientists to have these interactions.",我们的科学家和工程师们解决的都是 我们所面临的最大的难题，从能源 到环境再到卫生保健，等等。 如果我们不明白也不理解的话， 他们的工作对我们就没有什么意义了，并且我相信 我们作为非科学家们有责任与他们进行互动交流。
But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists  and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland.,可是如果我们的科学家和工程师们不把我们领进门 去看看他们的仙境的话，我们之间也就不可能有很好的交流。
"So scientists and engineers, please, talk nerdy to us.",所以科学家和工程师们，请跟我们说说高科技是什么吧。
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that  to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy  and that your engineering is engaging.,"我想来分享几个有用的方法，告诉你们如何才能保证 让我们也觉得你们的科学""性感""迷人、 你们的工程学魅力四射。"
First question to answer for us: so what?,第一个要回答我们的问题： 高科技又怎样？
Tell us why your science is relevant to us.,告诉我们，为什么你们的科学与我们有关。
"Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae,  but tell me that you study trabeculae, which is the mesh-like structure of our bones  because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis.",别光告诉我你们研究骨小梁， 要告诉我你们研究骨小梁是因为这种骨骼的网状组织 对认识和治疗骨质疏松症很重要。
"And when you're describing your science, beware of jargon.",另外当你们描述科学原理时，要注意术语的使用。
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas.,术语是我们理解你们想法的一个障碍。
"Sure, you can say ""spatial and temporal,"" but why not just say  ""space and time,"" which is so much more accessible to us?","当然了，你们可以说“空间性与瞬时性”，可是为什么不说 ""空间与时间""呢？这对我们来说容易理解多了。"
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down.,让你们的想法简单易懂并不等于简化它，
"Instead, as Einstein said, make everything  as simple as possible, but no simpler.",相反，正如爱因斯坦所说，让一切 尽可能的简单，而不是简化。
You can clearly communicate your science  without compromising the ideas.,你不必非得改变你的观点才能清楚地 传达出你的科学理论。
"A few things to consider are having examples, stories  and analogies. Those are ways to engage  and excite us about your content.",可以考虑用一些例子、故事、 还有类比。这些都是使你们的谈论内容 吸引我们、让我们兴奋的方法。
"And when presenting your work, drop the bullet points.",还有在用幻灯片演示你们的研究成果时，不要使用点句式。
"Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points?   What do bullets do? Bullets kill,  and they will kill your presentation.","你想过为什么点句式符号叫""子弹""点儿吗？ 子弹是干什么的？子弹能杀人， 也能灭了你的演示报告。"
"A slide like this is not only boring, but it relies too much  on the language area of our brain, and causes us to become overwhelmed.",像这样的幻灯片不仅仅乏味无聊，而且太过依赖 我们大脑的语言区，使我们不知所措。
"Instead, this example slide by Genevieve Brown is  much more effective. It's showing that the special structure  of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower.",而这张由Genevieve Brown制作的示例幻灯片 效果就好多了。它向我们说明骨小梁的特殊结构 超级强大，甚至连埃菲尔铁塔的独特设计
"And the trick here is to use a single, readable sentence  that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost,  and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses  and create a deeper sense of understanding  of what's being described.",都受到了它的启发。 这里的窍门就是使用简单、易读的句子， 让观众即使有点儿不明白也能够掌握要点， 然后接下来提供一些能够刺激我们感官的图像， 并且能让我们对所描述的内容 有更深层次的理解。
So I think these are just a few keys that can help  the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland  that is science and engineering.,以上这些就是我觉得能够帮助 我们大家打开那扇大门的钥匙，感受科学与工程学 仙境的好方法。
"And because the engineers that I've worked with have  taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd,  I want to summarize with an equation.   Take your science, subtract your bullet points  and your jargon, divide by relevance,  meaning share what's relevant to the audience,  and multiply it by the passion that you have for  this incredible work that you're doing,  and that is going to equal incredible interactions",那么因为与我共事过的工程师们教会我 接触我内心存在的学术狂人， 我想用一个方程式来总结一下我的观点。 用你们研究的科学，减去你们的点句式 和术语，除以相关内容， 就是要分享和观众有关的内容， 再乘以你对自己正在从事的 这份神奇工作的激情， 它就会等于：具备充分理解的、
that are full of understanding.,效果惊人的互动交流。
"And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved  this equation, by all means, talk nerdy to me.   Thank you.",因此，科学家和工程师们，当你们解决了 这个方程式以后，就想尽一切办法，跟我说说高科技吧。 谢谢。
"One of my favorite words in the whole of  the Oxford English Dictionary is ""snollygoster.""",我很喜欢的词之一 在整个牛津英语词典里叫“snollygoster”。
Just because it sounds so good.,不仅因为它听起来很不错。
"And what snollygoster means is  ""a dishonest politician.""",而且它的意思是 “一个诡诈的政客”。
"Although there was a 19th-century  newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said,  ""A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office  regardless of party, platform or principle,  and who, when he wins,  gets there by the sheer force  of monumental talknophical assumnancy.""",尽管这只是一个19世纪的 报纸编辑给出的一个很好的定义，他的原话： “‘snollygoster’是一个这样的家伙，他会为了谋求高位 而不在乎任何政党、任何舞台或任何原则， 他会用其三寸不烂之舌 口若悬河而赢得高位。”
"Now I have no idea what ""talknophical"" is.",我一点儿也不明白“talknophical”是什么意思。
"Something to do with words, I assume.",大概是和言语词汇相关的词汇，我假设。
"But it's very important that words are at the center of politics,  and all politicians know they have to try and control language.",但是言语词汇对于政治中心之作用是非常重要的， 并且所有的政客都明白他们必须尝试着控制他们的话语言论。
"It wasn't until, for example, 1771  that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to report  the exact words that were said in the debating chamber.",举例来说，一直到1771年， 英国议会才允许新闻报纸报道 在辩论会上政客们说的真实话语。
"And this was actually all down to the bravery  of a guy with the extraordinary name of Brass Crosby,  who took on Parliament.",而且实际上这全是因为一个勇敢的人， 这个伟大的名字叫布艾斯·克若斯比 ， 在议会上提议。
"And he was thrown into the Tower of London  and imprisoned,  but he was brave enough,  he was brave enough to take them on,  and in the end he had such popular support in London that he won.",他被丢到了伦敦塔里 遭到囚禁， 但是他还是很勇敢 拥有足够的勇气在议会上提议， 并且到最后他在伦敦拥有众多的支持声音而赢得了胜利。
"And it was only a few years later  that we have the first recorded use of the phrase  ""as bold as brass.""",而且仅仅几年后 我们有了第一次记录使用短语 “as bold as brass” （意译：敢作敢为）
Most people think that's down to the metal.,很多人认为这个短语出自于金属什么的。
It's not. It's down to a campaigner  for the freedom of the press.,不是的，它是出自于 一个新闻自由卫士。
"But to really show you how  words and politics interact,  I want to take you back to the United States of America,  just after they'd achieved independence.",不过为了真实的表明 词汇和政治怎样互相影响， 我想带你回到过去的美国， 在它刚刚宣布独立的时候。
"And they had to face the question  of what to call George Washington, their leader.","那时他们有一个问题要面对 就是怎样称号乔治·华盛顿, 他们的领袖。"
They didn't know.,他们不知道，
What do you call the leader of a republican country?,应该尊称一个共和国的领袖为什么？
And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages.,就这个问题在国会上争论了很久很久。
"And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table,  which might have made it.",并且产生了很多建议， 这些建议貌似可行。
"I mean, some people wanted him to be called  Chief Magistrate Washington,  and other people, His Highness George Washington,  and other people, Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington.",我的意思是，一些人想叫他为 首席行政官华盛顿， 而另一些人称他为乔治·华盛顿殿下， 还有人叫他美利坚联合政府自由解放的保卫者华盛顿。
Not that catchy.,没有一个朗朗上口的名字。
Some people just wanted to call him King.,一些人只是想叫他国王。
They thought it was tried and tested.,他们认为是个称号是过去用过并经过考验的。
"And they weren't even being monarchical there,  they had the idea that you could be elected King  for a fixed term.",他们甚至并没有延续君主制， 他们的主意是你可以是选举的国王 有一个固定的任期。
"And, you know, it could have worked.",你知道的，这样大概会可行。
"And everybody got insanely bored, actually,  because this debate went on for three weeks.",而且每一个人都感到神经错乱似地厌烦了，事实上， 因为这场辩论持续了3个礼拜。
"I read a diary of this poor senator,  who just keeps coming back, ""Still on this subject.""",我读过一个当时可怜议员的日记， 里面持续的记录着，“竟然又是这个议题。”
And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that  the House of Representatives were against the Senate.,而致使延期和厌倦的原因是 众议院对战参议院。
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington  to get drunk on power.,众议院不想让华盛顿 沉醉于权力。
"They didn't want to call him King  in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas.",他们不想称他为国王 以防万一他或他的继任者会产生什么想法。
"So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest,  most pathetic title that they could think of.",所以他们给他一个他们能够想到的，最低微的、最微不足道的、 最为可悲的头衔。
"And that title was ""President.""",而这个头衔叫“President”。
"President. They didn't invent the title. I mean, it existed before,  but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.",President （会议主持，总统）。他们没有创造这个头衔。我的意思是，这个头衔以前就有， 但是它是指一个会议的主持人。
It was like the foreman of the jury.,同陪审团主席的意思相似。
"And it didn't have much more grandeur  than the term ""foreman"" or ""overseer.""",并且它一点也不显得非常极其地位显赫 比起“foreman”和“overseer”来。
"There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils  and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title.",虽然偶尔会有一些小型殖民地的会议主持人 并有一丝政府管理的意思，但是它真的是个什么都不是的头衔。
And that's why the Senate objected to it.,而且这也是为什么参议院反对这个头衔。
"They said, that's ridiculous, you can't call him President.",他们说这个真的很荒谬，你们不能叫他会议主持。
This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries.,这个人还得去签条约和接见外宾。
And who's going to take him seriously  if he's got a silly little title  like President of the United States of America?,谁还会认真对待他， 如果他只有一个这样愚蠢的小头衔 比如美利坚联邦政府主持？
"And after three weeks of debate, in the end  the Senate did not cave in.",之后经过三周的辩论， 最后参议院也没有屈服。
"Instead, they agreed to use the title ""President"" for now,  but they also wanted it absolutely set down  that they didn't agree with it  from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations,  whether under republican or monarchical forms of government,  whose custom it is to annex,  through the office of the Chief Magistrate, titles of respectability --  not bloody President --  and that in the intercourse with foreign nations,",作为替代，他们同意先用着头衔“President”， 但他们也要求绝对确定下来 他们不同意这个头衔 是出于对文明国家的意见和做法的尊重， 无论是民主党还是共和党执政， 他们会自定义它， 通过首席行政官办公室，获得非常体面的头衔称号 - 而不是杯具的“President”- 还有在同外国交际时，
"the majesty of the people of the United States  may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity,  i.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos.",美利坚人们的威严 可能不会有被这个奇特头衔损害的危险， 即我们不想被后人看成一群杯具的变态。
Now you can learn three interesting things from this.,现在从这个故事里你能够了解到三件有趣的事情。
"First of all -- and this is my favorite --  is that so far as I've ever been able to find out,  the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President.",首先，也是我最喜欢的地方， 到目前为止所有我能找到的资料里， 参议院从来没有正式的认可过“总统”这个头衔。
"Barack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time,  just waiting for the Senate to spring into action.",巴拉克·奥巴马，“总统奥巴马”的头衔，到现在还是暂借的， 只是在一直等待参议院的突然正式任命。
Second thing you can learn is that  when a government says that this is a temporary measure --   --  you can still be waiting 223 years later.,第二件事你可以了解到 当美国政府宣称这只是一项临时措施时 -- -- 它会持续223年之久。
"But the third thing you can learn,  and this is the really important one,  this is the point I want to leave you on,  is that the title, President of the United States of America,  doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it?",但第三件事你能了解到的， 而且也是非常重要的一件， 我很想让你们记住这个要点， 就是这个头衔，美利坚联邦政府总统， 听起来从来也没有过地位低微的意思，不是吗？
"Something to do with the slightly over 5,000  nuclear warheads he has at his disposal  and the largest economy in the world  and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff.",大概是有着超过5000多的 核弹头被他支配控制着， 还有着全世界最大的经济体， 还有一大群战机及其他军事力量。
Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur.,现实和历史赋予了这个头衔高贵的含义。
And so the Senate won in the end.,所以最后参议院赢了。
They got their title of respectability.,他们得到了他们要的体面头衔。
"And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity --  well, it was a singularity back then.",而且，参议院担心的另一件事，这个头衔听起来很古怪 -- 哦，它曾经在那段时光听起来古怪。
"But now, do you know how many nations have a president?",但是现在，你知道现在有多少个国家有总统吗？
"All because they want to sound like  the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.",这都是因为他们想让自己的头衔听起来 像那个拥有5000多个核弹头的家伙，等等。
"And so, in the end, the Senate won  and the House of Representatives lost,  because nobody's going to feel that humble  when they're told that they are now  the President of the United States of America.",所以到最后，参议院胜利了 众议院输了， 因为没有人会感到不体面 当他们被告知他们现在是 美利坚联邦政府总统。
"And that's the important lesson I think you can take away,  and the one I want to leave you with.",而且这是很重要的一课我认为你们能够学到的， 也是我想留给你们的要点。
"Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality  and control reality, but in fact,  reality changes words far more  than words can ever change reality.",政客们小心翼翼地选择用词，并利用词汇塑造 和控制现实，但是事实上， 现实改变词汇远远超过 词汇能改变的现实。
Thank you very much.,非常感谢。

"As we started down the path, we pushed aside the vines  blocking the way, and after about an hour of walking in,  found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains,  so I hoisted the photo gear above my head  After another two hours of hiking, the winding trail  abruptly ended at a clearing, and before us  was a mass of holes  that could fit into the size of a football field,",我们拨开挡路的藤蔓 徒步走了约一个小时 小径被近期的雨水淹没了 我把拍摄器材举过头顶 趟着齐胸口深的水继续走 又走了两个小时 蜿蜒的小径戛然而止 我们面前的空地上出现了一大片坑洞

Thank you very much.,谢谢大家
"So, well, I do applied math,  for anyone who does applied math, is that  we are like management consultants.",话说，我是学应用数学的 对于每一个学应用数学的人来说 有一个特殊的难题，就是 我们和管理顾问都很像
No one knows what the hell we do.,没人知道我们是干嘛的
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today  to try and explain to you what I do.,所以我今天会给你们一些实例 来解释我们是干什么的
"So, dancing is one of the most human of activities.",嗯，跳舞是人类众多的活动之一
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers  you will see later on.,我们会因芭蕾舞大师和踢踏舞蹈者而感到欣悦 稍后你们就会知道了
"Now, ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise  and a high level of skill,  and probably a level of initial suitability  that may well have a genetic component to it.",如今芭蕾需要非凡的专业知识 和杰出的专业技巧 甚至一定的初级适应性 这可能就是所说的天赋
"Now, sadly, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease  gradually destroy this extraordinary ability,  as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling, who was  a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time.",不过，可悲的是，神经系统疾病，例如帕金森症 慢慢地在摧毁这一卓越的才能 这正发生在我的朋友Jan Striling身上 他曾是他那个时代的芭蕾舞大师
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years.,这些年他接受过很多治疗也有很大的进步
"However, there are 6.3 million people worldwide  who have the disease, and they have to live with  incurable weakness, tremor, rigidity  and the other symptoms that go along with the disease,  so what we need are objective tools  to detect the disease before it's too late.",然而，世上有630万的人 患有这种疾病，而且他们还得忍受 无法治愈的虚弱，震颤，僵化 等其他伴随而来的症状的折磨 所以我们需要客观的工具 在病重之前将之检测出来
"We need to be able to measure progression objectively,  and ultimately, the only way we're going to know  when we actually have a cure is when we have  an objective measure that can answer that for sure.",我们需要客观地测量进展 最后，想要知道何时有治愈之方的唯一方法 就是当我们 拥有了能准确回答那些问题的客观测量法
"But frustratingly, with Parkinson's disease  and other movement disorders, there are no biomarkers,  so there's no simple blood test that you can do,  and the best that we have is like  this 20-minute neurologist test.",但令人泄气的是，帕金森症 和其他运动障碍疾病，都没有生物标志物 所以你没法做简单的血液检查 我们能做到的最好的 就是像这个20分钟的神经学测试
"You have to go to the clinic to do it. It's very, very costly,  and that means that, outside the clinical trials,  it's just never done. It's never done.",你必须得到诊所去，而且花费相当相当大 这也意味着，在临床试验之外 从来没人做过这个测试，从来没有
But what if patients could do this test at home?,但如果病人能在家完成这个测试呢？
"Now, that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic,  and what if patients could do that test themselves, right?",这也能为病人节省下那段去诊所的路程 如果病人能独立完成这个测试呢？
No expensive staff time required.,就不需要花大量的钱去雇佣员工
"Takes about $300, by the way, in the neurologist's clinic to do it.",顺便提下，如果去神经科诊所做的话
"So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way  in which we can try to achieve this,  because, you see, in one sense, at least,  we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling.",这个费用要300美金 所以我想向你们提出一个非常规的的方法 一个我们能尝试去达到目的的方法 因为你也知道，在某种意义上，至少 我们都是像我朋友Jan Stripling一样的艺术大师
So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds.,我这里有一个关于声襞颤动的视频
"Now, this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds,  and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers,  because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs  when we make sounds, and we all actually  have the genes for it. FoxP2, for example.",这个是健康状态下的某人在发声 我们把自己想当作是声音的芭蕾舞者 因为当我们发声时 我们得去协调这些发声器官，确实 这些是与生俱来的，例如Foxp2基因
"And like ballet, it takes an extraordinary level of training.",而且和芭蕾一样，这也需要经过特殊地训练
"I mean, just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak.",可以想一想，小孩学说话得花多长时间
"From the sound, we can actually track  the vocal fold position as it vibrates,  and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson's,  so too are the vocal organs.",从声音里，我们可以追寻到 声襞颤动时的位置 正如帕金森能影响我们四肢 它也能影响我们发声器官
"So on the bottom trace, you can see an example of  irregular vocal fold tremor.",你可以看到底部的颤动轨迹 是一种不规则的声襞颤动
We see all the same symptoms.,我们看到了一样的症状
"We see vocal tremor, weakness and rigidity.",声音颤动，虚弱，和僵化
"The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy  after a while, and that's one of the example symptoms of it.",讲话会变得小声而且之后伴随更多气息音 这些都是症状的例子
"So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle,  in some cases, but with any digital microphone,  and using precision voice analysis software  in combination with the latest in machine learning,  which is very advanced by now,  we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies  on a continuum between health and disease  using voice signals alone.",事实上，这些声效大部分时候挺难以捉摸的 但只要有任何一款数码麦克风 搭上精密的声音分析软件 再组合用上最新的目前已非常先进的 机器研究 现在我们就能准确地定量 他人处于健康和疾病这一直线上的位置 这仅仅只需要语音信号而已
"So these voice-based tests, how do they stack up against  expert clinical tests? We'll, they're both non-invasive.",那么这些以语音为基础的测试，他们会怎样 与专业的临床测试展开较量呢？其实他们都是无创技术
The neurologist's test is non-invasive. They both use existing infrastructure.,神经学测试是无创性的，而且他们都使用现有的基础设备
You don't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it.,你无需去设计一系列新的医院来完成测试
"And they're both accurate. Okay, but in addition,  voice-based tests are non-expert.",他们也都具有精确性。虽然这么说，但是 基于语音的测试却不是专家级别的
That means they can be self-administered.,这意味着患者能自己搞定
"They're high-speed, take about 30 seconds at most.",而且速度也快，最多只要30秒
"They're ultra-low cost, and we all know what happens.",价格很低，我们也知道是怎么一回儿事
"When something becomes ultra-low cost,  it becomes massively scalable.",一旦价格低廉 它也就能被大规模地扩展
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now.,我这儿有些现在能拿出来说的伟大的目标
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients.,我们能减少和病人有关的后勤问题
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup.,没必要去诊所做例行的检查
We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data.,我们能进行高频率的监测以获取客观数据
"We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials,  and we can make population-scale screening  feasible for the first time.",我们能为临床试验组织大量征召且耗费很低 我们也能使人数的规模的展示 在第一时间变得可行
We have the opportunity to start to search  for the early biomarkers of the disease before it's too late.,我们也有机会开始寻找 这种疾病在病入膏肓前的早期生物标志物
"So, taking the first steps towards this today,  we're launching the Parkinson's Voice Initiative.",所以，从今天开始朝这个方向迈出第一步 我们开始了Parkinson's Voice Initiative这个项目
"With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe, we're aiming  to record a very large number of voices worldwide  to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals.",和Aculab还有PatientsLikeMe一起合作，我们希望 记录下大量世界各地的声音 收集足够的数据来达到这四个目标
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters  of a billion people on the planet.,我们的市话号码能接通地球上 7亿5000万人的来电
"Anyone healthy or with Parkinson's can call in, cheaply,  and leave recordings, a few cents each,  and I'm really happy to announce that we've already hit  six percent of our target just in eight hours.",任何健康或者患有帕金森疾病的人都能打进来，很便宜 留下录音，每次只要几分钱 我很高兴宣布我们仅在8小时内 就达到了我们目标的6%
"Thank you.     Tom Rielly: So Max, by taking all these samples of,  let's say, 10,000 people,  you'll be able to tell who's healthy and who's not?",谢谢  Tom Rielly: Max，靠着这些采样 不妨说，在一万人中 你能够辨别出谁是健康的，谁是患病的？
What are you going to get out of those samples?,你又想从这些采样中得出什么呢？
"Max Little: Yeah. Yeah. So what will happen is that,  during the call you have to indicate whether or not  you have the disease or not, you see. TR: Right.",Max Little:对，是的。所以是这样的 在来电期间，你得告诉我们 你是否患有这种疾病。TR：嗯
"ML: You see, some people may not do it. They may not get through it.",ML:要知道，有些人可能不会打给我们，或者没接通
"But we'll get a very large sample of data that is collected  from all different circumstances, and it's getting it  in different circumstances that matter because then  we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors,  and looking for the actual markers of the disease.",但我们还是会得到大量 来自不同环境下的采样数据 而且重点是不同的环境，因为这样 我们才能消除掉那些混淆的因素 寻求这种疾病真正的标记
TR: So you're 86 percent accurate right now?,TR:所以你现在拥有86%的准确率了？
ML: It's much better than that.,ML:已经远远不止了
"Actually, my student Thanasis, I have to plug him,  because he's done some fantastic work,  and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well,  which enables this project, and we're getting 99 percent accuracy.",事实上，我的学生Thanasis，我得提一下他 因为他做出一些出色的成果 现在他已经证明了在移动电话网上也能进行这个项目 所以现在我们接近99%的准确率了
"TR: Ninety-nine. Well, that's an improvement.",TR:九十九，好吧，这还挺了不起的
"So what that means is that people will be able to —  ML:   TR: People will be able to call in from their mobile phones  and do this test, and people with Parkinson's could call in,  record their voice, and then their doctor can check up  on their progress, see where they're doing in this course of the disease.",所以这也意味着人们能—— ML: TR:人们能用手机打进你们的电话 然后做这项测试，帕金森病人也能打通电话 然后记录下声音，之后他们的医生就能检查他们的进展 确定他们处于这种疾病的哪个阶段
ML: Absolutely.,ML:就是这样
"TR: Thanks so much. Max Little, everybody.",TR:非常感谢，Max Little和所有人
"ML: Thanks, Tom.",ML:谢谢你Tom

"I, along with hundreds of other volunteers,  knew we couldn't just sit at home,  so I decided to join them for three weeks.",我和其他百余名志愿者 都深知：我们不能在家干等着。 因此我也决定加入他们的行列，做3周志愿救援活动。
"On May the 13th, I made my way to the town of Ōfunato.",5月13日，我来到日本大船渡县，
"It's a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture,  about 50,000 people,  one of the first that was hit by the wave.",那是日本岩手县的一个小渔村， 人口大约只有5万人， 是当时第一波受灾的地方。
"The waters here have been recorded at reaching  over 24 meters in height,  and traveled over two miles inland.",当时的海啸洪峰最高时刻 高达逾24米， 冲击到内陆足足有2英里的地方。
"As you can imagine, the town had been devastated.",你可以想象，这个小镇肯定备受摧残。
We pulled debris from canals and ditches.,我们拨开运河和水沟里的瓦砾，
We cleaned schools. We de-mudded and gutted homes  ready for renovation and rehabilitation.,我们帮助学校和那些被埋没的房屋打扫、清理， 以便重建、翻新。

"As they had run from the wave, and for their lives,  absolutely everything they had,  everything had to be left behind.",当他们遭受海啸袭击之时，可想而知，必然四处奔波，寻求一线生机， 自然把其他东西， 他们的所有东西都抛诸脑后。
"At the end of my first week there, I found myself  helping out in an evacuation center in the town.",我呆在日本的第一周的最后几天，我发现自己 在帮该镇的一个疏散中心，
"I was helping clean the onsen, the communal onsen,  the huge giant bathtubs.",帮助一个公社温泉清扫 社里的巨大浴盆。

"This is where people were handing them in,  and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me  to help them start hand-cleaning them.",人们把收集到的照片送到那个公社温泉， 当时我十分有幸得到了他们的信任， 让我开始清洗、还原那些照片。
"Now, it was emotional and it was inspiring,  and I've always heard about thinking outside the box,  but it wasn't until I had actually gotten outside of my box  that something happened.",那些时刻令人触动，也非常有激励意义， 我一直听人们说：要有创意！ 直到那时清理那些照片，我才真的做到了 所谓的“创新”。
"As I looked through the photos, there were some  were over a hundred years old,  some still in the envelope from the processing lab,  I couldn't help but think as a retoucher  that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch,  and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same.",当我翻看那些照片时，有些 甚至有逾百年的历史， 有些仍被保存在加工实验室的信封里， 我不禁从一个修图师的角度思考， 或许我可以帮他们修复这些被撕破和被划痕的照片， 而且我也认识很多会修图的人可以帮他们复原这些照片。
"So that evening, I just reached out on Facebook  and asked a few of them, and by morning  the response had been so overwhelming and so positive,  I knew we had to give it a go.",所以，当天傍晚，我就登陆脸谱网 问了一些修图师朋友，还没到第二天早上， 就有很多很多回复消息，说他们乐意帮忙， 我知道我们应该行动起来，
So we started retouching photos.,于是我们就开始了修图行动。
This was the very first.,这是初次尝试（的一张照片）。
"Not terribly damaged, but where the water had caused  that discoloration on the girl's face  had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy.",还不算毁坏得太严重，但是被水浸没的地方 导致照片中小女孩的脸掉色了， 我们不得不精心修复，做到十分精确，
"Otherwise, that little girl isn't going to look  like that little girl anymore, and surely that's as tragic  as having the photo damaged.",否则，小女孩的脸就不会 看上去像她的脸了——那多悲剧啊， 就跟毁了照片一样。
"Over time, more photos came in, thankfully,  and more retouchers were needed,  and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn,  and within five days, 80 people wanted to help  from 12 different countries.",随着时间推移，越来越多需要修复的照片被运送过来， 我们也需要更多修图师来帮忙处理这些照片， 于是我又登陆脸谱网和职业链接网站寻求帮助， 仅仅5天，就有80位修图师表示愿意来帮忙， 他们来自12个不同的国家。
"Within two weeks, I had 150 people  wanting to join in.",两周内，我共得到150位志愿者的答复， 他们表示愿意加入我们的行列。

"Once a week, we would set up our scanning equipment  in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up,  where people were reclaiming their photos.",每周，我们都在 临时照相馆里架起扫描设备， 人们前来这些临时照相馆领回他们的照片。
"The older ladies sometimes hadn't seen a scanner before,  but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo,  they could give it to us, have it scanned,  uploaded to a cloud server, it would be downloaded  by a gaijin, a stranger,  somewhere on the other side of the globe,  and it'd start being fixed.",有时候，一些年长的女士从未见过扫描仪， 待她们找到自己遗失的照片后，在十分钟内， 她们可以把照片给我们进行扫描， 然后上传至云端服务器，之后上传的照片 可能会被一个非日本人、或陌生人下载， 他们可能来自地球的另一端， 那时照片就开始被修复。
"The time it took, however, to get it back  is a completely different story,  and it depended obviously on the damage involved.",然而，那时，他们再要拿回这些照片所需花的时间 就截然不同了， 当然，这取决于受损程度，
It could take an hour. It could take weeks.,可能一小时就能修复好，也可能需要长达几周，
It could take months.,甚至几个月。
"The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn,  or pieced together, picking out the remaining parts of color  and detail that the water hadn't damaged.",照片中美丽的和服必须通过手绘处理， 或者一点一点拼接而成，再配上掉了的颜色， 把那些没有被水冲坏的地方进行细节处理。
It was very time-consuming.,整个过程非常费时。
"Now, all these photos had been damaged by water,  submerged in salt water, covered in bacteria,  in sewage, sometimes even in oil, all of which over time  is going to continue to damage them,  so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project.",所有这些受海啸影响的照片， 在盐水里浸泡，受细菌侵蚀， 又埋没在垃圾里，有时甚至被油污浸染，所有这些 经过一段时间都会持续破坏这些照片， 因此手工清洗照片是这个项目的一个重大组成部分。

She had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped  when she realized she was doing more damage.,她也开始自己亲手清洗照片，直到 她意识到她自己清洗其实对照片造成了更多损害。
She also had duplicates.,好在她有照片的备份，
"Areas like her husband and her face, which otherwise  would have been completely impossible to fix,  we could just put them together in one good photo,  and remake the whole photo.",否则，照片里，她和她先生的脸部 就无法完全修复了。 我们也因此得以把所有部分整合到一张好的相片里， 然后重新制作这张照片。

"For her, despite all of this, those photos  were the perfect gift back to him,  something he could look at again, something he remembered from before  that wasn't still scarred from that day in March  when absolutely everything else in his life had changed  or been destroyed.",对她来说，尽管悲催的灾难和种种艰辛，那些照片 是给他儿子最好的礼物， 这些照片让他可以重新翻阅，重拾记忆， 那不再是三月的某一天给他留下的烙印， 当他生活中的一切都发生了改变， 或者说其实是被摧毁了。
"After six months in Japan,  1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands,  hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean  over 135,000 photographs,  the large majority —  —  a large majority of which did actually find their home again,  importantly.","在日本呆了6个月以后， “携手志愿者”共有1,100名志愿者加入帮助日本救灾， 其中几百名帮我们手工清洗 超过13.5万张照片， 其中的大部分———— 其中大部分最终回到了失主手里， 这一点也异常重要。"
"Over five hundred volunteers around the globe  helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back,  fully restored and retouched.",全球超过500名志愿者 帮我们找回了90个家庭的数百张照片， 这些照片全部被复原、修复。
"During this time, we hadn't really spent more than  about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials,  most of which was printer inks.",在这期间，我们没有为 设备或材料花上千元美金， 大部分是用打印机墨水完成的。

Thank you.,谢谢各位！
"with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple,  and exposure just a millionth of a second.",爱哲顿博士用这张子弹击穿苹果的照片 激起了我们的敬佩和好奇， 这张照片的曝光时间只有一百万分之一秒。
"But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster  and see the world not at a million or a billion,  but one trillion frames per second.",但现在，五十年后，我们可以再快一百万倍， 也就是不仅在一百万分之一秒， 或者十亿分之一秒， 而是在万亿分之一秒见捕捉到世界。
"I present to you a new type of photography,  femto-photography,  a new imaging technique so fast  that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion.",现在我给你展示一种新型照相技术， 叫做飞秒成像， 这是一种技术太快以至于 它能捕捉到光的运动。
"And with that, we can create cameras that can look around corners,  beyond line of sight,  or see inside our body without an x-ray,  and really challenge what we mean by a camera.",所以用这个技术，我们可以制造 能看到光路拐角的照相机， 能看到视野之外 或者不用X光就能透视我们身体的照相机， 这种相机挑战了我们关于照相机的定义。
Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off  in one trillionth of a second --  which is several femtoseconds --  I'll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide.,现在，如果我用一个激光笔， 并且在万亿分之一秒内开关一次—— 也就是几飞秒—— 我就会制造一些光子， 这些光子仅仅是几毫米宽，
"And that packet of photons, that bullet,  will travel at the speed of light,  and again, a million times faster than an ordinary bullet.",并且这些光子，像子弹一样， 会以光速前进， 也就是比子弹速度高一百万倍。
"Now, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons  and fire into this bottle,  how will those photons shatter into this bottle?",现在，如果你把这个子弹，这些光子 打入这个瓶子里， 这些光子会怎么样撞击瓶子？
How does light look in slow motion?,光在慢动作下会是什么样？
"[Light in Slow Motion ... 10 Billion x Slow] Now, the whole event --    Now remember, the whole event is effectively taking place  in less than a nanosecond --  that's how much time it takes for light to travel.",现在，着整个事情—— （鼓掌） （鼓掌） 现在，请记住，这整个事情 其实是在一纳秒内发生的 ——也就是光走的时间——
"But I'm slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion,  so you can see the light in motion.",但现在我再把这个录像放慢一百万倍 让你看到运动中的光。
"But Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research.   Now, there's a lot going on in this movie,  so let me break this down and show you what's going on.",但可口可乐可没有资助这个实验。  现在，在这里有很多事会发生， 所以让我一件一件的展示。
"So the pulse enters the bottle, our bullet,  with a packet of photons that start traveling through  and that start scattering inside.",现在，光束进入瓶子，也就是我们的子弹， 穿过瓶子， 并且在内部散射开来。
"Some of the light leaks, goes on the table,  and you start seeing these ripples of waves.",一些光流了出来，到了桌子上， 所以你开始看到这些波纹。
Many of the photons eventually reach the cap  and then they explode in various directions.,许多光子最终到达了瓶盖处 并且向四周散去。
"As you can see, there's a bubble of air  and it's bouncing around inside.",你能看到，这里是一个空气泡， 它在里面反弹。
"Meanwhile, the ripples are traveling on the table,  and because of the reflections at the top,  you see at the back of the bottle, after several frames,  the reflections are focused.",同时，波纹也到了桌子上， 并且因为在顶部的反射， 你能看到在瓶子底部，几帧之后， 反射汇聚了。
"Now, if you take an ordinary bullet  and let it go the same distance and slow down the video --  again, by a factor of 10 billion --  do you know how long you'll have to sit here to watch that movie?",现在，如果你用普通的子弹 走同样的路程，平且放慢视频， 同样是一百万倍，你知道 你需要等多久来看到这个全过程吗？
"A day, a week? Actually, a whole year.",一天，一周？实际上，是一年。
"It'll be a very boring movie --   of a slow, ordinary bullet in motion.",这当然会很无聊  一个慢的，普通的子弹运动录像。
And what about some still-life photography?,但一些静物照相又如何呢？
"You can watch the ripples, again, washing over the table,  the tomato and the wall in the back.",你可以又一次看到波纹在桌子上展开， 背景是西红柿和墙。
It's like throwing a stone in a pond of water.,这就像在水池里扔一块石头。
"I thought: this is how nature paints a photo,  one femto frame at a time,  but of course our eye sees an integral composite.",我想，这就是自然如何绘制的西红柿， 一飞秒一飞秒， 但当然我们眼睛看到的是整体的结合。
"But if you look at this tomato one more time,  you will notice, as the light washes over the tomato,  it continues to glow. It doesn't become dark. Why is that?",但如果你在看一下这个西红柿， 你就会注意到，当光在西红柿上走过时， 它一直在闪耀。它并没有变暗。
"Because the tomato is actually ripe,  and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato,  and it comes out after several trillionths of a second.",为什么？因为西红柿熟了， 并且光在西红柿内部反射， 在几万亿分之一秒后出来。
"So in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone,  you might be able to go to a supermarket  and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it.",所以，在未来，当飞米成像相机 在你的手机里的时候， 你就可以去超市， 不用摸就能检查一下水果是否熟了。
So how did my team at MIT create this camera?,那么，我在麻省理工学院的团队是怎么做出这个相机的呢？
"Now, as photographers, you know,  if you take a short exposure photo, you get very little light.",现在，作为摄影师，你知道， 如果你想要短时曝光，你只有一点点光，
"But we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure,  so you're going to get hardly any light.",但我们需要比最短的曝光时间 快一百万倍， 所以你几乎得不到任何光。
"So what we do is we send that bullet --  that packet of photons -- millions of times,  and record again and again with very clever synchronization,  and from the gigabytes of data,  we computationally weave together  to create those femto-videos I showed you.",所以，我们做的是， 把这些光子送进去，并重复百万多次， 每次都以极好的同步录像， 然后从几个GB的数据中， 我们“编织”起来一幅图， 而这幅图就是你们之前看到的。
And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways.,并且我们把所有的原始数据到算进去时， 进行很有趣的处理。
"So, Superman can fly.",现在，超人能飞。
Some other heroes can become invisible.,一些其他英雄能隐身，
But what about a new power for a future superhero:  To see around corners.,但想象一个未来的超人： 他能看到拐角后面的东西。
"The idea is that we could shine some light on the door,  it's going to bounce, go inside the room,  some of that is going to reflect back on the door,  and then back to the camera.",这原理是我们可以把一些光打到门上， 这些光会反射进入房间， 一些会返回到门上， 然后进入照相机，
And we could exploit these multiple bounces of light.,这样我们就可以利用这些光的反射。
And it's not science fiction. We have actually built it.,这可不是科幻片。我们真正的做出来了。
"On the left, you see our femto-camera.",在左边，你看到了我们的飞秒成像相机。
"There's a mannequin hidden behind a wall,  and we're going to bounce light off the door.",在墙后面有一个人体模型， 我们将进行光反射。
"So after our paper was published in Nature Communications,  it was highlighted by Nature.com,  and they created this animation.",所以，在我们的论文发表 在《自然》上后， 它被推荐到自然的官网上， 然后他们创造了这个动画。
"Ramesh Raskar: We're going to fire those bullets of light,  and they're going to hit this wall,  and because of the packet of the photons,  they will scatter in all the directions,  and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin,  which in turn will again scatter that light,  and again in turn, the door will reflect some of that scattered light.",我们将要发射这些光子弹， 它们将要撞击这个墙， 并且因为这束光 会散射到各个方向， 一些会最终打到我们的隐藏的假人上， 并且会继续散射， 知道这个门也会反射 一些光，
"And a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera,  but most interestingly,  they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot.",而一部分光会最终 返回到相机里，但最有趣的是， 他们会在略微不同的时间到达。
And because we have a camera that can run so fast --  our femto-camera -- it has some unique abilities.,而且因为我们有一个可以运行如此之快的相机， 也就是我们的飞秒相机，这个相机就有一些特别的能力。
"It has very good time resolution,  and it can look at the world at the speed of light.",它有很好的时间分辨率， 并且可以以光速捕捉世界。
"And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door,  but also to the hidden objects,  but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance.",所以这样，我们不仅知道相机到门的距离， 同时知道到隐藏物品的距离， 但我们不知道哪个点 对应哪个距离。
"By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo,  which, if you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense.",通过用激光，我们能记录一个原始的照片， 也就是你们在屏幕上看到的这个，好像没什么意义，
"But then we will take a lot of such pictures,  dozens of such pictures, put them together,  and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light,  and from that, can we see the hidden object?",但然后我们会拍很多照片， 很多很多，放到一起， 然后分析光的反射， 现在我们能看到那个隐藏的物体了吗？
Can we see it in full 3D?,我们能立体的看懂吗？
So this is our reconstruction.,这就是我们的模型重建。
"Now, we have some ways to go  before we take this outside the lab on the road,  but in the future, we could create cars that avoid collisions with what's around the bend.",现在我们在把他们应用到生活中 还有一些路要走， 但在未来，我们可以把这个技术放到车里， 这样车就能防止碰撞，因为他们能看到拐角，
Or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions  by looking at light reflected through open windows.,或者我们可以搜寻幸存者， 因为我们能看到在窗户上反射的光，
"Or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders,  and also for cardioscopes.",或者我们可以建造透视仪， 来看到身体里的情况，
"But of course, because of tissue and blood,  this is quite challenging,  so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto-photography  as really a new imaging modality  to solve the next generation of health-imaging problems.",我们甚至可以透视心脏。 但当然，由于各种组织和血液的干扰， 这回相当困难， 所以我们呼吁科学家来真正重视飞秒成像， 把这个技术作为一种 解决下一代健康问题的新模型。
"Now, like Doc Edgerton, a scientist himself,  science became art -- an art of ultra-fast photography.",现在，就像爱哲顿博士，一个科学家， 科学变成了艺术，一种高速摄影艺术，
"And I realized  that all the gigabytes of data that we're collecting every time,  are not just for scientific imaging.",而且我意识到我们每次 收集到的大量资料 不仅是科学成像，
"But we can also do a new form of computational photography,  with time-lapse and color coding.",而且还是一种新的计算性摄影， 这种技术蕴含了时间延迟和彩色编码，
And we look at those ripples.,我们看这些波纹。
Remember:  The time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second.,记住，这些波纹之间的时间 仅仅是几个万亿分之一秒。
But there's also something funny going on here.,但有些有趣的事正在发生，
"When you look at the ripples under the cap,  the ripples are moving away from us.",当你看到这些盖子下的波纹时， 他们正在离我们远去。
The ripples should be moving towards us.,但这些波纹应该向我们移动。
What's going on here?,发生了什么？
"It turns out, because we're recording nearly at the speed of light,  we have strange effects,  and Einstein would have loved to see this picture.",结果是，因为我们在以接近光速 来录这些东西， 我们有一些奇怪的现象， 爱因斯坦会相当高兴看到这些图片。
The order at which events take place in the world  appears in the camera sometimes in reversed order.,事件发生的顺序 在相机里有时候被反转了，
"So by applying the corresponding space and time warp,  we can correct for this distortion.",所以通过对应时间和空间的扭曲， 我们可以修正这个扭曲。
"So whether it's for photography around corners,  or creating the next generation of health imaging,  or creating new visualizations,  since our invention,  we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website,  and our hope is that the DIY, the creative and the research communities  will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras --   and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging.",所以不管是看到拐角， 还是为下一代制造健康影像， 还是增加新的可视化， 自从我们的发明， 我们就已经把所有的资料和细节放到了我们的网上， 并且我们希望，这个DIY，这个创意的研究团体， 可以告诉我们 我们不应该再迷上高像素———— 而开始关注成像技术的另一个维度。

"I was about 10 years old  on a camping trip with my dad  in the Adirondack Mountains, a wilderness area  in the northern part of New York State.",我10岁左右的时候， 有一次和爸爸一起去 阿第伦达克山脉露营。那是一片 位于纽约州北部的野生地带。
It was a beautiful day.,那天天气特别好。
The forest was sparkling.,森林里处处闪闪发光。
"The sun made the leaves glow like stained glass,  and if it weren't for the path we were following,  we could almost pretend we were  the first human beings to ever walk that land.",阳光照耀下，树叶闪闪地象晶莹的彩色玻璃。 如果没有脚下的小路， 我们完全可以假装我们是 首批到达这片树林的人类。
We got to our campsite.,我们最终到达了我们的营地。
"It was a lean-to on a bluff  looking over a crystal, beautiful lake,  when I discovered a horror.",那是一个在悬崖上的营地， 可以向下俯瞰一个水晶般晶莹美丽的湖泊。 后来我却发现了很糟糕的事。
"Behind the lean-to was a dump,  maybe 40 feet square  with rotting apple cores  and balled-up aluminum foil,  and a dead sneaker.",就在悬崖营地的后面， 有个足足有 40 英尺见方的大垃圾堆。 里面有烂苹果核、 用过的铝箔纸、 和破旧的运动鞋。
"And I was astonished,  I was very angry, and I was deeply confused.",我当时非常吃惊， 非常生气，也非常非常困惑。
"The campers who were too lazy  to take out what they had brought in,  who did they think would clean up after them?",来露营的人实在太懒了， 连自己带来的垃圾都不肯收拾。 他们觉得谁会替他们清理善后呢？
"That question stayed with me,  and it simplified a little.",这个问题一直困扰着我。 成了一个更精练的问题。
Who cleans up after us?,谁来清理我们留下的垃圾？
"However you configure  or wherever you place the us,  who cleans up after us in Istanbul?",但是你可以把这个问题 放在任何你生活的地方。 在伊斯坦布清理我们留下的垃圾？
Who cleans up after us in Rio  or in Paris or in London?,在里约清理我们留下的垃圾？ 在巴黎或伦敦呢？
"Here in New York,  the Department of Sanitation cleans up after us,  to the tune of 11,000 tons of garbage  and 2,000 tons of recyclables every day.","在纽约，这里， 是环卫部门清理我们留下的 多达11,000吨的垃圾 和每天2000吨的可回收垃圾。"
I wanted to get to know them as individuals.,我个人想去了解这些环卫工人，
I wanted to understand who takes the job.,我想知道谁在做这样的工作。
What's it like to wear the uniform  and bear that burden?,穿上环卫服 承担起这份责任的感觉是什么样？
So I started a research project with them.,所以我开始了一项关于环卫工人的研究课题。
"I rode in the trucks and walked the routes  and interviewed people in offices and facilities  all over the city,  and I learned a lot,  but I was still an outsider.",我坐在垃圾车上，沿着收垃圾的路线， 采访全纽约在办公室和工作现场 的环卫人员。 我学到了很多， 但我仍然是个局外人。
I needed to go deeper.,我需要更深入地了解。
So I took the job as a sanitation worker.,于是我真的找了份环卫工人的工作。
I didn't just ride in the trucks now. I drove the trucks.,现在我不仅仅是坐在垃圾车里，我开着垃圾车。
And I operated the mechanical brooms and I plowed the snow.,我自己操纵着电动扫帚扫大街、在路上铲雪。
It was a remarkable privilege  and an amazing education.,那可是一种非凡的特权， 也是令人叹服的受教育过程。
Everyone asks about the smell.,每个人都会问到垃圾臭味。
"It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you think,  and on days when it is really bad,  you get used to it rather quickly.",是有臭味，但它不是你想的那样糟糕。 有的时候气味确实很臭。 但你很快就会适应了。
The weight takes a long time to get used to.,垃圾的重量却需要很长时间来适应。
I knew people who were several years on the job  whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden  of bearing on your body  tons of trash every week.,我就知道即使有几年工作经验的熟练工， 他们的身体还试着在 适应每周 成吨的垃圾。
Then there's the danger.,那么这里面就存在着风险。
"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics,  sanitation work is one of the 10 most dangerous  occupations in the country,  and I learned why.",跟据劳动统计局的报告， 环卫工作是美国 十大最危险工种之一。 我后来慢慢明白了为什么。
"You're in and out of traffic all day,  and it's zooming around you.",你整天都在路上， 就身处车流之中。
"It just wants to get past you, so it's often  the motorist is not paying attention.",来往的车辆只想着超过你， 开车的人往往不够小心。
That's really bad for the worker.,对环卫工人来说，这实在太糟糕了。
And then the garbage itself is full of hazards  that often fly back out of the truck  and do terrible harm.,还有呢，垃圾本身就充满了毒害， 这些毒物经常会从垃圾车里飘出， 造成可怕的伤害。
I also learned about the relentlessness of trash.,我还了解到垃圾的残酷和可怕。
"When you step off the curb  and you see a city from behind a truck,  you come to understand that trash  is like a force of nature unto itself.",当你走下路沿， 在环卫车旁观察一个城市， 你会慢慢认识到垃圾 真的就像大自然本身的力量。
It never stops coming.,它从来都是源源而来的。
It's also like a form of respiration or circulation.,它也像呼吸或循环的一种形式。
It must always be in motion.,它总是在动态中。
And then there's the stigma.,最后一点，环卫工人被污名化。
"You put on the uniform, and you become invisible  until someone is upset with you for whatever reason  like you've blocked traffic with your truck,  or you're taking a break too close to their home,  or you're drinking coffee in their diner,  and they will come and scorn you,  and tell you that they don't want you anywhere near them.",当你穿上环卫制服，你被视而不见了。 直到有人找到什么理由难为你， 嫌你的环卫车阻碍交通呀， 嫌你在离他们家很近的地方休息呀， 嫌你在他们的小餐馆喝咖啡呀。 他们会走过来嘲笑你， 告诉你离他们远点。
"I find the stigma especially ironic,  because I strongly believe that sanitation workers  are the most important labor force  on the streets of the city, for three reasons.",我觉得这样的污名化非常地可笑， 因为我坚信环卫工人们 是城市街道上的 最重要的劳动力。 原因有三点。
They are the first guardians of public health.,他们是公共卫生的第一道屏障。
"If they're not taking away trash  efficiently and effectively every day,  it starts to spill out of its containments,  and the dangers inherent to it threaten us  in very real ways.",如果他们每天不 高效迅速地清理垃圾的话， 垃圾会从容器中泄露， 它本身的毒害会以一种非常真实的方式 威胁到我们的生活。
Diseases we've had in check for decades and centuries  burst forth again and start to harm us.,我们经过数个世纪和数十年攻克的疾病 会再次爆发，开始威胁我们的健康。
The economy needs them.,国民经济需要环卫工人。
"If we can't throw out the old stuff,  we have no room for the new stuff,  so then the engines of the economy  start to sputter when consumption is compromised.",如果我们不丢掉旧的东西， 我们就没有空间装新的东西。 那样的话，经济的引擎 就会停歇，因为人们的消费减少了。
"I'm not advocating capitalism, I'm just pointing out their relationship.",我不主张资本主义，我在这里只是指出它们的关系。
"And then there's what I call  our average, necessary quotidian velocity.",（第三个原因）就是我称之为 我们平均、 必要、经常性的活动速度。
By that I simply mean  how fast we're used to moving  in the contemporary day and age.,我的意思是说 在如今的年代和日子里，我们是如此地 习惯于奔忙。
"We usually don't care for, repair, clean, carry around  our coffee cup, our shopping bag,  our bottle of water.",我们通常不会在意、修理、 清洁、 随身携带 我们的咖啡杯，购物袋 和水瓶。
"We use them, we throw them out, we forget about them,  because we know there's a workforce  on the other side that's going to take it all away.",我们使用它们，然后扔掉它们，然后忘掉他们， 因为我们知道会有一支工作队伍 在一旁把这些东西清理掉。
So I want to suggest today a couple of ways  to think about sanitation that will perhaps help  ameliorate the stigma  and bring them into this conversation  of how to craft a city that is sustainable and humane.,所以今天我想建议大家去 想想环卫工人的处境， 也许能够帮助他们正名。 把他们请来参与谈论 如何建设一个可持续的人道的城市。
"Their work, I think, is kind of liturgical.",我认为他们的工作是很崇高的，
"They're on the streets every day, rhythmically.",他们每天按时地辛勤地在街上工作。
They wear a uniform in many cities.,在很多城市他们穿着环卫服不停工作。
You know when to expect them.,你知道他们会准时来清理垃圾。
And their work lets us do our work.,是他们使我们可以安心于自己的工作。
They are almost a form of reassurance.,他们几乎成了安心工作的保证。
"The flow that they maintain  keeps us safe from ourselves,  and that flow must be maintained always  no matter what.",他们所保持的工作流量 让我们自身安全无忧， 这样的工作流量不管怎样 都需要保持稳定性。
"On the day after September 11 in 2001,  I heard the growl of a sanitation truck on the street,  and I grabbed my infant son and I ran downstairs  and there was a man doing his paper recycling route  like he did every Wednesday.",2001年9月11日的第二天， 我听着街上环卫卡车咆哮而来， 我拉着年幼的儿子跑下楼。 有个回收报纸的工人 正在做他每周三都做的工作。
"And I tried to thank him for doing his work  on that day of all days,  but I started to cry.",我要感谢他做的这些工作 在那么特殊的日子里， 但我忍不住哭了起来。
"And he looked at me,  and he just nodded, and he said,  ""We're going to be okay.","他望着我， 只是点点头，然后说， ""我们会没事的。"
"We're going to be okay.""",我们会没事的。“
"It was a little while later that I started  my research with sanitation,  and I met that man again.",后来在我刚刚开始 研究环卫工作的时候， 我再次遇见了那个人。
"His name is Paulie, and we worked together many times,  and we became good friends.",他的名字叫保利，我们多次一起工作过， 还成为了好朋友。
I want to believe that Paulie was right.,我愿意相信保利的话是对的。
We are going to be okay.,我们会没事的。
"how we as a species exist on this planet,  we must include and take account of  all the costs, including the very real human cost  of the labor.",但我们作为这个星球的一份子， 我们需要努力地进行重建。 我们必须考虑到 所有的消耗，包括非常现实的劳动力 消耗。
"And we also would be well informed  to reach out to the people who do that work  and get their expertise  on how do we think about,  how do we create systems around sustainability  that perhaps take us from curbside recycling,  which is a remarkable success across 40 years,  across the United States and countries around the world,  and lift us up to a broader horizon  where we're looking at other forms of waste",而且我们需要更好地了解情况， 和各行业的 专家交流 我们自己的看法， 关于如何建立一个可持续发展体系的看法。 这或许把我们从街道垃圾回收， 这个成功地走过了40年历史， 跨越了美国在内的无数国家的工作， 引领到一个更大的范畴里。 我们可以考虑如何
that could be lessened  from manufacturing and industrial sources.,减少 来自制造业和其他工业来源的垃圾。
"Municipal waste, what we think of when we talk about garbage,  accounts for three percent of the nation's waste stream.",城市垃圾，我们通常认识中的垃圾 其实只占国内垃圾总量的3％。
It's a remarkable statistic.,这是个惊人的数据。
"So in the flow of your days,  in the flow of your lives,  next time you see someone whose job is  to clean up after you,  take a moment to acknowledge them.",所以在你的生活的每一天， 在你生命之河里， 下一次当你看到有人在 清理你留下的垃圾时， 请找个时间向他们致意，
Take a moment to say thank you.,找个时间说声谢谢。
My work focuses on the connection of  both thinking about our community life  being part of the environment  where architecture grows from the natural  local conditions and traditions.,"作为一名建筑设计师, 我在设计建筑的时候会同时考虑, 建筑与周围的自然环境,, 以及建筑与周围的人文环境, 即传统文化之间的关系."
Today I brought two recent projects  as an example of this.,"今天, 我将与大家分享两个 基于这种理念的案例."
"Both projects are in emerging countries,  one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.","这两个案例都位于新兴国家, 一个在埃塞俄比亚, 另一个在突尼斯."
And also they have in common  that the different analyses from different perspectives  becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.,"这两个案例的共同点之一, 在于设计方案的最终成型过程中, 从多个不同的角度 对建筑的分析, 构成了设计方案重要的组成部分."
The first example started with an invitation  in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.,第一个案例起源与我受到邀请 去为埃塞俄比亚首都亚的斯亚贝巴 设计一个新的多层购物广场.
"And this is the type of building  we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,  of what we had to design.","这就是当时我和我的团队 获得的一个样例, 我们被要求 设计成这种样子."
"At first, the first thing I thought was,  I want to run away.",我刚开始看到这个的感觉是 我真不想干了.
After seeing a few of these buildings --  there are many in the city --  we realized that they have three very big points.,在观察了类似这种风格的建筑之后-- 这个城市有很多这种风格的建筑-- 我们发现了这些建筑最重要的三个问题.
"First, these buildings, they are almost empty  because they have very large shops  where people cannot afford to buy things.","首先, 这些建筑基本上都是空的, 因为他们里面都是一些大的商铺, 当地人是买不起那些大品牌的."
"Second, they need tons of energy to perform  because of the skin treatment with glass  that creates heat in the inside,  and then you need a lot of cooling.","第二个问题, 它们需要大量的能源去调温度, 因为建筑外围铺的都是玻璃, 这种设计将热量困在建筑内部, 这导致我们需要很多制冷设备."
In a city where this shouldn't happen  because they have really mild weather  that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.,"这种情况不应该发生在这座城市, 因为这座城市的气候是相当宜人的, 全年温度稳定在20~25度左右."
And third is that their image has nothing to do  with Africa and with Ethiopia.,第三个问题就是这个建筑看起来跟非洲 或者埃塞俄比亚一点关系都没有.
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.,"对于一个文化底蕴如此丰富的城市, 这太叫人失望了."
"Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,  I was really captivated by the old merkato  that is this open-air structure  where thousands of people, they go and buy things  every day from small vendors.","同时, 在我第一次考察埃塞俄比亚的时候, 我被当地的集贸市场深深的迷住了. 每天, 成百上千的人 聚集在露天的建筑环境中, 从小商贩手里 买到各种想要的商品."
And also it has this idea of the public space  that uses the outdoors to create activity.,"这跟我的想法是一致的, 就是在室外 公共场合创造各种活动的想法."
"So I thought, this is what I really want to design,  not a shopping mall.","于是我想, 这才是我想要设计的, 忘掉购物中心吧."
"But the question was how we could do a multistory,  contemporary building with these principles.","但是问题是, 我们怎么才能在这样一个 当代多层建筑中贯彻这些理念呢?"
"The next challenge was when we looked at the site,  that is, in a really growing area of the city,  where most of these buildings that you see in the image,  they were not there.","第二个挑战就是当我们开始设计的时候, 这是一座快速发展的城市, 你们在照片上看到的很多建筑物, 在我们设计的时候 根本不存在."
And it's also between two parallel streets  that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.,"而且这座建筑前后靠着的两条平行街道, 在前后几百米都没有小路可以连通."
"So the first thing we did was to create a connection  between these two streets,  putting all the entrances of the building.","于是我们首先要做的就是 利用我们这座建筑物的 所有出入口, 将这两条路连起来."
And this extends with an inclined atrium  that creates an open-air space in the building  that self-protects itself with its own shape  from the sun and the rain.,"然后我们通过一个倾斜的中庭的设计, 创造了一个开放的建筑空间, 而且这种设计能够通过自身的形状避免下面的行人 受到日晒雨淋."
"And around this void  we placed this idea of the market with small shops,  that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.","围绕着这些空洞, 我们划分出很多的小商铺, 基于我们小集市的想法. 每层的商铺的布局都是随着空洞的形状不同而不同."
"I also thought, how to close the building?","我思考的另一个问题是, 建筑物的外墙如何装饰?"
And I really wanted to find a solution  that would respond to the local climate conditions.,"而且我真的希望能够找到一种装饰设计, 能够适合当地的气候条件."
"And I started thinking about the textile  like a shell made of concrete  with perforations that would let the air in,  and also the light, but in a filtered way.","我开始设想一种纹理结构, 用带有穿孔的水泥制成, 能够用一种受控的方式, 让外界的光线和空气能够进入建筑物中."
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.,我们从埃塞俄比亚妇女美丽的传统服装的图案上得到了灵感.
That they have fractal geometry properties  and this helped me to shape the whole facade.,"这些图案中包含了一些几何形状的 纹理片段, 我将类似的问题铺满了整个外墙."
And we are building that  with these small prefabricated pieces  that are the windows that let the air and the light  in a controlled way inside the building.,"我们铺外墙使用的 是这些小的预制材料, 这些窗户能够让空气和光线 按照我们控制的方式进入建筑物."
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses  that use the light from the inside of the building  to light up the building at night.,"为了实现这点, 我们使用这些小的有色玻璃, 利用建筑物内部的光源, 在夜间照亮整个建筑."
"With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers  because they were like,  ""This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.""","但是我们的这些想法一开始并没有打动建造者, 他们的反应类似于, ""这根本不是商场. 这不是我们想要的."""
But then we all realized that this idea of the market  happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall  because basically they had more shops to sell.,"但是随后我们都认识到, 这种设计方案 比传统的购物商场的方案更加的能赚钱, 因为这种设计方案能够出售的店铺数量更多."
"And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,  not only because of the material compared with the glass,  but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.","而且这种外墙的设计, 降低了很多很多的成本, 不仅仅是因为这种预制的材料比玻璃要便宜, 还因为我们不再需要使用那么多的空调来控制温度了."
So we created some budget savings  that we used to implement the project.,结果我们最终 还节约了一部分预算.
And the first implementation was to think  about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy  in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.,"构造阶段的第一个问题就是思考 如何保证大厦能够在电力上自给自足, 因为所在的城市几乎每天都要拉闸限电."
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.,于是我们在屋顶铺上了很多的太阳能电池板.
And then under those panels  we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars  that would create this urban oasis.,"接着我们想, 能不能在屋顶, 在这些太阳能电池板下面, 放置一些桌椅用来休息, 让这里成为城市中的绿洲, 供人们小憩."
"And these porches on the roof,  all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.","屋顶上的这些游廊, 被集中利用来收集雨水, 用于建筑内部的清洁."
"Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.","我们现在已经盖到第五层, 预计在明年初的时候完工."
"The second example is a master plan  of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.",第二个案例是为突尼斯城规划一个 超过2000套个公寓及附属设施的建筑.
"And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,  I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,  but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.","做这么大规模的项目, 这是我做过的最大的项目, 我不仅需要非常深刻的理解突尼斯这个城市, 还需要理解与她相关的种种传统以及文化."
"During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina  that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,  opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.","在分析的过程中我的注意力被一个阿拉伯人聚居区吸引, 这是一个有着一千多年历史的结构, 砖墙结构, 有12个门, 相互之间通过几乎是直线的道路相连."
"When I went to the site, the first design operation we did  was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks  similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona  and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.","当我开始在图纸上规划, 我们做的第一件事情 就是延长周边的街道, 将大区块分割12个基本的小区块 在大小和特征上都类似于我们在巴塞罗那 和其它欧洲城市常见的街区规划."
"On top of that, we selected some strategic points  reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,  and this modified this initial pattern.","在这些街区规划的基础上, 借鉴刚才提到的想法, 我们选择了一些关键点, 将这些关键点通过直线 连接起来, 改变了一开始的模式."
"And the last operation was to think about the cell,  the small cell of the project, like the apartment,  as an essential part of the master plan.","最后一步是考虑具体的区块内建筑的设计, 这些类似公寓的小隔间, 是构成这个巨大规划的基本组成部分."
"And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation  in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?","这个时候我在想, 对于一个位于地中海气候的公寓, 什么样的朝向是最好的?"
"And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house  and then a natural ventilation.","答案是南北朝向, 可以利用房子南北两侧的温度差异, 创造了一个自然的穿堂风效果."
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments  are perfectly oriented in that direction.,"于是我们实现了这种模式,让所有的公寓 都拥有完美的朝向."
And this is the result  that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.,"这是我们设计的效果, 像是一种结合, 阿拉伯城市风格与欧洲住宅风格的结合."
"It has these blocks with courtyards,  and then on the ground floor  you have all these connections for the pedestrians.","有些建筑区块是带有走庭院的, 而周围地面上的 人行道能够完整的连接起来."
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish  a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.,"同时她也满足的当地管理部门的需求, 上层建筑中的人口密度高, 地面人口密度不高."
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.,同时她也满足了我们对出入口之间连通性要求.
"The volume has this connecting shape  that shades itself with three different types of apartments  and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood  And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,  such as a gym and a kindergarten  and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.","这个建筑群的相互连接的形状, 通过三个不同类型的公寓建筑, 起到遮阳的作用. 同时, 让阳光能够透过密集的建筑穿透到地表. 在这些中庭之间, 包含了许多不同的设施, 像是健身馆, 幼儿园等, 以及一系列商业设备, 让公共区域充满活力."
"The roof, which is my favorite space of the project  is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.","屋顶是这个项目中我最得意的部分, 这就像是将被这些建筑物占用的空间重新还给了社区."
"And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,  and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,  jumping from one building to another.","社区的人们可以爬上屋顶, 相互打打招呼聊聊天, 或者做一些运动, 像是在早晨的时候在屋顶上 跑个两公里, 或是在建筑之间来回跳跃."
"These two examples,  they have a common approach in the design process.","这两个案例 有一些共同点, 在设计过程中采用了同样的方法."
"And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see  the cities literally growing.","同样, 他们都位于新兴城市, 你能直观的看到 建筑物一个个拔地而起."
"In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow  changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.","在这些城市, 建筑对于人们的影响, 无论当下还是未来 对当地社区及经济的影响, 跟建筑物建造的速度一样快."
"For this reason, I see even more importance  to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions  that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment  and that aim to connect nature and people.","出于这个原因, 我觉得对于建筑设计而言, 这个权衡越来越重要, 即, 寻找简单并且足够便宜的方案, 能够增强和促进当地的人们与城市环境的关系, 并且能够让人很好的接近自然."
Thank you very much.,非常感谢.

"He says, ""They are scientific investigations  with real intellectual value.""",他说：“这些是科学的调查， 有真正的知识价值。”

And I think there are three.,我想一共有这样三点。

The second is an aim: we should have more trust.,第二点是目的：我们应该有更多的信任感。

I don't have an overview.,我没法一概而论。
"But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,  and the opinion polls are supposedly  the source of a belief that trust has declined.",但当然了，我可以去看看民意调查， 民意调查应该是 觉得信任感在降低的出处。
"When you actually look at opinion polls across time,  there's not much evidence for that.",但当你真的去看看不同时间的民意调查的话， 其实没有多少证据支持这个观点。
"That's to say, the people who were mistrusted  20 years ago,  principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.",也就是说，那些 在20年前就不被相信的人 主要是记者和政客，现在仍不被信任。
"And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago  are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.",而20年前就被高度信任的人， 比如法官和护士，现在仍得到高度的信任。

"Do you trust elementary school teachers?""",你信任小学老师吗？
"you would probably begin by saying, ""To do what?""",你可能会问，“信任他们去做什么？”
And that would be a perfectly sensible response.,这是一个非常明智的反问。
"And you might say, when you understood the answer to that,  ""Well, I trust some of them, but not others.""","当你明白问题到底是什么, 你会说， “嗯。我相信一些人，不相信另一些人。”"
That's a perfectly rational thing.,非常理性的回答。
"In short, in our real lives,  we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.",简而言之，在我们现实生活中， 我们以不同的方式来寻求信任。
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust  that we will have in every instance of a certain type  of official or office-holder or type of person  is going to be uniform.,我们不对信任感的程度做假设。 我们会对特定类型进行具体分析。 那些公务员，官员之类的人， 会被类型化。
"I might, for example, say that I certainly trust  a certain elementary school teacher I know  to teach the reception class to read,  but in no way to drive the school minibus.",比如说，我会说我当然相信 一个我知道的小学老师 会教会学生怎么阅读。 但是我不相信她可以开校车。
"I might, after all, know that she wasn't a good driver.",也许最终我知道她确实不是个好司机。
I might trust my most loquacious friend  to keep a conversation going  but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret.,我也许相信我那爱喝酒的朋友 是个聊天的好伙伴。 但我不会相信他是个守得住秘密的人。
Simple.,就这么简单。
"So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives  of the way that trust is differentiated,  why do we sort of drop all that intelligence  when we think about trust more abstractly?",在日常生活中我们有了这样的证据， 说信任感是有区分的， 那么为什么民意调查时我们一下子糊涂了， 把信任感想得更概念化了呢？
"I think the polls are very bad guides  to the level of trust that actually exists,  because they try to obliterate the good judgment  that goes into placing trust.",我觉得民意调查是个很差劲的 衡量信任感是否存在的依据。 因为它抹杀了人们良好的判断力。 对考虑信任感的判断力。
"Secondly, what about the aim?",第二，那个目的是怎么回事儿呢？
The aim is to have more trust.,目的是我们需要更多的信任感。
"Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.",坦白说，我觉得这个目的挺可笑的。
It's not what I would aim at.,这不是我想的那个目的。
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy  but not in the untrustworthy.,我会说，人们应该对值得信赖的更加地信任。 而不是去信任不值得信赖的人。
"In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.",实际上，我所说的目的是尽量不要信任不值得信赖的人。
"And I think, of those people who, for example,  placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff,  who then made off with them,  and I think of them, and I think, well, yes,  too much trust.",比如说，那些 把自己的积蓄交给那个看起来很象样的 却把他们的钱都卷走的麦道夫先生 的人，我觉得那些人呀，怎么说呢，对， 太容易信任别人了。
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.,过度地信任别人不是一个很明智的目的。
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust  is the proper aim.,明智地信任和明智地选择不信任 才是正确的目的。
"Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,  that means that what matters in the first place  is not trust but trustworthiness.",那么有人说，好呀，好， 这不就是说最重要的 不是要去信任，而是信誉度吗？
It's judging how trustworthy people are  in particular respects.,就是说要判断别人在某些方面 是否值得信任。
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.,我觉得要想正确做出判断需要考虑三点。
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?,要看他们是否称职？是否诚实？是否可靠？
"And if we find that a person is competent  in the relevant matters,  and reliable and honest,  we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,  because they'll be trustworthy.",如果我们觉得一个人是称职的， 在他自己的领域是称职的。 而且是诚实可靠的。 我们就有理由去相信他们， 因为他们是可信赖的。
"But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.",但是反过来，如果他们不可靠，那我们就不能信任他们。
"I have friends who are competent and honest,  but I would not trust them to post a letter,  because they're forgetful.",我有一些诚实可靠的朋友， 但我就信不着他们去帮我寄信， 因为他们很健忘。
"I have friends who are very confident  they can do certain things,  but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.",我有些非常自信的朋友， 他们很能干， 但是我觉得他们有些过于自信。
"And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends  who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.",当然我很高兴的是，我的朋友都是 称职可靠，又不是非常不诚实的。
"If so, I haven't yet spotted it.",也许有，我还没发现。
But that's what we're looking for:  trustworthiness before trust.,我们需要的就是： 信任别人之前要看他的信誉度。
Trust is the response.,信任是我们的反应。
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge.,信誉度是需要我们来判断的。
"And, of course, it's difficult.",所以当然这不是容易做到的。
"Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct  systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions  and professionals and officials and so on  that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.",过去的几十年里，我们努力地建立 各种机构里的问责制度， 是否达到专业水准或者官方要求等等 这些使我们更容易判断是否有信誉。
A lot of these systems have the converse effect.,很多机构都有这样的逆反应。
They don't work as they're supposed to.,他们不象他们应该做的那样做事。
"I remember I was talking with a midwife who said,  ""Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer  to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby.""",我记得和我一个助产士聊天，她说 ”你看看，现在的问题是我要 办个什么手续比接生一个孩子还难！“
"And all over our public life, our institutional life,  we find that problem,  that the system of accountability  that is meant to secure trustworthiness  and evidence of trustworthiness  is actually doing the opposite.",在我们的公共生活里，我们的机构生活里， 我们发现很多问题。 这些机构里的问责制度 这些能保障自己的信誉 能作为值得信任的依据的制度 往往施行起来是相反的。
"It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,  like midwives, from doing them  by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.",这就使人们难以专注自己的工作， 比如助产士们， 让他们把时间浪费在填表上。就象我刚提到的。
You can all give your own examples there.,你们其实都有这样的经历。
So so much for the aim.,关于目的要讲的很多很多。
"The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,  and that is going to be different  if we are trying to be trustworthy  and communicate our trustworthiness to other people,  and if we are trying to judge whether other people  or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.",我想这个目的更重要的是对方的信誉度。 那就完全不一样了。 比如说我们努力去成为值得信任的人， 把我们值得信任的一面展示给别人。 比如说我们先判断别人， 官员或者政客是否值得信任。
"It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,  attitudes, don't do adequately here.",这不是容易的事。这是判断，是迅速反应， 是态度，在这里都讲不完。
"Now thirdly, the task.",那么第三点，关于任务。
"Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think,  also gets things backwards.",这个任务叫做重建信任感。 这又是弄反了的。
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.,这个任务建议你和我要重建信任。
"Well, we can do that for ourselves.",好吧，我们能对自己这么做，
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.,我们能重建一些自己的信誉，
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.,我们可以互相努力增加我们的信任。
"But trust, in the end, is distinctive  because it's given by other people.",但关根到底，信任是很独特的。 因为是来自他人的。
You can't rebuild what other people give you.,你不可能重建别人对你的看法。
You have to give them the basis  for giving you their trust.,你需要做出努力 让人家信任你。
"So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.",我是说，你要成为一个值得信赖的人。
"And that, of course, is because you can't fool  all of the people all of the time, usually.",当然，这就是说你不能 在永远愚弄住所有的人，一般来说。
But you also have to provide usable evidence  that you are trustworthy.,你得提供一些有用的依据， 让别人知道你是值得信赖的。
How to do it?,应该怎么做？
"Well every day, all over the place, it's being done  by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,  quite effectively.",其实每天，在不同得地方， 普通人，办公人员，各个机构都在努力， 往往做得很有效呢。
Let me give you a simple commercial example.,我给你举个简单的商家营销的例子，
"The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,  and they don't ask any questions.",有个商店说我可以把买的袜子退回去， 他们绝不问任何问题。
They take them back and give me the money  or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.,他们收退货，我拿退货款。 或者给我换是我喜欢颜色的袜子。
That's super. I trust them  because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.,这很好。我信任他们。 因为他们让我觉得他们是处于弱势。
I think there's a big lesson in that.,我觉得这很有教益。
"If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,  then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy  and you have confidence in what you are saying.",如果对于别人，你使自己处于弱势， 这就是个很好的值得信任的依据。 对自己说的话就有自信。
"So in the end, I think what we are aiming for  is not very difficult to discern.",所以最终呢，我们的意图 就不那么难辨别了。
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy  and can judge when and how the other person  is trustworthy.,人们是否值得信任是一种人和人之间的关系。 我们可以判断什么时候人们是如何 值得你信任的。
"So the moral of all this is,  we need to think much less about trust,  let alone about attitudes of trust  detected or mis-detected by opinion polls,  much more about being trustworthy,  and how you give people adequate, useful  and simple evidence that you're trustworthy.",从道义上说， 我们要少考虑信任， 更不要说对信任的态度， 或者凭着民意测验来判断或者误判， 让我们更关注于成为值得信赖的人。 关注于如何提供恰当、有益 简单的依据让人们觉得你是可以信赖的。
Thanks.,谢谢！
"Throughout the history of computers  we've been striving to shorten the gap between us  and digital information,  the gap between our physical world  and the world in the screen  where our imagination can go wild.",纵观计算机中的历史 我们一直在努力弥合 我们与数字信息之间的隔阂， 还有我们的现实世界 与虚拟世界之间的差距。 在虚拟世界里，我们的想象力是无穷的。

"Designers can materialize their ideas  directly in 3D,  and surgeons can practice on virtual organs  underneath the screen.",设计师们可以直接在三维立体空间内 实现他们的想法， 外科医生可以在屏幕里面 练习给虚拟器官动手术。
"So with this tool, this boundary has been broken.",可见，这个工具打破了虚拟和现实世界之间的边界。
But our two hands still remain outside the screen.,但我们双手还是在屏幕外。
How can you reach inside and interact  with the digital information  using the full dexterity of our hands?,我们怎样才能把手伸进去 和数字信息进行交互， 从而充分利用我们灵活的双手？

"By combining a transparent display and depth cameras  for sensing your fingers and face,  now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard  and reach inside this 3D space  and grab pixels with your bare hands.",通过将一个透明显示屏与几个深度摄像头结合， 这几个摄像头可以感知你的手指和脸， 现在你可以从键盘上抬起你的双手 伸进这个三维立体空间去 徒手控制里面的虚拟物质——像素点。
"Because windows and files have a position in the real space,  selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf.",因为窗口和文件在现实空间内有了具体位置， 选取它们变得像从书架上拿一本书那么容易。
Then you can flip through this book  on the virtual touch pad below each floating window.,然后你可以翻阅这本书 并在每个浮动窗口下面的虚拟触控板上 划出字词和句子。
Architects can stretch or rotate the models  with their two hands directly.,建筑师们可以直接用他们的双手 拉伸或旋转各种模型。

This is a view that you get from  head-mounted or see-through display  when the system understands the geometry of your body.,这是这个系统分析了我们身体的几何特征后， 通过头载式或透视式显示方式 展示给我们看的情形。
"Taking this idea further, I started to think,  instead of just seeing these pixels in our space,  how can we make it physical  so that we can touch and feel it?",不过，我又开始进一步思考这一想法， 怎样才能让我们空间里的这些可见的像素点 转变为实实在在 能摸得到、感觉到的物质？
What would such a future look like?,这种未来会是什么样子的？
"At MIT Media Lab, along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii  and my collaborator Rehmi Post,  we created this one physical pixel.",在麻省理工学院媒体实验室里，我和我的导师石井裕 还有我的搭档雷米·波斯特， 共同研制出这一“物质像素点”。
"Well, in this case, this spherical magnet  acts like a 3D pixel in our space,  which means that both computers and people  can move this object to anywhere  within this little 3D space.",在这种情况下，这个球形磁体 就好像是我们空间中的一个三维像素点， 这就意味着计算机和人 可以将这个物体移动到 这一三维立体小空间的任何位置。
What we did was essentially canceling gravity  and controlling the movement by combining  magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation  and sensing technologies.,我们的基本实现原理是，消除重力对小球的作用 并通过磁悬浮、机械驱动 和传感技术的结合 来控制小球的运动。
"And by digitally programming the object,  we are liberating the object from constraints  of time and space, which means that now,  human motions can be recorded and played back  and left permanently in the physical world.",通过对这个对象的数字编程， 我们正试着解放 时间和空间对物质的限制，这意味着，现在， 人的运动可以在物质世界中可以被 录制、重放和永久保留。
So choreography can be taught physically over distance  and Michael Jordan's famous shooting can be replicated  over and over as a physical reality.,这样，舞蹈编排就可以被远程而且真实地传授， 迈克尔·乔丹著名的扣篮动作就可以 反反复复、实实在在地被重演。
"Students can use this as a tool  to learn about the complex concepts  such as planetary motion, physics,  and unlike computer screens or textbooks,  this is a real, tangible experience  that you can touch and feel, and it's very powerful.",学生可以把它当作一种工具 去学习那些复杂的概念 比如行星运动、物理， 而且不同于电脑屏幕或教科书的是， 这种学习过程是真实存在的 你可以触摸它、感觉它，很给力！
And what's more exciting  than just turning what's currently in the computer physical  is to start imagining how programming the world  will alter even our daily physical activities.,更令人兴奋的是， 这不止是把当前计算机的东西转变为真实的物质， 而是开始想象，编程的世界甚至将 改变我们日常的体能活动。
"As you can see, the digital information  will not just show us something  but it will start directly acting upon us  as a part of our physical surroundings  without disconnecting ourselves from our world.",如您所见，数字信息 将不仅仅是把东西显示给我们 而是将开始直接作用于我们 成为我们现实环境的一部分 并非切断我们与现实世界的联系。
"Today, we started by talking about the boundary,  but if we remove this boundary,  the only boundary left is our imagination.",我今天的演讲是从谈论“边界”问题开始的， 如果我们能除去这一边界， 剩下的就是我们无边无际的想像力了。

"At 25, Emma came to my office  because she was, in her words, having an identity crisis.",25岁时，Emma来到我的办公室 因为她，用她的话来讲，正在经历一个身份危机。
"She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment,  but she hadn't decided yet,  so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead.",她说她认为她想从事艺术 或者娱乐，但她还没决定， 所以前几年她花在做服务员上了。

"And as hard as her 20s were,  her early life had been even harder.",而无论她的二十几岁有多么困难， 她以前的生活更困难。
"She often cried in our sessions,  but then would collect herself by saying, ""You can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.""",她在会面时经常哭， 但会说“你无法选择你的家庭，但是你能选择你的朋友。”
"Well one day, Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap,  and she sobbed for most of the hour.",然后平定下来。 有一天，Emma走进来， 把头放在膝盖上， 然后哭了近一个小时。
"She'd just bought a new address book,  and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts,  but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank  ""In case of emergency, please call ...""","她刚买了一个新的地址薄， 然后她花了一个上午填她的联系人， 但是她只能呆呆的看着 “在紧急情况下，请拨打..."""

"Now in that moment, it took everything I had  not to say, ""I will.""",当时，我花了很大力气 才避免说“我会”。
"But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really, really cared.",但Emma需要的并不是一位非常非常关心 她的治疗师。
"Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her chance.",Emma需要一个更好的生活，而且我知道这是她的机会。
I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex  to just sit there while Emma's defining decade  went parading by.,自从我在Alex身上下功夫后我学到了很多， 所以我不会让Emma那具有决定作用的十年 就这么流逝掉。
"So over the next weeks and months,  I told Emma three things  that every twentysomething, male or female,  deserves to hear.",所以在接下来的几周和几个月中， 我告诉了Emma 三个每个二十几岁的人，不论男女， 都应该听到东西。
"First, I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis  and get some identity capital.",首先，我告诉Emma忘了她的身份危机 然后开始积累身份资本。
"By ""get identity capital,""  I mean do something that adds value to who you are.",我所说的“积累身份资本”就是指 为你自己增加价值。

"So now is the time for that cross-country job,  that internship, that startup you want to try.",这是接受那份跨国职业， 那份实习和你想试试的那个起步的时候。
"I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here,  but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count,  which, by the way, is not exploration.",我不是在漠视二十几岁的人的探索， 但是我在漠视毫无意义的探索， 而且那些按道理来讲不能叫探索。

"Second, I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated.",其次，我告诉Emma城市部落被高估了。
"Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport,  but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers  limit who they know,  what they know, how they think,  how they speak, and where they work.",找好朋友来搭车至机场很棒， 但二十几岁的人若和思维方式 相似的同龄人聚在一起，他们所知道的人， 他们所知道的事，他们的思维方式，他们的讲话方式 以及他们的工作地点就会受到限制。
"That new piece of capital, that new person to date  almost always comes from outside the inner circle.",那个新的资本，那个新的可以约出去的人 几乎总是从内部圈子之外来的。
"New things come from what are called our weak ties,  our friends of friends of friends.",新的事物从我们所谓的微弱的联系中来， 比如我们的朋友的朋友的朋友。
"So yes, half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed.",是的，大概有一半的二十几岁的人未就业或者未充分就业。
"But half aren't,  and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group.",但有一半不是这样的，而微弱的联系 就是把你自己加入那一个团体的方式。
"Half of new jobs are never posted,  so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job.",有一半的新职位不会被张贴出来， 而联系到你的邻居的老板 就是你拿到那份未被张贴的工作的方法。

"Last but not least, Emma believed  that you can't pick your family, but you can pick your friends.",最后，Emma相信 一个人不能选择家庭，但可以选择朋友。
"Now this was true for her growing up,  but as a twentysomething, soon Emma would pick her family  when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own.",在她的成长过程中这是没错的， 但作为一个二十几岁的人，很快Emma就要通过 和某人结伴，创造一个家庭 来选择她自己的家庭。
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now.,我告诉Emma选择家庭的时间就是现在。

But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with  when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle  is not progress.,但当你在别的人开始进入结婚礼堂时 抓紧和你同居或睡觉的人 不叫进步。
"The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one,  and that means being as intentional with love  as you are with work.",在婚事上下功夫的最好时间 就是结婚之前， 意思就是对待爱情就要像对待工作一样 富有意识。
Picking your family is about consciously choosing  who and what you want  rather than just making it work or killing time  with whoever happens to be choosing you.,选择家庭就是有意识的选择 你想要的人和物 而不是单单想让事情成功或者和 选择你的那个人浪费时间。
So what happened to Emma?,那Emma后来怎么样了？

"When I was 27 years old,  I left a very demanding job in management consulting  for a job that was even more demanding: teaching.",在我27岁的时候， 我辞去了一份非常有挑战性的职业—企业管理咨询， 转而投入了一份更加具有挑战性的职业：教育。

"But these concepts are not impossible,  and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students  could learn the material  if they worked hard and long enough.",但是这些概念是完全可以被掌握的， 我坚信我的每一位学生 都可以学会教材内容， 只要他们肯花时间和精力的话。
"After several more years of teaching,  I came to the conclusion that what we need in education  is a much better understanding of students and learning  from a motivational perspective,  from a psychological perspective.",经过几年教学之后， 我得出一个结论，我们在教育方面所需要的是 从学习动力的角度和心理学的角度， 对学生和学习行为 进行一次更为深刻的理解。

But what if doing well in school and in life  depends on much more  than your ability to learn quickly and easily?,就是IQ， 但如果在学校和生活中的优秀表现 远不仅仅依赖于 你轻松高效学习的能力呢？

It was grit.,它是毅力。
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals.,毅力是对长远目标的激情和坚持，
Grit is having stamina.,毅力是拥有持久的恒劲，
"Grit is sticking with your future, day in, day out,  not just for the week, not just for the month,  but for years,  and working really hard to make that future a reality.",毅力是你对未来的坚持，日复一日 不是仅仅持续一个星期或者一个月， 而是几年甚至几十年努力奋斗着 让自己的梦想变为现实。

"A few years ago,  I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools.",几年前，在芝加哥的公立学校里， 我开始研究毅力。
"I asked thousands of high school juniors  to take grit questionnaires,  and then waited around more than a year  to see who would graduate.",我对上千名初中生进行了 关于毅力的问卷调查， 然后等候了一年多， 来看最终哪些学生能毕业。

"So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee  that grit matters. It's also in school,  especially for kids at risk for dropping out.",所有不仅仅是在西点军校里或者全国拼字比赛上 才需要毅力。在学校亦是如此， 尤其是对于那些徘徊在辍学边缘的孩子们。
"To me, the most shocking thing about grit  is how little we know,  how little science knows, about building it.",对于我自己来说，关于毅力最让我震惊的事情莫过于 对于毅力，我们知之甚少， 在培养毅力上，科学对理解的认识又是何等贫乏。

What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic?,该做些什么才能教授给孩子们真正的职业道德？

"The honest answer is, I don't know.   What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty.",老实说，我不知道。 我所知道的是，才华并不能使你坚韧不拔。
Our data show very clearly  that there are many talented individuals  who simply do not follow through on their commitments.,我们的数据十分清楚地表明， 有许多才华横溢的人， 他们都无法坚持兑现自己的承诺。
"In fact, in our data, grit is usually unrelated  or even inversely related to measures of talent.",事实上，根据我们的数据来看，毅力通常与其他因素无关， 甚至与才华的衡量标准背道而驰。
"So far, the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids  is something called ""growth mindset.""",到目前为止，我所听说过的在孩子身上培养坚韧品质最有效的方法 叫“成长型思维模式。”
"This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck,  and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed,  that it can change with your effort.",斯坦福大学卡洛杜威克提出过一个观点， 他相信 人的学习能力是可变的， 它随着你的努力程度而变化。
"Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain  and how it changes and grows in response to challenge,  they're much more likely to persevere when they fail,  because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.",杜威克教授表示，当孩子们阅读和学习有关大脑的知识 以及它在面对挑战时 所发生的变化和成长情况， 他们失败之后更容易坚持下去， 因为他们 不相信会一直失败下去。
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit.,因此，成长性思维模式对培养毅力大有裨益。
But we need more.,但是我们需要更多。
"And that's where I'm going to end my remarks,  because that's where we are.",我决定在此结束我的评论， 因为我们正在经历着这一切。
That's the work that stands before us.,这是眼前所面临的工作。

I think there was a first-kiss moment  when I really expected the credits to start rolling  because that's the end of the movie, right?","就我自己的经验而言, 从莱娅公主所处环境中得到的经验 不足以指导我在现实生活中引导孩子进入成人世界 成人世界是＂男女混居的＂。 我认为荧幕上的初吻 应该发生在电影的最后，最好是演员表出现的时候, 因为这是电影的结局，对么？"

"For trying to map the past, I knew that I had to see differently.",为了画出过去的地图，我必须从另一个角度去观察。
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently  using the infrared.,让我来给你们一个例子，如何运用红外线 来从另一个角度观察。
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta  called Mendes.,这个遗址坐落在埃及三角洲东部， 名叫班迪克斯。
"And the site visibly appears brown,  but when we use the infrared  and we process it, all of the sudden, using false color,  the site appears as bright pink.",从肉眼看来，遗址看起来是褐色的。 但当我们用红外线时， 经过假色处理，忽然间， 遗址反映出亮粉色。

"What I want to share with you today  is how we've used satellite data  to find an ancient Egyptian city,  called Itjtawy, missing for thousands of years.",我今天想和你们分享的是 我们是如何用卫星数据 来找到一座已经失踪了数千年之久的 埃及古城： “伊其塔维”。
"Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital  for over four hundred years,  at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom,  about four thousand years ago.",伊其塔维曾经是古埃及的首都， 历时400年， 当时古埃及处于中王国时期， 大约4000年前。
"The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt,  and the site is really important, because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance  for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.",遗址坐落在如今埃及的法尤姆。 这座遗址非常珍贵，因为在中王国时期 是一个古埃及艺术，建筑，宗教的复兴时期
"Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy  was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it,  indicated within the red circles here,  but somewhere within this massive flood plain.",埃及学家很早就知道伊其塔维的大概位置， 在两位开城国王的金字塔附近， 也就是用红圈的区域， 在这片广阔的泛洪区的某处。
This area is huge --  it's four miles by three miles in size.,这篇区域非常广阔， 四公里长，三公里宽。
"The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy,  and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east,  it covered over the city.",尼罗河曾经在“伊其塔维”古城周围流过 随着河道变化，河流渐渐的向东移动 最终覆盖了这座城市。
"So, how do you find a buried city  in a vast landscape?",所以，如何在那么大的范围里 寻找一座被埋没的城市？
"Finding it randomly would be the equivalent  of locating a needle in a haystack,  blindfolded, wearing baseball mitts.",随機的去尋找这座城市 就好像在海底捞针的同时， 还蒙着眼，带着棒球手套。
"So what we did is we used NASA topography data  to map out the landscape, very subtle changes.",所以，我们用NASA的地形数据 来精确的画出地形图。
We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow.,然后看出尼罗河过去流经哪里。
"But you can see in more detail, and even more interesting,  this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here  which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy.",但你可以看到更多细节——更有意思的是 这一小片略微隆起的区域 就在这个圈内，是我们认为伊其塔维古城可能的位置
"So we collaborated with Egyptian scientists  to do coring work, which you see here.",所以我们和埃及的科学家合作 一起完成了取芯的工作，也就是你现在看到的
"When I say coring, it's like ice coring,  but instead of layers of climate change, you're looking for layers of human occupation.",我指的取芯工作，有点象是冰层取芯， 但我们寻找的是有人类的痕迹的地层，而不是气候变化的痕迹。
"And, five meters down,  underneath a thick layer of mud,  we found a dense layer of pottery.",5米朝下， 在一层厚厚的泥浆下， 我们发现了包含大量陶器的地层。
"What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy,  five meters down,  we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years,  dating to the Middle Kingdom, dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is.",这说明，在这个可能的位置 5米朝下 是一层有几百年历史的地层， 其历史可以追溯到中王国时期，正好是我们认为伊其塔维存在的时期。
"We also found work stone --  carnelian, quartz and agate  that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here.",我们还找到了石料—— 各种玛瑙，水晶，显示出 这里曾经有一个珠宝作坊。
"These might not look like much,  but when you think about the most common stones  used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,  these are the stones that were used.",这些可能看起来很普通， 但比较一下中王国时期 珠宝最常用的石料， 这就是那些最常见的石料。
"So, we have a dense layer of occupation  dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.",所以我们在这里找到了一层人类居住过的痕迹， 一直追溯到中王国时期。
"We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop,  showing that whatever was there was a very important city.",我们同样有一座名贵珠宝作坊的证据， 显示不论如何，这是一座非常重要的城市。
"No Itjtawy was here yet,  but we're going to be returning to the site  in the near future to map it out.",这里还不一定是伊其塔维， 但我们在不遠的未來就会回到这片遗址 去进行绘图。
"And even more importantly,  we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology  so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.",更重要的是， 我们筹资训练年轻的埃及人 使用卫星技术， 这样他们自己也能够做出这些重要发现了。
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom --  it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago.,所以我想用中王国时期，我最喜欢的引述 来作为结尾—— 这句话很可能在4000年前，在伊其塔维写下的
"""Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings.",“分享知识是最伟大的使命。
"There's nothing like it in the land.""",世间没有其他事可以相提并论。”
"So as it turns out, TED was not founded in 1984 AD.",结果你发觉，TED并不是公元1984年建立的。
"Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC  at a not-lost-for-long city, found from above.",这个想法其实是从公元前1984年， 从一座“失落了没多久”，又这样被找到的古城开始的。

I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in New York City.,我要给你们讲一个每年春天在纽约
It's called the United States Memory Championship.,都会举办的奇异竞赛 叫做全美记忆冠军赛
"And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back as a science journalist,  expecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants.","几年前我作为一名科技类记者 去报道这项竞赛 心里想着 大概那儿得像 怪才的""超级碗冠军赛""一样热闹吧"
"This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,  widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep.",一大堆男人和屈指可数的女性 从小孩儿到老人 有些还不怎么注意个人卫生
"They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers,  They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers.",有的奋力在只看一次的情况下 记下上百个任意列出的数字 有的在努力记住成群的陌生人的名字

And I started talking to a few of the competitors.,所以我开始采访参赛者
"This is a guy called Ed Cook, who had come over from England,  where he had one of the best-trained memories.",这位叫Ed Cook 是从英格兰来的 他在那儿接受了最好的记忆训练

"In fact, I have just an average memory.",其实 我的记忆力很一般
Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you  that they have just an average memory.,来参赛的每一个人 都会告诉你他们的记忆力只是一般水平
"We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory  using a set of ancient techniques,  techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece,  the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches,  that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books.""","我们都在训练自己后才能 完成这些奇迹般的记忆游戏 我们运用了一系列古老的技巧 这些技巧是希腊人在两千五百年前发明的 西塞罗正是用了这些技巧 来记忆他的演讲稿的 中世纪学者用这种技巧来背诵正本书籍的内容"""
"And I said, ""Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?""","我惊讶不已 ""哇噻 怎么我从来没听说过呢?"""
"And we were standing outside the competition hall,  and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy,  says to me, ""Josh, you're an American journalist.","我们站在竞技大厅外 聪明过人 令人惊叹 而又稍有些古怪的英国人Ed 对我说 ""Josh 你是个美国记者"

"I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?""","总得找个人开教嘛 不是吗?"""
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.,接着 一段非常奇特的历程在我面前展开了序幕
"I ended up spending the better part of the next year  not only training my memory,  but also investigating it,  trying to understand how it works,  why it sometimes doesn't work,  and what its potential might be.",结果 第二年的大部分时间 我都花在了训练自己的记忆力 同时调查研究记忆上 我想尝试理解产生记忆的原理 为何有时会记了又忘 及其它到底隐藏着什么样的潜力
And I met a host of really interesting people.,途中我遇到了很多有趣的人
This is a guy called E.P.,其中一个叫E.P.
"He's an amnesic who had, very possibly,  the worst memory in the world.",他患有健忘症 他的记忆力 恐怕是世界上最差的了
"His memory was so bad,  that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem,  which is amazing.",他的记忆能力差到 甚至记不得自己有健忘症 真的很神奇
"And he was this incredibly tragic figure,  but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are.",虽然他是个悲剧角色 但通过他 我们能了解到 记忆在何种程度上塑造了我们的人格
"At the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.",情况的另一个极端是 我遇到了这样一个人
"This is Kim Peek, he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character  in the movie ""Rain Man.""",他叫Kim Peek 他是Dustin Hoffman在电影《雨人》里的角色的原型
We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library  which was scintillating.,我和他花了一下午 在盐湖城公共图书馆里背电话簿 让我大开眼界
"And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises,  treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin,  in antiquity, and then later, in the Middle Ages.",回家后 我读了许多关于记忆的论文 写于两千多年前的论文 用拉丁文写的 从古代 一直到后来中世纪期间
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.,我学到很多很有意思的事儿
"One of the really interesting things that I learned  is that once upon a time,  this idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory  was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.",其中一个就是 曾经 训练 规束 培养记忆力的这种概念 完全不像如今那样陌生
"Once upon a time, people invested in their memories,  in laboriously furnishing their minds.",曾几何时 人们寄希望于自己的记忆 能不遗余力地装饰自己的心灵
"Over the last few millenia,  we've invented a series of technologies --  from the alphabet, to the scroll,  to the codex, the printing press, photography,  the computer, the smartphone --  that have made it progressively easier and easier  for us to externalize our memories,  for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity.",近几千年来 人类发明了一系列技术 从字母表到卷轴 到法典 印刷机 摄影技术 电脑 智能手机 让我们能越来越轻松地 外化记忆能力 让我们从根本上 把这种基础的人类能力拱手让出
"These technologies have made our modern world possible,  but they've also changed us.",这些技术让现代生活变为可能 但同时也改变了我们
"They've changed us culturally,  and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively.",不仅在文化上 我觉得也在认知上
"Having little need to remember anymore,  it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how.",不再需要费劲去记忆 有时会觉得我们已经忘了如何去记忆
"One of the last places on Earth where you still find  people passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,  is at this totally singular memory contest.",在这片地球上已经很少有地方 能让你觉得人们仍热衷于 训练 规束 培养记忆力了 那非同寻常的记忆大赛算是一个
"It's actually not that singular,  there are contests held all over the world.",其实它也没有那么非同寻常 世界各地都开始举办这样的竞赛
"And I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.",我对此深深着迷 想要知道这些人是怎么做到的
A few years back a group of researchers at University College London  brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab.,几年前 伦敦大学学院的一组研究人员 请来一批记忆大赛的冠军接受研究
"They wanted to know:  Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally,  anatomically different from the rest of ours?",他们想要弄明白 这些人的大脑 是否跟我们其他人在解剖学上的结构不一样?
The answer was no.,答案是否定的
Are they smarter than the rest of us?,那他们比我们都聪明吗?
"They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was: not really.",他们给研究对象实施了一系列认知测试 依旧得出了否定结论
"There was, however, one really interesting and telling difference  between the brains of the memory champions  and the control subjects that they were comparing them to.",但对比受控制的比对目标的大脑 记忆大赛冠军们的大脑 确实有一处很有趣的不同 很说明问题
"When they put these guys in an fMRI machine,  scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers  and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes,  they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain  than everyone else.",这些人被送去做功能磁共振 扫描大脑时 当他们在记忆数字或人脸或雪花图案时 研究人员发现记忆大赛冠军们 的大脑激活的区域 跟普通人不太一样
"Of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using,  a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation.",值得注意的是 他们看来是在用 脑中在空间记忆和导航时会用到的部分
Why? And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this?,为什么? 我们可以从中得出什么样的结论呢?
"The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where,  every year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly,  and then the rest of the field has to play catch-up.",竞争性记忆的较量 被一种类似军事比赛的方式推向了白热化 每年都会有人 带着更有效的记忆方法现身赛场 而其他人就必须迎头赶上
"This is my friend Ben Pridmore,  three-time world memory champion.",这是我的朋友Ben Pridmore 赢得过三次国际记忆大赛冠军
"On his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards  that he is about to try to memorize in one hour,  using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered.",在他的台前 有三十六副打乱顺序的牌 他要在一个小时内记下全部 用的是一种他自己发明的 也只有他会的技巧
"He used a similar technique  to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits  in half an hour.",用与此类似的方法 他曾一字不差地背下了 4140个任意排列的二进制数 只用了半个小时
Yeah.,很牛吧
"And while there are a whole host of ways  of remembering stuff in these competitions,  everything, all of the techniques that are being used,  ultimately come down to a concept  that psychologists refer to as ""elaborative encoding.""","参赛者在这些竞赛中 运用过很多不同的记忆方法 各式各样 被运用到的所有技巧 最终都能归化为一个概念 心理学家称之为""精细编码"""
"And it's well-illustrated by a nifty paradox  known as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this:  If I tell two people to remember the same word,  if I say to you,  ""Remember that there is a guy named Baker.""","这个概念能用一则幽默的悖论完美诠释 叫做Baker/baker悖论 简单说来就是 假设我让两个人去记同一个词 我跟你说 ""记住有个人叫Baker"""
That's his name.,Baker是人名
"And I say to you, ""Remember that there is a guy who is a baker.""","我又来告诉你 ""记住有个人是面包师"""
"And I come back to you at some point later on,  and I say, ""Do you remember that word that I told you a while back?","过了一段时间我又回来找到你们 问 ""还记得我之前 叫你们记住的那个词吗?"""
"Do you remember what it was?""",”还记得是什么词吗?“
The person who was told his name is Baker  is less likely to remember the same word  than the person was told his job is a baker.,被告知人名是Baker的人 记住这个词的可能性远不如 被告知职业是面包师的那个人
"Same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird.",同样的词 导致不同的记忆程度
What's going on here?,到底是为什么呢
"Well, the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.",是因为 人名Baker没有任何特殊含义 没法跟你脑海里
It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories  floating around in your skull.,零碎繁杂的记忆产生任何联系 但是面包师作为一个常用名词
"But the common noun ""baker"" -- we know bakers.",我们都知道面包师是什么
Bakers wear funny white hats.,面包师带着搞笑的白帽子
Bakers have flour on their hands.,他们手上沾满了面粉
Bakers smell good when they come home from work.,他们下班回到家带着扑鼻的烤面包香
Maybe we even know a baker.,甚至可能有些人有朋友就是面包师
"And when we first hear that word,  we start putting these associational hooks into it,  that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.",我们初次听到这个词时 马上就会产生各种各样的联想 这使我们能在一段时间后还能回忆起来
"The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests,  and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life,  is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers  into lower-case B bakers --  to take information that is lacking in context,  in significance, in meaning,  and transform it in some way,  so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things  that you have in your mind.",其实 要理解记忆竞赛中的 一切奥妙 或在日常生活中改善记忆力的秘诀 仅仅在于想办法把Baker中的大写B 变为面包师中的小写b 把没有前因后果 没有重要性 没有涵义的信息 用某种方法转化为 有意义的内容 跟脑海里的其他记忆串联起来
"One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this  dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.",这种精确记忆的技巧 在两千五百年前的古希腊就已出现
It came to be known as the memory palace.,后来将其称为记忆宫殿
"The story behind its creation goes like this:  There was a poet called Simonides, who was attending a banquet.",发明这种技巧的过程如下 有个叫做Simonides的诗人 他要去参加一个晚宴
"He was actually the hired entertainment,  because back then, if you wanted to throw a really slamming party,  you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.",其实他算是被请去做表演嘉宾的 因为在那个年代 炫酷派对的标准 不是请D.J.来打碟 而是要请诗人来颂诗
"And he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door,  and at the moment he does,  the banquet hall collapses. Kills everybody inside.",他站起来 背出了他的全篇诗作 然后潇洒离去 他刚走出门口 晚宴大厅就塌了 砸死了里面所有的人
"It doesn't just kill everybody,  it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition.",不仅全体死亡 所有的死者都被砸得面目全非
"Nobody can say who was inside,  nobody can say where they were sitting.",没人说得清死者都有些谁 没人说得清谁坐在哪儿
The bodies can't be properly buried.,导致死者的尸体没法得到合适的殉葬安置
It's one tragedy compounding another.,这又加重了整件事的悲剧色彩
"Simonides, standing outside,  the sole survivor amid the wreckage,  closes his eyes and has this realization,  which is that in his mind's eye,  he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting.",Simonides站在外面 作为废墟中的唯一幸存者 闭上眼睛 猛然意识到 在他的脑海中 他眼前出现了所有宾客所坐的位置
"And he takes the relatives by the hand,  and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage.",他就牵着亲属们的手 穿过废墟 把他们带到了亲人身边
"What Simonides figured out at that moment,  is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know,  which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers,  and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues,  we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.",Simonides当时猛然醒悟的事 大概我们大家也都猜到了 其实是 不管我们 有多不善于记住姓名 电话号码 或是同事的每句指令 我们都拥有异常敏锐的视觉或空间记忆能力
"If I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story  that I just told you about Simonides,  chances are you would have a tough time with it.",要是我让你们逐字逐句地重述 我刚才讲的Simonides故事的前十个字 应该没几个人会记得
"But, I would wager that if I asked you to recall  who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse  in your foyer right now,  you would be able to see that.",但我敢打赌 如果我让你们现在回想下 在你的门厅里 坐在会讲话的棕色骏马上的 是谁 你们就明白我刚才说的意思了
"The idea behind the memory palace  is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye,  and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember --  the crazier, weirder, more bizarre,  funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,  the more unforgettable it's likely to be.",记忆宫殿的原理 就是在你的脑海里建立一栋想象大厦 并让你想记住的东西 的影像充满其中 越是疯狂 古怪 奇诡 荒诞搞笑 乱七八糟 招人厌恶的影像 就越容易记住
"This is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years  to the earliest Latin memory treatises.",这个建议来自于两千多年前 拉丁最早的记忆学者
So how does this work?,那么 这种说法的原理到底是什么呢
"Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech,  and you want to do it from memory,  and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it,  if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.",假设你被邀请 站上TED的中心讲台演讲 而你想脱稿完成 如西塞罗在两千年前在TEDx罗马上的演讲一般 他就会这么霸气走一回 而你也想这样
What you might do  is picture yourself at the front door of your house.,你要做的就是 想象自己站在自家门前
"And you'd come up with some sort of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,  to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about  is this totally bizarre contest.",然后凭空想象出 一段完全荒诞疯狂难忘的景象 用来提示你上台要提的第一件事 就是这场诡异的裸骑大赛
"And then you'd go inside your house,  and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.",然后你走进房子里 想到甜饼怪物 坐在Ed先生背上的样子
And that would remind you  that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook.,这个景象会提醒你 要介绍你的朋友Ed Cook
And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears  to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell.,然后你脑海里出现了小甜甜布兰妮的样子 你就会想起要讲那个关于布兰妮的小故事
"And you'd go into your kitchen,  and the fourth topic you were going to talk about  was this strange journey that you went on for a year,  and you'd have some friends to help you remember that.",然后你走进厨房 你要说到的第四个话题是 你花了一整年走过的奇妙历程 通过绿野仙踪就可以联想得到
"This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches --  not word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up,  but topic-for-topic.",这就是罗马演说家背诵演讲稿的秘诀 并非一字不差 逐字背诵只会平添麻烦 而是记住一个个主题
"In fact, the phrase ""topic sentence"" --  that comes from the Greek word ""topos,""  which means ""place.""","其实 短语""主题句"" 就来源于希腊词""topos"" 意思是""地点"""
That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric  in these sorts of spatial terms.,这是古时候 人们谈到演讲或是修辞时 会用到的空间术语
"The phrase ""in the first place,""  that's like ""in the first place of your memory palace.""","短语 ""第一"" 就意味着你的记忆宫殿的第一层"
"I thought this was just fascinating,  and I got really into it.",这简直太有意思了 我对这起了很大的兴趣
"And I went to a few more of these memory contests,  and I had this notion that I might write something longer  about this subculture of competitive memorizers.",后来我又去了更多记忆大赛 我开始萌发了要更详细描写 这种竞技记忆文化的念头
But there was a problem.,但有一个问题
The problem was that a memory contest  is a pathologically boring event.,问题是记忆大赛 其实过程很无聊的
"Truly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs --  I mean, the most dramatic it gets  is when somebody starts massaging their temples.",真的 就像一群人坐那儿高考一样 最最激动人心的时刻 也不过就是有人揉了揉太阳穴
"And I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.",我是个记者 总得有东西可写呀
"I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds,  but I don't have access to it.",我知道这些人脑子里肯定是惊涛骇浪 但我作为外人无法得见
"And I realized, if I was going to tell this story,  I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.",我意识到 若我真的想报道这事儿 一定得亲身体验才行
"And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sat down with my New York Times,  just trying to remember something.",所以我开始尝试着每天早上坐下来看纽约时报前 花上十五到二十分钟 尝试记忆一些事
"Maybe it was a poem,  maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market.",背背小诗 背背我在跳蚤市场买来的 旧年鉴里的人名
And I found that this was shockingly fun.,我惊奇地发现这其实非常带劲
I never would have expected that.,要不去尝试根本想不到
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.,有趣在于 其实目标并不是要通过训练提高记忆力
"What you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better  at creating, at dreaming up,  these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious,  and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye.",而是你在努力培养改善 创造力 想象力 在你的脑海里凭空造出 那些完全滑稽荒诞胡乱 最好是难忘的影像
And I got pretty into it.,而它成为了我的乐趣
This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit.,这是我戴着标准竞赛记忆者训练套装的样子
"It's a pair of earmuffs  and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over  except for two small pinholes,  because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy.",它有一对耳塞 一副护目镜 镜面全部遮黑 就留了两个小孔 因为竞技记忆者最大的敌人就是注意力分散
"I ended up coming back to that same contest  that I had covered a year earlier,  sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism.",最后 我再次回到了一年前报道的那场竞赛场上 我一时冲动 也想报名参加 就当做参与性新闻报道的实验了
"It'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research.",我当时想 到时能在前言里调侃一下自己也好
"Problem was, the experiment went haywire.",问题是 实验最后得到了意想不到的结果
I won the contest --  which really wasn't supposed to happen.,那场竞赛我赢了 真是完全出乎我预料之外
"Now, it is nice to be able to memorize speeches  and phone numbers and shopping lists,  but it's actually kind of beside the point.",对我来说现在 背演讲稿 电话号码 或是购物单 都是小菜一碟 倒是很不错 但其实这些都不重要了
These are just tricks.,这些都是小伎俩
They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles  about how our brains work.,这些记忆伎俩之所以有效 是因为它们依仗人类大脑运转的 一些基本原理
And you don't have to be building memory palaces  or memorizing packs of playing cards  to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.,并不用真的去建立记忆宫殿 或记下几副牌的顺序 你也完全可以从了解大脑运转原理中 获得一些益处
"We often talk about people with great memories  as though it were some sort of an innate gift,  but that is not the case.",我们总会议论记忆力很好的人 总觉得那些人是天赋异禀 事实并不是这样
Great memories are learned.,强大的记忆力是可以习得的
"At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.",从最根本的说起 专心致志就能记住
We remember when we are deeply engaged.,全心投入时就能记住
"We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience,  and figure out why it is meaningful to us,  why it is significant, why it's colorful,  when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense  in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds,  when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers.",只要能想办法把信息和经历 转化为有意义的事 就能记住 想它为何重要 为何多彩 当我们能把它转化成为 有前因后果的事 并跟我们脑海中繁杂琐碎的其他事产生联想时 当我们能把人名Baker转化为面包师baker时
"The memory palace, these memory techniques --  they're just shortcuts.",记忆宫殿 或是那些记忆技巧 都只是捷径而已
"In fact, they're not even really shortcuts.",其实 说到底它们都不能算捷径
They work because they make you work.,这方法有效是因为它迫使你思考
"They force a kind of depth of processing,  a kind of mindfulness,  that most of us don't normally walk around exercising.",它迫使你往更深层次去想 让你更加专注 大部分人平时并不会费力去训练这个
But there actually are no shortcuts.,其实捷径并不存在
This is how stuff is made memorable.,这一直就是我们能记住事物的原因
"And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with,  it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem,  left me with,  which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories.",有一件事我希望你们能记住 就是E.P. 那个连自己患了健忘症都想不起来的人 让我深思 得出了一个感想 人生就是我们个人记忆的合集
"from our already short lives,  by losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones,  by not paying attention to the human being across from us  who is talking with us,  by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply?",在短暂的人生里 你还愿意因为黑莓 iPhone 丧失多少瞬间 忽略对面坐着的人 在跟我们交谈的人 变得越发懒惰 不愿意
I learned firsthand  that there are incredible memory capacities  latent in all of us.,深究任何事？ 通过亲身经历 我发现 我们的身体里潜藏着
"But if you want to live a memorable life,  you have to be the kind of person  who remembers to remember.",不可思议的记忆能力 但若你想活得难忘 就得做那种 记得时常记忆的人
Thank you.,谢谢
Today I'm going to speak to you  about the last 30 years of architectural history.,今天我要跟大家讲述 过去30年的建筑史。
That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.,太多东西要在这18分钟内讲述了。
"It's a complex topic,  so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place:  New Jersey.",这是一个复杂的题目， 那就让我们从这个复杂的地方开始： 新泽西。
"Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,  and I was six, and I lived there in my parents' house  in a town called Livingston,  and this was my childhood bedroom.",三十年前，我住新泽西 那时我六岁，我住在父母家 小镇名叫Livingston， 这是我儿时的卧室。
Around the corner from my bedroom  was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister.,在我卧室的角落 是我和姐姐共用的洗手间。
And in between my bedroom and the bathroom  was a balcony that overlooked the family room.,在我的卧室和浴室之间 是一个可以看到客厅的阳台。
"And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV,  so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom,  everyone would see me,  and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel,  everyone would see me.",那是家人聚会，看电视的客厅， 每次我从卧室走去浴室的时候， 每个人都能看到我， 每次我洗完澡 裹着浴巾走回卧室， 每个人都能看到我，
And I looked like this.,我看起来是这样。
"I was awkward,  insecure, and I hated it.",我很尴尬， 没有安全感，我讨厌我的房间。
"I hated that walk, I hated that balcony,  I hated that room, and I hated that house.",我讨厌那段路，我讨厌那个阳台， 我讨厌那个房间，我讨厌那个房子。
And that's architecture.,那就是建筑。
Done.,就这样。
"That feeling, those emotions that I felt,  that's the power of architecture,  because architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning,  it's about those visceral, emotional connections  that we feel to the places that we occupy.",那种感觉，那种情绪， 那就是建筑的力量， 因为建筑并不有关于数学 也不关乎分区规划， 建筑关乎本能， 以及我们对所占有空间的 情感连接。
"And it's no surprise that we feel that way,  because according to the EPA,  Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors.",也难怪我们有这样的感觉， 美国环境保护局的调查表明， 美国人90%的时间呆在室内。
That's 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture.,也就是说，我们人生中 90%的时间被建筑物围绕着。
That's huge.,真的太久了。
That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize.,建筑在我们不曾意识到的 多个方面形塑我们。
"That makes us a little bit gullible and very, very predictable.",那让我们很容易受骗， 也非常，非常可以预测。
"It means that when I show you a building like this,  I know what you think:  You think ""power"" and ""stability"" and ""democracy.""",当我将这个建筑展示给你的时候， 我知道你在想什么： 你想到“权力” 和 “稳定” 还有“民主”。
"And I know you think that because it's based on a building  that was build 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.",我知道因为这个建筑 是希腊人于2500年前建造的。
This is a trick.,这是个骗局。

"This is the Livingston Public Library  that was completed in 2004 in my hometown,  and, you know, it's got a dome  and it's got this round thing and columns, red brick,  and you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building:  children, property values and history.",这是我家乡的Livingston公共图书馆 于2004年完工， 你知道的，它有圆形的屋顶 有这样的圆形设计和柱子，红色的砖， 你可以由此猜测出Livingston 想要通过这个建筑表达些什么： 儿童、财产价值和历史。

"It's a long story,  but the core idea is just that what you get  from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms, in brain-based terms,  is stories about the functioning of a system,  its structure, its dynamics,  the behavior it produces,  great for solving the easy problems —  how we behave, how we function —  but when it comes to subjective experience —  why does all this feel like something from the inside? —",说来话长， 但是这个故事的核心就是 你从在物理方面，在基于大脑方面的 纯粹的还原论者的解释中得到的东西， 是关于一个系统的功能、 它的结构、它的动力、 以及它所产生的行为的， 它可以很好地解决简单问题—— 比如说我们如何表现，我们如何活动—— 但是当它涉及到主观体验时—— 比如说为什么所有这些都感觉像是来自内心的某些东西？——

"On the one hand, it's a datum  that we're conscious.",一方面，它是一个已知数 即我们是有意识的。
"On the other hand, we don't know how  to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world.",另一方面，我们却并不知道 如何使它与我们的科学的世界观相适应。
"So I think consciousness right now  is a kind of anomaly,  one that we need to integrate  into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.",所以我认为就目前而言意识 是一种反常事物， 是一种需要我们将它整合到 我们的世界观中，而我们却还不知道如何整合的事物。
"Faced with an anomaly like this,  radical ideas may be needed,  and I think that we may need one or two ideas  that initially seem crazy  before we can come to grips with consciousness  scientifically. Now, there are a few candidates  for what those crazy ideas might be.",面对这样的反常事物， 我们可能需要一些激进的想法， 并且我认为我们可能需要一两个 在我们可以科学地 面对意识之前 看起来很疯狂的想法。 现在，对于这些疯狂的想法可能是什么
"My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.",已经有了一些候选项。 我的朋友丹·丹尼特就有一个这样的想法，他今天也在这里。
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem  of consciousness.,他的疯狂想法是关于意识 的困难问题并不存在。
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie  involves a kind of illusion or confusion.,整个内心主观电影的想法 涉及一种幻觉或困惑。
"Actually, all we've got to do is explain  the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,  and then we've explained everything  that needs to be explained.",事实上，我们现在要做的就是解释 客观功能和大脑行为， 然后自然地我们就解释了 所有需要被解释的。
"Well I say, more power to him.",我想说，给他更多的能量。
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore  if you want to have a purely reductionist  brain-based theory of consciousness.,这就是那种我们需要去探索的 激进想法， 如果你想获得关于意识的 纯还原论者的基于大脑的理论的话。
"At the same time, for me and for many other people,  that view is a bit too close to simply  denying the datum of consciousness  to be satisfactory.",同时，对于我和其他很多人来说， 这个观点有一点太接近于简单地 否认关于意识的已知资料 而不能令人满意。
So I go in a different direction.,因此我选择了另一个不同的方向。
"In the time remaining,  I want to explore two crazy ideas  that I think may have some promise.",在余下的时间里， 我想探讨两个我认为可能有希望的 疯狂想法。
The first crazy idea  is that consciousness is fundamental.,第一种疯狂想法是 意识是一种基本概念。
Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe  as fundamental building blocks:  space and time and mass.,物理学家有时候会把宇宙中的某些方面 作为基本概念，如： 空间、时间和质量。
"They postulate fundamental laws governing them,  like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.",他们设定了一些基本定律去管理它们， 例如重力定律和量子力学定律。
These fundamental properties and laws  aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.,这些基本性质和定律 不能解释一些更基础的东西。
"Rather, they're taken as primitive,  and you build up the world from there.",这相当于以它们为根本， 然后你在它们的基础上建立这个世界。
"Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.",现在，这张基本定律名单会不时扩大。
"In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out  that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals —  space, time, mass, Newton's laws —  so he postulated fundamental laws  of electromagnetism  and postulated electric charge  as a fundamental element  that those laws govern.",在19世纪，麦克斯韦断定 你无法用当时存在的基本概念—— 空间、时间、质量、牛顿定律—— 去解释电磁现象， 因此他设定了电磁学的 基本定律， 并且设定了电荷 作为这些定律的 基本元素。
I think that's the situation we're in  with consciousness.,我认为这与我们在研究意识上的 情形是一样的。
"If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals —  space, time, mass, charge —  then as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.",如果我们不能用现存的基本概念—— 时间、空间、质量、电荷—— 去解释意识， 那么从逻辑上而言，你需要去扩充这张名单。
"The natural thing to do is to postulate  consciousness itself as something fundamental,  a fundamental building block of nature.",接下来将意识本身设定为 某种根本性的东西， 作为自然界的基本概念就是一件自然而然的事。
This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.,这并不意味着突然间你不能用它来研究科学了。
This opens up the way for you to do science with it.,这反而是为你开僻了一条用它来研究科学的道路。
"What we then need is to study  the fundamental laws governing consciousness,  the laws that connect consciousness  to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,  physical processes.",然后我们需要做的就是研究 那些掌控着意识的基本定律， 那些将意识与其它基本概念—— 空间、时间、质量、物理过程—— 联系在一起的定律。
Physicists sometimes say  that we want fundamental laws so simple  that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.,物理学家有时候说 我们希望那些基本定律可以简单到 能够把它们写在T恤上。
Well I think something like that is the situation  we're in with consciousness.,我想我们在对意识的研究上 也应该这样。
We want to find fundamental laws so simple  we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.,我希望我们发现的关于意识的基本定律也可以简单到 能够把它们写在T恤上。
"We don't know what those laws are yet,  but that's what we're after.",我们现在还不知道这些定律是什么， 但这是我们正在寻找的。
The second crazy idea  is that consciousness might be universal.,第二个疯狂的想法 是意识也许是普通存在的。
Every system might have some degree  of consciousness.,也许每个系统都有某种程度的 意识。
"This view is sometimes called panpsychism:  pan for all, psych for mind,  every system is conscious,  not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,  but even Rob Knight's microbes,  elementary particles.",这种观点有时被称作泛心论： 万物皆有精神或心理活动， 每个系统都具有意识， 不仅是人类、狗、老鼠、苍蝇， 甚至连罗伯·奈特的微生物、 基本粒子都具有意识。
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.,甚至连一个光子都有某种程度的意识。
The idea is not that photons are intelligent  or thinking.,这个观点不是说光子是智能的 或者能思考的。
"It's not that a photon  is wracked with angst  because it's thinking, ""Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light.",不是说一个光子 会由于焦虑而被破坏， 而这种焦虑是因为它想着“哦，我总是以接近光速的速度
"I never get to slow down and smell the roses.""",紧张地跑来跑去，从来没有放慢速度来闻一闻玫瑰花香“。
"No, not like that.",不，事情不是这样子的。
"But the thought is maybe photons might have  some element of raw, subjective feeling,  some primitive precursor to consciousness.",这种观点想要表达的是也许光子可能会有 一些原始的、主观的体验， 一些原始的意识的前兆。
This may sound a bit kooky to you.,对你来说，这听起来可能有点怪。
"I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?",我的意思是，为什么不可以有人思考这样疯狂的事呢？
"Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,  that consciousness is fundamental.",有一些动机来自第一个疯狂想法， 即意识是基本概念。
"If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,  it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,  the way they are.",如果它是基本概念，就像空间、时间和质量一样， 那么很自然地可以假定它也可能具有普遍性， 就像其它的基本概念一样。
"It's also worth noting that although the idea  seems counterintuitive to us,  it's much less counterintuitive to people  from different cultures,  where the human mind is seen as much more  continuous with nature.",还有一点值得注意的是虽然这个想法 对我们来说是违反直觉的， 但对来自其他文化的人来说 可能就不是那么违反直觉了， 那些人的心灵 跟自然联系在一起的时间更长。
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that  perhaps the most simple and powerful way  to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness  to physical processing  is to link consciousness to information.,从这个想法中得到的一个更深的动机是 也许找出将意识与物理过程 联系在一起的 最简单和最有力的方式 就是将意识与信息相结合。
"Wherever there's information processing,  there's consciousness.",有信息处理的地方 就有意识。
"Complex information processing, like in a human,  complex consciousness.",复杂的信息处理，比如说人类的信息处理， 伴随着复杂的意识。
"Simple information processing,  simple consciousness.",简单的信息处理， 伴随着简单的意识。
"A really exciting thing is in recent years  a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,  has taken this kind of theory  and developed it rigorously  with a mathematical theory.",一件令人很兴奋的事是最近几年 有一个神经科学家，朱利奥·托诺尼 采用了这种理论 并且严格按照数学理论 的方式发展了它。
"He has a mathematical measure  of information integration  which he calls phi,  measuring the amount of information  integrated in a system.",他有一个关于信息整合 的数学测量， 他称之为phi， 他用它来测量 一个系统中的信息整合的量。
And he supposes that phi goes along  with consciousness.,他推断phi 是与意识相关的。
"So in a human brain,  incredibly large amount of information integration,  high degree of phi,  a whole lot of consciousness.",所以在人类的大脑中， 有着令人难以置信的信息整合量， 高度的phi值， 一大堆的意识。
"In a mouse, medium degree of information integration,  still pretty significant,  pretty serious amount of consciousness.",在老鼠的大脑中，有中度的信息整合量， 但仍然数目庞大， 仍然具有大量的意识。
"But as you go down to worms,  microbes, particles,  the amount of phi falls off.",但是当你将研究目标降至蠕虫、 微生物、粒子， phi的值就会跌落。
"The amount of information integration falls off,  but it's still non-zero.",信息整合量会跌落， 但不会为零。
"On Tononi's theory,  there's still going to be a non-zero degree  of consciousness.",在托诺尼的理论中， 意识程度 也不会降为零。
"In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law  of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.",事实上，他正在提出这样一个关于意识的 基本定律：phi值越高，意识度也越高。
"Now, I don't know if this theory is right,  but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now  in the science of consciousness,  and it's been used to integrate a whole range  of scientific data,  and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough  you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.",现在，我不知道这个理论是否正确， 但是实际上或许它正处于 意识科学的理论前沿， 并且它已经被用于整合 各方面的科学数据， 它还有一个很好的属性就是它足够简单， 简单到你可以将它写在T恤上。
Another final motivation is that  panpsychism might help us to integrate  consciousness into the physical world.,另外一个最终动机就是 泛心论可以帮助我们 将意识和物理世界相结合。
Physicists and philosophers have often observed  that physics is curiously abstract.,物理学家和哲学家经常注意到 物理学是深奥抽象的。
"It describes the structure of reality  using a bunch of equations,  but it doesn't tell us about the reality  that underlies it.",它用一连串的方程式 去描述现实结构， 但是它又不告诉我们 构成它的现实基础。
"As Stephen Hawking puts it,  what puts the fire into the equations?",正如史蒂芬·霍金所说， 是什么将火放进方程式的？
"Well, on the panpsychist view,  you can leave the equations of physics as they are,  but you can take them to be describing  the flux of consciousness.",而在泛心论者看来， 物理方程可以是它现在的样子， 但是你也可以用它来描述 意识的量。
"That's what physics really is ultimately doing,  describing the flux of consciousness.",这是物理学最终要做的， 描述意识的量。
"On this view, it's consciousness  that puts the fire into the equations.",用这种观点看来，是意识 将火放到了方程中。
"On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle  outside the physical world  as some kind of extra.",在那种观点看来，意识 不是晃荡在物质世界之外 的特别的东西。
It's there right at its heart.,它存在于物质世界的核心。
"This view, I think, the panpsychist view,  has the potential to transfigure our relationship  to nature,  and it may have some pretty serious social  and ethical consequences.",我认为，这种泛心论者的观点， 有那种使我们对我们与自然的关系产生改观 的潜能， 并且它可能产生一些相当严重的 社会和伦理方面的后果。
Some of these may be counterintuitive.,它们当中的一些可能是违反直觉的。
"I used to think I shouldn't eat anything  which is conscious,  so therefore I should be vegetarian.",我曾经想我不可以 吃任何有意识的东西， 因此我要做一个素食主义者。
"Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,  you're going to go very hungry.",但是现，如果你是一个泛心论者并且采用这种观点， 你只能挨饿。
"So I think when you think about it,  this tends to transfigure your views,  whereas what matters for ethical purposes  and moral considerations,  not so much the fact of consciousness,  but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.",因此我想当你思考它的时候， 这将会使你有改变观点的倾向， 然而对于伦理目标 和道德考量来说 最重要的不是关于意识的事实， 而是意识的程度和复杂性。
"It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers.",探讨其它系统，比如说电脑中的意识
"What about the artificially intelligent system  in the movie ""Her,"" Samantha?",也是一件很自然的事情。 比如说电影《她》中的 人工智能系统萨曼莎是什么情况？
Is she conscious?,她有意识吗？
"Well, if you take the informational,  panpsychist view,  she certainly has complicated information processing  and integration,  so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.",如果你用这种信息性的， 泛心论者的角度来看， 她的确能进行复杂的信息处理 和整合， 所以答案很有可能是“是”，她是有意识的。
"If that's right, it raises pretty serious  ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems  and the ethics of turning them off.",如果这个答案正确的话， 那么不管是开发智能计算机系统 或者关闭他们 都会引起严重的伦理问题。
"Finally, you might ask about the consciousness  of whole groups,  the planet.",最后，你可能会询问 集体意识、 行星的意识。
Does Canada have its own consciousness?,加拿大有它自己的意识吗？
"Or at a more local level,  like the audience at a TED conference,  are we right now having a collective TED consciousness,  for this collective TED group  which is distinct from the inner movies  of each of our parts?",或者在一个更地方的层面来说， 一个由一场TED大会的听众 所组成的集体 拥有集体的TED意识吗， 这个TED集体 的内在电影 是与我们每个人自己 的内在电影不同吗？
"I don't know the answer to that question,  but I think it's at least one  worth taking seriously.",我不知道这个问题的答案， 但我觉得至少它 值得重视。
"Okay, so this panpsychist vision,  it is a radical one,  and I don't know that it's correct.",好了，这就是泛心论者的观点， 它是一个激进的想法， 而我不知道它是否正确。
"I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea,  that consciousness is fundamental,  than about the second one,  that it's universal.",事实上我对第一个疯狂想法 即意识是一种基本概念， 要比对第二个疯狂想法 即意识是普遍存在的 要更有把握。
"I mean, the view raises any number of questions,  has any number of challenges,  like how do those little bits  of consciousness add up  to the kind of complex consciousness  If we can answer those questions,  then I think we're going to be well on our way  to a serious theory of consciousness.",我的意思是，这个观点引起了很多问题， 拥有很多挑战， 比如说那些小的意识 是如何添加到 我们了解和喜爱 的复杂意识中去的。 如果我们能够回答这些问题， 那么我想我们就会在通往 关于意识的严肃理论的道路上顺利走下去。
"If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps  in science and philosophy.",如果不能，那么这可能成为 科学上和哲学上最难解的问题。
We can't expect to solve it overnight.,我们不能期盼一个晚上就能解决这个问题。
But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.,但是我相信我们终将弄明白它。
"Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,  both to understanding the universe  and to understanding ourselves.",我想，理解意识是 我们理解宇宙 和理解我们自己的一个关键。
It may just take the right crazy idea.,而做到这一点也许只需要我们采用正确的疯狂想法。
Thank you.,谢谢。
"I grew up in a very small country town  I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.",我在维多利亚的 一个小乡镇长大。 我受的教育平凡而普通。

"And my parents said, ""Hm, that's really nice,  but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.",我的父母说：“嗯，这是件好事儿， 不过有个比较明显的问题。
"She hasn't actually achieved anything.""   And they were right, you know.",她从来也没取得什么成就啊。“ 他们说的对。
"I went to school, I got good marks,  I had a very low-key after school job  in my mum's hairdressing salon,  and I spent a lot of time watching  ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Dawson's Creek.""",我上学，成绩还不错。 毕业之后在妈妈的 发型设计沙龙有个很普通的工作， 我还花很多时间看各种肥皂剧， 比如”吸血鬼猎人巴菲“和”恋爱时代“。
"Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.",没错，是有点矛盾。
"But they were right, you know.",不过他们说得对，
I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary  at all.,我压根儿也没有过任何 不寻常的作为。
I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement  if you took disability out of the equation.,我从来也没做过任何可以被当做是成就的事情， 如果不考虑身体有缺陷这一点的话。
"Years later, I was on my second teaching round  in a Melbourne high school,  and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class  when this boy put up his hand and said,  ""Hey miss, when are you going to start doing your speech?""",几年以后，我再次回到 一个墨尔本高中的教书， 当我在11年级的一堂法律课上刚讲了大概20分钟时， 一个男孩举手问道： “女士，你什么时候才能开始演讲？”
"And I said, ""What speech?""",我说：”什么演讲？“
"You know, I'd been talking them  about defamation law for a good 20 minutes.",事实上，我已经就诽谤法 讲了二十多分钟了。
"And he said, ""You know, like,  your motivational speaking.",然后他说：”比方说 励志演说什么的。
"You know, when people in wheelchairs come to school,  they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?""",当坐着轮椅的人来到学校， 他们一般都会说一些鼓舞人心的故事，是吧？“
"""It's usually in the big hall.""",”不过这种演讲一般都是在大报告厅里进行的呀。“
And that's when it dawned on me:  This kid had only ever experienced disabled people  as objects of inspiration.,就是在那个时候我开始意识到： 这孩子一直把残障人士当做 一种励志对象。
"We are not, to this kid --  and it's not his fault, I mean,  that's true for many of us.",对这个孩子来说，我们并不是什么激励对象， 这也不是他的错， 很多人都有这种想法。
"For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers  or our doctors or our manicurists.",对很多人来说，残障人士并不是老师， 医生或者美甲师。
We're not real people. We are there to inspire.,我们不是真实的人，我们的存在只是为了激励别人。
"And in fact, I am sitting on this stage  looking like I do in this wheelchair,  and you are probably kind of expecting me  to inspire you. Right?   Yeah.",现在，我在这个讲台上， 坐着轮椅演讲， 你们可能多少也会期待我 能对你们有所激励，对吧？（观众笑声） 我说的没错吧。
"Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid  I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.",不过，女士们先生们，恐怕 我要让你们非常失望了。
I am not here to inspire you.,我在这里不是为了激励你们。
I am here to tell you that we have been lied to  about disability.,我来这儿是想告诉你们 我们对残疾有错误的认识。
"Yeah, we've been sold the lie  that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.",没错，我们一直被错误的灌输 残疾是件坏事，很——糟——糕的事。
"It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability  makes you exceptional.",这是件坏事，带着残缺生活 会让你与众不同。
"It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't  make you exceptional.",其实，这并不是件坏事， 也不会让你变得多出众。
"And in the past few years, we've been able  to propagate this lie even further  via social media.",在过去的几年，这个谎言 通过社交媒体 被传的更广了。
"You may have seen images like this one:  ""The only disability in life is a bad attitude.""",你们可能看过这样的图片： ”生活中唯一的残缺就是消极的态度。“
"Or this one: ""Your excuse is invalid."" Indeed.",或者这个：”你的理由不成立。”
"Or this one: ""Before you quit, try!""",亦或者：“不要轻易放弃，继续尝试！”
"These are just a couple of examples,  but there are a lot of these images out there.",这只是其中的几个例子， 这样的图片还有很多。
"You know, you might have seen the one,  the little girl with no hands  drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.",你们还可能看到过这个， 一个没有手臂的小女孩儿 把笔刁在嘴里画画。
You might have seen a child running  on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.,你们可能也见过一个孩子借助 碳纤维义肢奔跑。
"And these images,  there are lots of them out there,  they are what we call inspiration porn.",类似这样的图片， 太多了， 我们管这些叫励志情色片。
"And I use the term porn deliberately,  because they objectify one group of people  for the benefit of another group of people.",（观众笑声） 我故意用“情色片”这个词的， 因为他们为了另一群人的利益， 而把一群人物化。
"So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people  for the benefit of nondisabled people.",现在，我们正在物化残障人士， 以满足非残障人士的利益。
"The purpose of these images  is to inspire you, to motivate you,  so that we can look at them  and think, ""Well, however bad my life is,  it could be worse.",这些图片是 想要鼓舞你们，激励你们， 这样我们看到这些残疾人的时候 就会想：“哦，我的生活再糟， 也还是有比我更糟的。
"I could be that person.""",还好我不是那个人。”
But what if you are that person?,但如果你就是那个人呢？
"I've lost count of the number of times that I've  been approached by strangers  wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave  or inspirational,  and this was long before my work  had any kind of public profile.",我已经记不清有几次， 有陌生人向我走过来， 想要告诉我他们认为我很勇敢， 很励志， 这还是在我没有 成为公众人物之前的事。
They were just kind of congratulating me  for managing to get up in the morning  and remember my own name.   And it is objectifying.,他们只是因为我早上能够正常起床， 还能记着我自己的名字 而祝贺我。（观众笑声） 这就是物化。
"These images, those images  objectify disabled people  for the benefit of nondisabled people.",这些图片 物化了残障人士，好让他们 能够激励非残障人士。
"They are there so that you can look at them  and think that things aren't so bad for you,  to put your worries into perspective.",他们的存在，就在于能够让你们 庆幸自己过的还不坏， 把担心抛在脑后。
And life as a disabled person  is actually somewhat difficult.,不过残障人士的生活 的确有些挑战。
We do overcome some things.,我们确实需要克服一些困难。
But the things that we're overcoming  are not the things that you think they are.,不过我们需要克服的那些事 跟你们想像的不一样。
They are not things to do with our bodies.,这些事跟我们身体本身的缺陷没什么关系。
"I use the term ""disabled people"" quite deliberately,  because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability,  which tells us that we are more disabled  by the society that we live in  than by our bodies and our diagnoses.",我刻意使用“残疾人”这个词， 因为我可以接受这种社会普遍认同的残疾， 这让我们认识到，相比较我们身体本身的 缺陷和病症，我们所居住的社会 让我们更觉得自己是残疾人。
So I have lived in this body a long time.,其实我像现在这样已经相当久了。
I'm quite fond of it.,感觉还挺不错的。
"It does the things that I need it to do,  and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity  just as you have,  and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.",我想做什么都能做， 而且我也知道怎么做那些力所能及的事儿， 就跟你们一样， 图片里的那些孩子也是这样。

"So is it really fair to objectify them  in the way that we do,  to share those images?",那么通过传播这些图片 来物化他们 真的公平吗？
"People, when they say, ""You're an inspiration,""  they mean it as a compliment.",当人们说：”你真励志，” 他们以为这是一种赞美。
And I know why it happens.,我知道大家为什么这么做。
"It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold  this lie that disability makes you exceptional.",是因为我们一直以来都被灌输一种错误的思想： 残缺可以让你变得出色。
And it honestly doesn't.,其实不是。
And I know what you're thinking.,我知道你们在想什么。
"You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,  and you're thinking, ""Jeez, Stella,  aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?""",我在讲台上否认这种激励作用， 你们就会想：“天呐，史黛拉， 难道你就不会受其他事物的激励吗？”

I learn from other disabled people all the time.,我无时无刻不在从其他残障人士身上学习。
"I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.",不过我学习，并不是我比他们幸运多少。

Genius.,太有才了！
"We are learning from each others' strength and endurance,  not against our bodies and our diagnoses,  but against a world that exceptionalizes  and objectifies us.",我们互相学习彼此的坚强和隐忍， 不是对抗身体缺陷和疾病的坚强， 而是对抗整个社会区别对待我们， 物化我们的这种风气。
I really think that this lie that we've been sold  about disability is the greatest injustice.,我真心认为这种针对我们残障人士的谎言 就是最大的不公。
It makes life hard for us.,这让我们的生活变得很困难。
"And that quote, ""The only disability in life  is a bad attitude,""  the reason that that's bullshit  is because it's just not true,  because of the social model of disability.",还有那句名言：”生活中唯一的残疾 就是消极的态度“， 这简直就是胡说八道， 因为事实根本不是这样 这只是社会认同的残疾。
No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs  has ever made it turn into a ramp.,笑的再多也不会让你费力攀爬的楼梯 变成可以通过轮椅的斜坡。

No amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop  and radiating a positive attitude  is going to turn all those books into braille.,在书店里呆的再久， 释放再积极的正能量， 也不能把这些书变成盲文。

I want to live in a world  where we don't have such low expectations  of disabled people  that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning.,在我期望的社会里， 人们不放低他们对 残障人士的期待， 不会因为他们早上能正常起床， 记得自己的名字
"I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement  for disabled people,  and I want to live in a world  where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school  is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.",就对他们大加赞赏。 我期待的社会，人们会认可残障人士 真正的成就， 我期待的社会里， 一个墨尔本高中11岁的孩子 不会因为他的新老师需要轮椅代步
"Disability doesn't make you exceptional,  but questioning what you think you know about it does.",残障不会让你变得出色， 但质疑你原本自以为了解的事物，可以让你进步。
Thank you.,谢谢大家。

"When Malala was in the hospital,  and she was going through the severe pains  and she had had severe headaches  because her facial nerve was cut down,  I used to see a dark shadow  spreading on the face of my wife.",当马拉拉在医院的时候， 她忍受着巨大的痛苦， 她头痛极为严重， 因为她的面部神经被切断了， 我妻子的脸 成天被阴云笼罩着。
But my daughter never complained.,但我的女儿从来没有抱怨。
"She used to tell us,  ""I'm fine with my crooked smile  and with my numbness in my face.",她会告诉我们， “微笑奇怪，面部僵硬， 这些都没有关系。
"I'll be okay. Please don't worry.""",我会好起来的，别担心。”
"She was a solace for us,  and she consoled us.",她是我们的安慰， 给我们带来慰藉。
"Dear brothers and sisters,  we learned from her how to be resilient  in the most difficult times,  and I'm glad to share with you  that despite being an icon  for the rights of children and women,  she is like any 16-year old girl.",亲爱的兄弟姐妹们， 从她身上，我学到了 在困境中如何变得坚强， 我也很乐意和你们分享， 尽管她如今是 儿童权利和妇女权利领域的重要人物， 她和其他16岁的女孩没有什么不同。

"I had brain surgery 18 years ago,  and since that time, brain science has become  a personal passion of mine.",我18年前做过脑部手术， 从那时起， 我就非常热衷于脑科学研究。
I'm actually an engineer.,我的本职其实是工程师。
"And first let me say, I recently joined  Google's Moonshot group,  where I had a division,  the display division in Google X,  and the brain science work I'm speaking about today  is work I did before I joined Google  and on the side outside of Google.",首先我要声明，我最近参加了 谷歌的登月组， 我在谷歌X 负责那里的显示部门。 但是今天我要谈到的脑科学方面的研究， 是我加入谷歌之前做的， 在谷歌之外做的。
"So that said, there's a stigma  when you have brain surgery.",现在说正题。¶ 做过脑手术之后就出现这样一个问题：
Are you still smart or not?,你还和以前一样聪明吗?
"And if not, can you make yourself smart again?",如果不是，你还能重新变聪明吗？
"After my neurosurgery,  part of my brain was missing,  and I had to deal with that.",我做了神经手术之后， 大脑少了一部分， 而我得接受这个事实。
"It wasn't the grey matter, but it was the gooey part dead center  that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.",不是灰质部分，而是正中间黏糊糊的部分， 那里是产生关键的激素和神经递质的地方。
"Immediately after my surgery,  a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,  because if I just took nothing,  I would die within hours.",在手术刚刚结束之后， 我就得决定每天要吃的十几种强力药物里， 每一种吃多少。 如果什么药都不吃， 几个小时内我就会死掉。
"Every day now for 18 years -- every single day --  I've had to try to decide the combinations  and mixtures of chemicals,  and try to get them, to stay alive.",18年来每天，每一天， 我都得决定我需要吃什么样的 药以及如何搭配它们， 把这些药找来吃，让自己活下去。
There have been several close calls.,有几次都差点没命。
"But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,  so I decided I would experiment  to try to find more optimal dosages  because there really isn't a clear road map  on this that's detailed.",不过幸好我打心底里是个实验科学家， 所以我觉得我要试验一下， 找到更合适的剂量， 因为这方面实在是没有个详细的 路线图可参考。
"I began to try different mixtures,  and I was blown away by how  tiny changes in dosages  dramatically changed my sense of self,  my sense of who I was, my thinking,  my behavior towards people.",我开始尝试不同的药物搭配， 而我完全没有想到的是， 剂量上的微小改变 竟然会剧烈地改变我的自我感觉， 我认为自己是谁，我的想法， 我对待他人的行为。
"One particularly dramatic case:  for a couple months I actually tried dosages  and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,  and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.",一个非常极端的例子： 有几个月我尝试的药物和剂量 正常是用于20出头的男性的。 让我非常惊讶的是我的想法完全改变了。
"I was angry all the time,  I thought about sex constantly,  and I thought I was the smartest person  in the entire world, and  ——  of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that,  or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.",我总是非常生气， 我不停地想到性， 而且我觉得自己是 世界上最聪明的人，  当然这些年来我遇到过这样的男人， 或者是没这么夸张但也类似的男人。
I was kind of extreme.,我那样的比较极端。
"But to me, the surprise was,  I wasn't trying to be arrogant.",对我来说，让我惊讶的是， 我并不是想要做个傲慢的人，
"I was actually trying,  with a little bit of insecurity,  to actually fix a problem in front of me,  and it just didn't come out that way.",我实际上是想， 虽然不是很确定， 要解决摆在我面前的一个问题， 可结果却不是那样的。
So I couldn't handle it.,我受不了了，
I changed my dosages.,于是改了药的剂量。
"But that experience, I think, gave me  a new appreciation for men  and what they might walk through,  and I've gotten along with men  a lot better since then.",不过那段经历，我觉得， 让我对男性有了新的认识， 包括他们可能的感受。 而且从那以后 我和男性之间相处得也更好了。
"What I was trying to do  with tuning these hormones  and neurotransmitters and so forth  was to try to get my intelligence back  after my illness and surgery,  my creative thought, my idea flow.",我当时试图 调节这些激素 和神经递质等的剂量， 我想要做的是 在生病和手术之后，重新找回我的智慧， 我的创造性思维，我的思考能力。
"And I think mostly in images,  and so for me that became a key metric --  how to get these mental images  that I use as a way of rapid prototyping,  if you will, my ideas,  trying on different new ideas for size,  playing out scenarios.",我主要是通过图像来思考的， 所以对我来说最关键的， 就是如何找回这些大脑中的图像， 因为我是用图像来快速地构建原型想法的。 只要我愿意，我的想法， 会尝试不同规模的新想法， 设想各种场景。
This kind of thinking isn't new.,这种思维方式并不罕见。
Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes  saw things similarly.,哲学家们，像休谟、笛卡儿、霍布斯 也是这样看事情的。
They thought that mental images and ideas  were actually the same thing.,他们认为脑中的图像和思想 是一回事。
"There are those today that dispute that,  and lots of debates about how the mind works,  but for me it's simple:  Mental images, for most of us,  are central in inventive and creative thinking.",现在有很多人质疑这一点， 也有很多关于大脑如何思考的争论， 但对我来说很简单： 对大多数人来说，大脑中的图像 是在创造性思考中处于核心地位。
"So after several years,  I tuned myself up and I have lots of great,  really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication  and the analytical backbone behind them.",在我试验了几年之后， 我找到了合适的药物剂量， 我脑中开始出现了很多栩栩如生 又非常复杂的图像， 还有图像中包含的思路。
"And so now I'm working on,  how can I get these mental images in my mind  out to my computer screen faster?",现在我在做的， 就是如何把我脑子中的这些图像 更快地传到我的电脑屏幕上?
"Can you imagine, if you will,  a movie director being able to use  her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?",想像一下， 如果一个电影导演仅靠她的想象力 就可以导演她眼前的世界?
Or a musician to get the music out of his head?,或者一个音乐家这样就能把他脑子里的音乐传出来?
There are incredible possibilities with this  as a way for creative people  to share at light speed.,这件事有不可思议的可能性， 它可以让有创造性的人们 以闪电般的速度来分享想法。
"And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck  in being able to do this  is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.",事实上，要实现这一点 现在剩下的瓶颈仅仅在于 提高大脑扫描系统的分辨率。
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting there  by sharing with you two recent experiments  from two top neuroscience groups.,现在我要给大家看看， 为什么我觉得我们已经接近成功了， 我要展示两个近期的实验， 分别是在两个顶级的脑科学研究组做的。
"Both used fMRI technology --  functional magnetic resonance imaging technology --  to image the brain,  and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis  and his colleagues at Harvard.",他们都用了fMRI技术 也就是功能性核磁共振成像技术 来对大脑进行造影。 这套大脑扫描图是 哈佛的吉奥吉欧•加尼斯和他的同事们做的。
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan  of a person looking at an image.,左边一列扫描的 是一个正看着一张图的人的大脑。
"The middle column shows the brainscan  of that same individual  imagining, seeing that same image.",中间一列 是同一个人的大脑扫描图， 但他只是在想像看刚才那张图片，
"And the right column was created  by subtracting the middle column from the left column,  showing the difference to be nearly zero.",右边一列是将 中间的图从左边的图减去后得到的 可以看出来差别几乎为零。
"This was repeated on lots of different individuals  with lots of different images,  always with a similar result.",这个实验在很多不同的人身上重复过， 而且用了很多不同的图片， 结果几乎总是一样。
The difference between seeing an image  and imagining seeing that same image  is next to nothing.,真正看一张图片 和想像看同一张图片 之间几乎没有差别。
"Next let me share with you one other experiment,  this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.",下面我再给你们看一个实验， 是在加州大学伯克利分校 杰克•加蓝特的实验室做的。
They've been able to decode brainwaves  into recognizable visual fields.,他们有办法将脑电波 转换成可识别的视图。
So let me set this up for you.,我来演示一下。
"In this experiment, individuals were shown  hundreds of hours of YouTube videos  while scans were made of their brains  to create a large library of their brain reacting  to video sequences.",在这个实验里，受试者 要看几百小时的youtube视频， 看的时候他们的大脑会被扫描， 这样就建立了一个巨大的数据库，里面纪录下了 他们的大脑对一系列视频的反应，
"Then a new movie was shown with new images,  new people, new animals in it,  and a new scan set was recorded.",然后给他们看一段新视频，里面有新的图像， 新的人物，新的动物， 并且新的大脑扫描图也被纪录下来。
"The computer, using brain scan data alone,  decoded that new brain scan  to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing.",电脑仅仅通过大脑扫描数据 就可以解析新的扫描图， 推测出受试者实际看到的是什么图像。
"On the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess,  and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.",右边是电脑的猜测， 而左边是给受试者看的片段。
This is the jaw-dropper.,这真是让人印象极为深刻。
We are so close to being able to do this.,我们离真正实现这一点已经不远了，
We just need to up the resolution.,只是需要提高分辨率。
"And now remember that when you see an image  versus when you imagine that same image,  it creates the same brain scan.",请记住当你看一副图片 或者你想同一副图片时， 大脑扫描的结果是一样的。
"So this was done with the highest-resolution  brain scan systems available today,  and their resolution has increased really  about a thousandfold in the last several years.",这是用当今分辨率最高的 大脑扫描系统做的。 这个系统的分辨率在近几年里 提高了将近一千倍。
Next we need to increase the resolution  another thousandfold  to get a deeper glimpse.,下一步我们需要将分辨率 再提高一千倍， 才能看得更深。
How do we do that?,我们怎样实现呢？
There's a lot of techniques in this approach.,这方面有很多技术可用。
One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes.,一种方法是把头骨撬开把电极放进去，
I'm not for that.,我不做这个。
"There's a lot of new imaging techniques  being proposed, some even by me,  but given the recent success of MRI,  first we need to ask the question,  is it the end of the road with this technology?",还有很多新的成像技术被提出来， 有些还是我提出来的， 不过考虑到最近在核磁共振上的成功， 我们首先应该问的问题是， 这项技术已经发展到尽头了吗？
"Conventional wisdom says the only way  to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,  but at this point bigger magnets  only offer incremental resolution improvements,  not the thousandfold we need.",传统的观点认为 提高分辨率的唯一方法是用更大的磁铁， 但是现在更大的磁铁只能 带来分辨率的提升只是固定增量的， 不是我们想要的一千倍。
"I'm putting forward an idea:  instead of bigger magnets,  let's make better magnets.",我提出了一个想法： 不用更大的磁铁， 我们来做更好的磁铁。
"There's some new technology breakthroughs  when applied to magnetic structures  that have created a whole new class of magnets,  and with these magnets, we can lay down  very fine detailed magnetic field patterns  throughout the brain,  and using those, we can actually create  holographic-like interference structures  to get precision control over many patterns,  as is shown here by shifting things.",纳米科学方面现在有些技术突破， 而用在磁铁结构上 已经制造出了一种全新类型的磁铁。 用这些磁铁，我们可以 在整个大脑里布置出结构非常细致的磁场模式， 在整个大脑里布置出结构非常细致的磁场模式， 这样我们就能造出 类似于全息的干扰结构， 可以对很多模式进行精确控制， 只要像这样移动一些东西就行了。
"We can create much more complicated structures  with slightly different arrangements,  kind of like making Spirograph.",我们还可以造出更复杂的结构， 只要使用稍微不同的排列就可以了。 有点儿像画螺旋图。
So why does that matter?,这有什么用呢？
"A lot of effort in MRI over the years  has gone into making really big,  really huge magnets, right?",这些年来MRI领域很多人 不是在试图做出 非常非常大的磁铁吗？
But yet most of the recent advances  in resolution have actually come from  ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions  in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers  in the MRI systems.,但是最近分辨率领域的进步， 实际上是源于 MRI系统中 调频电波频率发射和接收器 极为精巧的编码解码方法。
"Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,  put down structured magnetic patterns  in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.",另外，我们可以不再使用总是一样的磁场， 而是用有一定结构的磁场模式， 再加上调频电波频率。
So by combining the magnetics patterns  with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies  processing which can massively increase  the information that we can extract in a single scan.,这样就将磁场模式 与调频电波频率模式相结合， 可以极大地增加 我们在一次扫描中所提取的信息。
"And on top of that, we can then layer  our ever-growing knowledge of brain structure and memory  to create a thousandfold increase that we need.",除此之外， 我们在大脑结构和记忆方面的知识也在不断增加， 我们可以把这些知识整合进去， 就能得到我们想要的1000倍的增长了。
"And using fMRI, we should be able to measure  not just oxygenated blood flow,  but the hormones and neurotransmitters I've talked about  and maybe even the direct neural activity,  which is the dream.",运用fMRI，我们不仅可以 测量携氧的血液流动， 还可以测量我刚才说的激素和神经递质， 甚至有可能直接测量神经活动， 那就是梦。
We're going to be able to dump our ideas  directly to digital media.,那样我们就可以把我们的想法 直接下载到数字媒体上。
Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language  and communicate directly with human thought?,想像一下，如果我们可以不借助语言 而直接交流思想？
What would we be capable of then?,那时候我们能有什么样的成就呢？
And how will we learn to deal  with the truths of unfiltered human thought?,我们要怎样学会面对 未加修饰的，完全真实的人类思想呢？
You think the Internet was big.,你觉得互联网很大，
These are huge questions.,那这些问题就是巨大了。
It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.,把它作为一种工具来放大我们的思考和沟通能力，
"And indeed, this very same tool  may prove to lead to the cure  for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.",这个想法可能让人难以抗拒。 确实，这个方法有可能会带来治疗 阿尔兹海默式症或其它疾病的方法。
We have little option but to open this door.,除了开启这扇门之外，我们别无选择。
"Regardless, pick a year --  will it happen in five years or 15 years?",不管怎样，预测一下， 五年还是十五年之后能实现呢？
It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.,很难想像要花更久的时间。
We need to learn how to take this step together.,我们要一起学习如何一起迈出这一步。
Thank you.,谢谢大家。

"So the next time you find yourself  in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade,  know we have all been there before.",那么下回你发现自己 窝在柜里 手里紧攥着手榴弹时 要知道我们都经历过这个阶段
"And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.",你可能会感到孤独 但实际上不是的
"And we know it's hard but we need you out here,  no matter what your walls are made of,  because I guarantee you there are others  peering through the keyholes of their closets  looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open, so be that person  and show the world that we are bigger than our closets  and that a closet is no place for a person  to truly live.",虽然很难 但是你需要走出柜 不管你的墙是什么 我向你保证 还有些人 从他们柜的锁眼里 寻找下一个勇敢的人推开们 所以做那个勇敢的人吧 让人们知道柜已容不下我们 一个柜不是一个人 能活出真实自己的地方
"Thank you, Boulder. Enjoy your night.",谢谢 Boulder 祝各位晚上愉快
Intelligence -- what is it?,智能--它是什么？
"If we take a look back at the history  of how intelligence has been viewed,  one seminal example has been  Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that  ""the question of whether a machine can think  is about as interesting  as the question of whether a submarine  can swim.""","当我们回顾在历史上 智能是如何被看待的， 一个开创性的例子是 艾兹格•迪杰斯特拉的著名引述， ""关于一台机器能否思考的问题 与关于 一艘潜艇是否会游泳的问题 几乎同样有趣""。"
"Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,  intended it as a criticism  of the early pioneers of computer science,  like Alan Turing.",当艾兹格•迪杰斯特拉 写下这句话的时候， 他的用意是去批判那些 早年间开辟了计算机科学的先锋， 比如阿兰 · 图灵。
"However, if you take a look back  and think about what have been  the most empowering innovations  that enabled us to build  artificial machines that swim  and artificial machines that [fly],  you find that it was only through understanding  the underlying physical mechanisms  of swimming and flight  that we were able to build these machines.",然而，如果你回顾过去 并予以思考，有哪些 最有利于发展的创新， 让我们有机会能够制造出 会游泳的机器 和会[飞]的机器， 你会发现，只有通过了解 游泳和飞行 背后的物理机制， 我们才有能力去制造这些机器。
"And so, several years ago,  I undertook a program to try to understand  the fundamental physical mechanisms  underlying intelligence.",所以说，在几年前， 我着手了一个项目， 试图去了解 智能背后的 基础物理机制。
Let's take a step back.,我们先退一步说。
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.,首先，让我们从一个思维实验开始。
"Pretend that you're an alien race  that doesn't know anything about Earth biology  or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,  but you have amazing telescopes  and you're able to watch the Earth,  and you have amazingly long lives,  so you're able to watch the Earth  over millions, even billions of years.",假装你是一个外星人， 你对地球上的生物学、 神经科学和智能一无所知， 但你有绝佳的望远镜， 因此你能观望地球， 你的寿命也惊人地长， 所以你可以观察地球 超过数百万年，甚至几十亿年。
And you observe a really strange effect.,然后你观察到一个很奇怪的现象。
"You observe that, over the course of the millennia,  Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids  up until a point,  and that at some point,  corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,  asteroids that are on  a collision course with the Earth  that otherwise would have collided  mysteriously get deflected  or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.",你观察到，几千年来， 地球不断地与小行星发生碰撞 直到某一刻， 而在那一刻， 大约对应的是公元2000年， 那些在地球撞击轨道 上的小行星， 本该相撞 但却被神秘地弹开了 或者在碰到地球之前就引爆了。
"Now of course, as earthlings,  we know the reason would be  that we're trying to save ourselves.",当然，作为地球人， 我们知道其中的原因是 我们正试图自我拯救。
We're trying to prevent an impact.,我们要防止撞击发生。
"But if you're an alien race  who doesn't know any of this,  doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,  you'd be forced to put together  a physical theory that explains how,  up until a certain point in time,  asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet  mysteriously stop doing that.",但如果你是一个外星人， 对这些一无所知， 对地球上的智能也没有任何概念， 这就迫使你去总结 一种物理理论， 去解释其原因， 直到在某一刻， 本应摧毁一个星球表面的小行星， 神秘地停止了这种行为。
And so I claim that this is the same question  as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.,因此我声称这个问题 与理解智能的物理本质的问题 是相同的。
"So in this program that I undertook several years ago,  I looked at a variety of different threads  across science, across a variety of disciplines,  that were pointing, I think,  towards a single, underlying mechanism  for intelligence.",因此，在我几年前着手的 这个项目中， 我研究了许多不同的线程， 跨越科学界，跨越多个学科， 在我看来，他们都指向 一个统一的、潜在的 智能机制。
"In cosmology, for example,  there have been a variety of different threads of evidence  that our universe appears to be finely tuned  for the development of intelligence,  and, in particular, for the development  of universal states  that maximize the diversity of possible futures.",例如在宇宙学中， 就存在着各种各样的线索， 它们显示我们的宇宙就 为了智能的开发， 而被精准地调试过， 和特别是的对于发展 世界各国 去实现有最大多样化可能性的未来。
"In game play, for example, in Go --  everyone remembers in 1997  when IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess --  fewer people are aware  that in the past 10 years or so,  the game of Go,  arguably a much more challenging game  because it has a much higher branching factor,  has also started to succumb  to computer game players  for the same reason:  the best techniques right now for computers playing Go",在棋牌界，举个例子，围棋-- 大家都记得在1997年的时候 IBM制作的机器人“深蓝“打败了 世界象棋冠军加里·卡斯帕罗夫-- 很少有人意识到 在过去10年左右的时间里， 围棋， 可以说是一个更具挑战性的游戏， 因为它具有更高的分支系数， 也已开始屈服于 电脑这个游戏对手， 出于同样的原因： 现在，电脑下围棋的 最佳技术方法
are techniques that try to maximize future options  during game play.,是在下棋的过程中， 试图最大化 未来的各种可能性。
"Finally, in robotic motion planning,  there have been a variety of recent techniques  that have tried to take advantage  of abilities of robots to maximize  future freedom of action  in order to accomplish complex tasks.",最后，在机器人的运动规划中， 有各种各样的新颖技术， 它们有试图利用 机器人的能力去将 未来的行动自由最大化， 从而完成复杂的任务。
"And so, taking all of these different threads  and putting them together,  I asked, starting several years ago,  is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence  that we can factor out  of all of these different threads?",因此，考虑所有这些不同的线程 并把它们放在一起， 从几年前开始我就在问， 有没有一种潜在的智能机制 可以让我们分解出 所有这些不同的线程？
Is there a single equation for intelligence?,是否存在一个 关于智能的公式？
"And the answer, I believe, is yes. [""F = T ∇ Sτ""]  What you're seeing is probably  the closest equivalent to an E = mc²  for intelligence that I've seen.","而我相信答案是有。 [""F = T ∇ SΤ""] 你看到的可能是 我所见过最接近于 E = mc² 的智慧。"
"So what you're seeing here  is a statement of correspondence  that intelligence is a force, F,  that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.",所以你在这里看到的 是一张对应表， 其中智能是一种力量，F， 它的作用是为了便于将未来的 行动自由最大化。
"It acts to maximize future freedom of action,  or keep options open,  with some strength T,  with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,  up to some future time horizon, tau.",它的作用是将未来的 行动自由最大化， 或是保留灵活的选择权， 与一种力量 T， 和有多种可能性的、 可实现的未来，S， 一直到某个未来的开始， tau。
"In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.",简而言之，智能不喜欢被困住。
Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action  and keep options open.,智能试图将未来的行动自由最大化， 并保留选择权。
"And so, given this one equation,  it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?",所以，鉴于这一公式， 你自然会问， 那么这些可以让你做什么？
How predictive is it?,它是预测性有多高？
Does it predict human-level intelligence?,它能否预测人类的智能水平？
Does it predict artificial intelligence?,它能够预测人工智能吗？
"So I'm going to show you now a video  that will, I think, demonstrate  some of the amazing applications  of just this single equation.",因此，我将要展示给你们一段视频， 我认为，它会展示出 单是这一个公式的 一些惊人的应用。
"Narrator: Recent research in cosmology  has suggested that universes that produce  more disorder, or ""entropy,"" over their lifetimes  should tend to have more favorable conditions  for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves.","讲述人： 宇宙学的最近研究 反应了那些产生更多混乱、 或者""熵""的宇宙， 在他们的生命中 应该倾向于产生更多 有利的情况， 让像我们这样的智慧生物 得以存在。"
But what if that tentative cosmological connection  between entropy and intelligence  hints at a deeper relationship?,但假如那个在熵与智能之间 暂定的宇宙链接 暗示着更深层的关系呢？
"What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate  with the production of long-term entropy,  but actually emerges directly from it?",如果智能的行为不仅只与 长期熵的生产相关， 而是直接由其产生的呢？
"To find out, we developed a software engine  called Entropica, designed to maximize  the production of long-term entropy  of any system that it finds itself in.",为了找到答案， 我们开发了一个软件引擎 称为 Entropica， 设计的意图是将 长期熵的生产最大化， 无论它身在任何系统内。
"Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass  multiple animal intelligence tests, play human games,  and even earn money trading stocks,  all without being instructed to do so.",惊人的是，Entropica 通过了 多个动物的智能测验、 玩人类的游戏、 甚至在股票交易中赚钱， 而且完全没有被给出那些指示。
Here are some examples of Entropica in action.,下面是一些 Entropica 的行动实例。
"Just like a human standing upright without falling over,  here we see Entropica  automatically balancing a pole using a cart.",就像人类站立不会跌到， 这里我们可以看到 Entropica 自动地使用购物车去平衡棍子。
This behavior is remarkable in part  because we never gave Entropica a goal.,这种行为可以说是非常卓越的 因为我们从未给 Entropica 设定一个目标。
It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.,它自己就决定去平衡那根棍子。
This balancing ability will have appliactions  for humanoid robotics  and human assistive technologies.,这种平衡能力将能应用于 人形机器人 和人类的辅助科技。
"Just as some animals can use objects  in their environments as tools  to reach into narrow spaces,  here we see that Entropica,  again on its own initiative,  was able to move a large disk representing an animal  around so as to cause a small disk,  representing a tool, to reach into a confined space  holding a third disk  and release the third disk from its initially fixed position.",正如一些动物可以使用 环境中的物体作为工具 去伸入狭窄的空间， 这里我们可以看到 Entropica， 同样是自主的， 能够移动一个表示动物的大圆盘 去把一个表示工具的小圆盘， 去深入一个狭窄的空间， 那里有第三个圆盘， 并把第三个圆盘从它初始 的静态解放出来.
This tool use ability will have applications  for smart manufacturing and agriculture.,这种工具的使用能力将能运用于 智能制造业和农业。
"In addition, just as some other animals  are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope  at the same time to release food,  here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish  a model version of that task.",此外，正如其他一些动物 能够合作起来同时去拉 一根绳子的两端 从而释放食物， 这里我们可以看到 Entropica 有能力完成 这项任务的模型版本。
This cooperative ability has interesting implications  for economic planning and a variety of other fields.,这种合作能力能够带来有趣的影响， 在经济规划和各种其他领域中。
Entropica is broadly applicable  to a variety of domains.,Entropica 可以广泛适用于 各种各样的领域。
"For example, here we see it successfully  playing a game of pong against itself,  illustrating its potential for gaming.",例如，在这里我们看到它成功的 与自己玩乒乓球游戏， 说明其在游戏界的潜力。
Here we see Entropica orchestrating  new connections on a social network  where friends are constantly falling out of touch  and successfully keeping the network well connected.,在这里我们看到 Entropica 指挥着 社交网络上新的关系， 在这朋友们不断的失去联系 并成功地保持有效的网络连接。
"This same network orchestration ability  also has applications in health care,  energy, and intelligence.",这种相同的网络指挥能力 在医疗保健、能源、和智能方面 都有相关的应用。
"Here we see Entropica directing the paths  of a fleet of ships,  successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal  to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic  to the Pacific.",这里我们可以看到 Entropica 指挥一支舰队的路径， 成功地发现并利用巴拿马运河， 然后将其范围从大西洋到太平洋 全球性地扩大。
"By the same token, Entropica  is broadly applicable to problems  in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.",同样的，Entropica 可以广泛地适用于 自主防御、 物流和运输地应用。
"Finally, here we see Entropica  spontaneously discovering and executing  a buy-low, sell-high strategy  on a simulated range traded stock,  successfully growing assets under management  exponentially.",最后，在这里我们看到 Entropica 自主地发现和执行 一个低买高卖的策略， 这是在模拟的范围交易股票上， 它成功地将其管理的资产 成指数升涨。
This risk management ability  will have broad applications in finance  and insurance.,这种风险管理的能力 将在金融和保险领域 有广泛的应用。
"Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen  is that a variety of signature human intelligent  cognitive behaviors  such as tool use and walking upright  and social cooperation  all follow from a single equation,  which drives a system  to maximize its future freedom of action.",阿历克斯•维斯纳-格罗斯： 你刚看到的 是各种具有代表性的人类智能 的认知行为， 例如工具的使用、直立行走 和社会合作， 它们都遵循一个公式， 该公式所驱动的系统 是要将其未来的行动自由最大化。
"Now, there's a profound irony here.",现在，这里存在一个深刻的讽刺。
"Going back to the beginning  of the usage of the term robot,  the play ""RUR,""  there was always a concept  that if we developed machine intelligence,  there would be a cybernetic revolt.","回到最初， 机器人这个术语的用法， ""RUR，""这出戏， 总存在一种概念就是 如果我们开发了机器智能 就会产生一个人工智能的叛变。"
The machines would rise up against us.,机器会奋起反抗我们。
"One major consequence of this work  is that maybe all of these decades,  we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt  in reverse.",这项工作的主要成果之一 就是也许这几十年间， 我们对于人工智能的叛变 的整个概念 是颠倒的。
It's not that machines first become intelligent  and then megalomaniacal  and try to take over the world.,机器不是先有了智慧 然后才变得狂妄 并试图接管世界的。
"It's quite the opposite,  that the urge to take control  of all possible futures  is a more fundamental principle  than that of intelligence,  that general intelligence may in fact emerge  directly from this sort of control-grabbing,  rather than vice versa.",其实几乎是相反的， 那种迫切的欲望， 想要控制所有未来的所有可能 是比智能更基本的 一个原则， 综合智能事实上可能是从 这种控制欲中直接产生的， 而不是反之。
Another important consequence is goal seeking.,另一个重要的成果是寻找目标。
"I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals  follow from this sort of framework?",我经常被问道， 寻找目标的能力 怎么会遵循这种框架结构呢？
"And the answer is, the ability to seek goals  will follow directly from this  in the following sense:  just like you would travel through a tunnel,  a bottleneck in your future path space,  in order to achieve many other  diverse objectives later on,  or just like you would invest  in a financial security,  reducing your short-term liquidity  in order to increase your wealth over the long term,  goal seeking emerges directly",答案是，寻找目标的能力 将直接遵循它， 道理是这样的： 就像你要穿过一条隧道， 你未来道路空间中的一个瓶颈， 为了在以后实现许多 其他的各种目标， 或者就像你会投资 于金融证券， 减少你的短期流动性 从而长远的增加你的财富， 目标的寻求直接涌现于
from a long-term drive  to increase future freedom of action.,长期的驱动， 为了增加未来的行动自由。
"Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,  once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed  and you could pass only a single concept  on to our descendants  to help them rebuild civilization,  that concept should be  that all matter around us  is made out of tiny elements  that attract each other when they're far apart  but repel each other when they're close together.",最后，理查德 · 费曼， 这位著名的物理学家， 曾经写道， 如果人类文明被摧毁 并且你只能将一个概念 传承给我们的后代， 来帮助他们重建文明， 这个概念应该是 我们身边的一切物质 都是由微小的元素组成的， 它们之间距离远的时候 会相互吸引， 但在靠的很近时 它们会互相排斥。
"My equivalent of that statement  to pass on to descendants  to help them build artificial intelligences  or to help them understand human intelligence,  is the following:  Intelligence should be viewed  as a physical process  that tries to maximize future freedom of action  and avoid constraints in its own future.",我与这句话等同的声明， 来传递给后代， 帮助他们建立人工智能 或是帮助他们理解 人类的智慧， 是如下的话： 智能应该被看作是 一个物理过程， 它试图将未来的行动自由最大化 并且避免在自己的未来中的约束。
Thank you very much.,非常感谢。
