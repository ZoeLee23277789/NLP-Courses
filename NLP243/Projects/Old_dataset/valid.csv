Spatial reasoning is deeply connected  to how we understand a lot of the world around us.,理解物体的空??构非常有助于 我??很多周?事物的??。
"So, as a computer scientist  inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --  along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --  I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,  instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip  moving around a flat desktop,  what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,",因此，作?一??算机?域的科?家， 在?种手?思考方式的??下， 以及在我的??Pattie和我的合作伙伴Jeevan Kalanithi的?助下， 我?始思考--要是我?能用一种新型?算机 ?代替鼠?移?光?，就好比一种?字化的手指尖 在桌面移?--那??如何呢？ 要是我?能用手?直接感知信息，
arranging it the way we wanted?,按我?的思路??合信息--那??如何呢？
"This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,  by building Siftables.",??的疑?不???在我的?海中，于是我??定去探?答案， 所以才有了?款Siftables。
"In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer  the size of a cookie.",??地?，Siftable是一款互??算机， 体?如?干般大小。
"They're able to be moved around by hand,  they can sense each other, they can sense their motion,  and they have a screen and a wireless radio.",Siftables可以用手?意移?， 每?Siftable可以互相感知彼此的移?， 每?Siftable?有?示屏和????置。
"Most importantly, they're physical,  so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.",最重要的是，每?Siftable都是?立的， 就像?木一?，可以?意搭配。
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem  of tools for manipulating digital information.,而且Siftables代表了一种新的生?系? --即?字化信息的操作工具。
"And as these tools become more physical,  more aware of their motion, aware of each other,  and aware of the nuance of how we move them,  we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.",?种操作工具更加?立， 更加?敏，能彼此感知， 感知任何?微的移?， 所以我?可以使用?种工具??一些新的有趣的互?。
"So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.",?在，我就?演示一些??的。
"This Siftable is configured to show video,  and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;  if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.",??Siftable有映像配置， 如果我把它向一??斜，那么它所?示的?面也朝???斜， 如果我把它朝反方向?斜，那么?像也朝反方向?斜。
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.,而且?些Siftables能互相感知。
"So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.",如果把它?一?挨一??好，有趣的?象就??生。
"If they get surrounded, they notice that too,  they might get a little flustered.",如果把它??意一堆，他?也?察?到， 那就?有?儿混?。
And they can also sense their motion and tilt.,它??能感知彼此的移?和?斜。
"One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,  was that we could use everyday gestures on data,  like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.",我???一?有趣的互?-- 我?可以通?一些常用的手?和Siftables?行互?， 比如象倒液体那?把?色?一?Siftable倒入另一?Siftable.
"So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets  and I can use them to pour color into that central one,  where they get mixed.","我??看??演示，?有三??置成油漆桶模式的Siftables, 我?可以把?些桶里的?色倒入中?的那?， 把?色混在一起."
"If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.",如果倒多了，可以再倒回去一些。
"There are also some neat possibilities for education,  like language, math and logic games  where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,  and view the results immediately.",Siftables?有??机的功能， 可以用???言、算算?等-- 我?希望通??些功能????得快捷， 更快看到?果。
So here I'm --    This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.,?也是我??里展示Siftables的原因--  ?是我用一???方程式做成的斐波那契?列。
Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.,Siftables?可以玩拼字游?--一种Scrabble和Boggle混搭的拼字游?。
"Basically, in every round  you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,  and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.","?种拼字游?的玩法大致如下， 你?意拿一??有字母的Siftable, ?你把几??有字母的Siftables拼在一起?成???，Siftables?在字典里自?查找??。"
"Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,  and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.",大?30秒后Siftables?自?根据正确的??拼??序改?原??示的字母，?成正确的??， 你?可以??用其他的字母拼出新的??。
Thank you.,??大家。
"So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,  and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.",?在，屏幕上?示的是一些孩子正在Media Lab 里?与Siftables的?用体?， 我把孩子?的体??程拍了下?。
They really loved it.,孩子?非常喜?Siftables。
"And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application  is that you don't have to give people many instructions.",而且有趣的是在玩??拼字游?的?候 我?并不需要向他?解?什么。
"All you have to say is, ""Make words,""  and they know exactly what to do.",只要跟他???是?“拼字”游??， 他?就知道?怎么做了。
So here's another few people trying it out.,?在屏幕上?示的是另一些人在体?Siftables。
"That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.",右下角?位是年?最小的体?者。
"Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.",他只是想把Siftables堆在一起。
"So to him, they were just blocks.",在他看?，Siftables只是?木。
"Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.",?在屏幕上?示的是一种??功能的互???。
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.,我?希望Siftables能成????言的?手。
"And this is Felix, actually.",?面上的??孩子叫Felix。
"And he can bring new characters into the scene,  just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.",他能把一些新元素添加到???像上， 他所做的就是把桌上的Siftables拿起?朝????像投一下影，就可以把?些新元素加到??上了。

"So you see elements here of stabilized slide-show or panoramic imaging,  and these things have all been related spatially.",因此你可以看到?里的元素是?定的幻?放映或者全景成像， 而?些?容在空?上都是??的。
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments.,我不确定我?是否有???展示更多的?境全景。
Some are much more spatial.,有很多例子比??的空?感?要?。

"What makes ayahuasca fascinating  is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,  but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:  on the one hand, this woody liana  which has in it a series of beta-carbolines,  harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic --  to take the vine alone  is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke  drift across your consciousness --  but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family",死藤水的奇妙之? 不在于它神奇的?用性 而在于它的加工方法 ??上它由?种物??成 一方面 它是一种藤本植物 含有 β-?? 蓬? 和微量的致幻成份 就拿它的藤?? 你似乎可以看到 一??色的?? 它与一种名?九?木的咖啡?灌木的枝?

"In fact, I used to argue with my professor, Richard Evan Shultes --  who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era  with his discovery of the magic mushrooms  in Mexico in the 1930s --  I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines  as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects  there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination.

"And the result is -- we call it ""patient autonomy,""  which makes it sound like a good thing,  but it really is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility  for decision-making from somebody who knows something --  namely, the doctor --  to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick  and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions --  namely, the patient.",其?果就是我?所?的“病人自治。” 听起?好像挺不?的。 其?是把做?定的?子和?任 ?一?知道?怎么做的人 我指的是?生， ?嫁到一??治?方案一?所知， 而且正在?病痛所困扰， 根本不在能做?定的??的人身上， 那人就是病人。

"One effect, paradoxically,  is that it produces paralysis, rather than liberation.",其一，?起?有些自相矛盾， 就是，（??）?我???的不是解放， 而是束?，是麻痹。
"With so many options to choose from,  people find it very difficult to choose at all.",面??么?多的?? 人???要做出?定非常困?。
I'll give you one very dramatic example of this:  a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans.,?我?你??非常生?的例子??明??， ?是一??于?等退休金 ?划投?方面做的?查。
"A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard,  the gigantic mutual-fund company  of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.","我的一?同事有幸接触到 Vanguard的投???。 Vanguard是一家巨大的互助基金公司， ?有?百万?工和2,000多??公地?。"
"And what she found  is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered,  rate of participation went down two percent.",她的?查??是 ??些客? 提供的互助基金种?每增加10? ?加的人?就?少2?百分?。
You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate  than if you only offer five. Why?,你提供50种基金，雇??加的 人?比你提供5种基金? 下降百分之十。?什么呢？
"Because with 50 funds to choose from,  it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose,  that you'll just put it off until tomorrow.",因?面?50种基金??? 想要?定?那种那?直是?上加? 所以你干脆放到明天再?。
"And then tomorrow,  and tomorrow, and tomorrow,  and of course tomorrow never comes.",明日复明日， 明日何其多， ?然，明天永?也不?到?。
"Understand that not only does this mean  that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire  because they don't have enough money put away,  it also means that making the decision is so hard  that they pass up significant matching money from the employer.",我?知道?其?意味? ?人?退休?，可能只有用狗?充?， 因?他??有划出足?的????， 同?，由于做?定是一件如此之?的事， 以至于?雇主?他?的那?相? 可?的?等?助金都白白放?了。
"By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year  from the employer, who would happily match their contribution.",不?加?种?等?划，他?每年?多? 5千元的雇主?等???手?溜掉。 雇主本?是很?于提供?种??的。
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.,所以，??可能性?多的?果是麻痹僵化。
And I think it makes the world look like this.,它使得我?的世界?成???子
"You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right?",?你?入极?世界?， 你一定希望你做出的?定是正确的，是?？
"You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund, or the wrong salad dressing.",在那里你一定不想再??互助基金， 或者是沙拉?料。
"So that's one effect. The second effect  is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice,  we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice  than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.",?才那是第一?影?。 再???第二?。 即使我?通?努力克服了僵化和 麻痹而?于做出了一?正确的?定， 我??自己的做出的?定 反而不如可?性少?做出的?定更加?意。
And there are several reasons for this.,?里有几?原因。
"One of them is that with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from,  if you buy one, and it's not perfect -- and what salad dressing is? --  it's easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better.",其中之一是，面?如此多的沙拉?料品种， 如果你?了一种，?得不?如人意， 你很容易去想象如果你挑另外一种就好了。
"And what happens  is this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made,  and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get out of the decision you made,  even if it was a good decision.",?果怎么?？ ?种想象中的另外??引得你? 你已?做出的?定感到后悔， ?种后悔心情?你?你原先做出的 ??的?意度打了折扣， 即便那其?是?很不?的??。
"The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all  that is disappointing about the option that you chose.",??越多，就越容易莫名其妙地 ?一些事感到后悔。 ?就是其一，?是不?意自己做出的 ???定。
"Second, what economists call ""opportunity costs.""",其二，是???家?之?“机?成本”的?西。
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning  of talking about how much the way in which we value things  depends on what we compare them to.,今天早些?候丹。吉?伯特?了?大道理 就是，我?看一??西的价值 取?于那些我?用?作比?的那些其他的?西。
"Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider,  it is easy to imagine the attractive features  of alternatives that you reject  that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen.",嗯，?人?有很多??可以考??， 就很容易去想象那些你放?了的??的 吸引人的方面。 ?就使得你?是?你?中了的那??得美中不足。

"And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea  that he is missing the opportunity, day after day, to have a great parking space.",?果整整??星期他都被?么?想法折磨?， 天天都在念叨失去了占到那? 好停?位的机?。
"Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction we get out of what we choose,  even when what we choose is terrific.",“机?成本”?是?我??已?做出的 ?定不??意 哪怕???定??上很英明。
"And the more options there are to consider,  the more attractive features of these options  are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.",我?面?的??越多 ?些??里吸引人的?西也就越多， ?些?西最后都成了机?成本。
Here's another example.   Now this cartoon makes a lot of points.,?又是一?例子。 ?幅漫??明了好几???。
"It makes points about living in the moment as well,  and probably about doing things slowly.",它也?出了“活在?下”??道理。 也??包括做事情要一步一步?。
"But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing,  you're choosing not to do other things  that may have lots of attractive features,  and it's going to make what you're doing less attractive.",但是，其中一?道理就是，?你??了做某件事， 你同?就??了不做其它的事。 ?些其它的事往往?有很多吸引你的地方， 并且?削弱你正在做的事?你的吸引力。

"The reason I felt worse is that,  with all of these options available,  my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.",?我感?更糟糕的理由就是， 由于有了?么多的可?性， 我?于一?牛仔?到底?有多好 才算好的期望值大大升高。

"And so I compared what I got to what I expected,  and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected.",所以我拿我已有的去和我期望的?行比?， 和我期望的比起?， 我??就?得令人失望了。

Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.,搞市?的人?有人懂得??道理。
"Because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.",因?如果他?里面有人懂的?， 你也就不?有机?知道?是什么意思了
