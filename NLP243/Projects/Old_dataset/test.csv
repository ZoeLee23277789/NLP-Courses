"Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman  introduced a design challenge  called the marshmallow challenge.",几年前，在TED大?上， Peter Skillman 介?了一???挑? 叫做“棉花糖挑?”
"And the idea's pretty simple:  Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure  out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,  one yard of tape, one yard of string  and a marshmallow.",是?非常??的主意 要求一?四人的??搭建一??立的最高建筑 材料是20根意大利面? 一段??，一段?子 一?棉花糖
The marshmallow has to be on top.,棉花糖必?放在最上面
"And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard  because it forces people  to collaborate very quickly.",??然看似??，其?并不容易 因?它要求人? 迅速地合作
"And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,  and I incorporated it into a design workshop.",我?得?是?有趣的主意 我把它放到了???????上
And it was a huge success.,?果非常成功
"And since then, I've conducted  about 70 design workshops across the world  with students and designers and architects,  even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,  and there's something about this exercise  that reveals very deep lessons  about the nature of collaboration,  and I'd like to share some of them with you.",?那以后， 我在全球 70多???????活?中 ??生?和??者，建筑? 甚至?富50?的首席技?官 ????在很多方面?了我? 深刻的?迪 教?我?合作的特性 在?里我跟你?分享一些
"So, normally, most people begin  by orienting themselves to the task.",通常， 人??是? ???始?手完成??任?
"They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,  they jockey for power.",他???一?， 勾勒出?果?是什么?子 他?互相??一番??
"Then they spend some time planning, organizing,  they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.",然后花?????划，?? 他??一下??然后拿出意大利面?
They spend the majority of their time  assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.,他?用了大量的?? 把意大利面???得越?越高
"And then finally, just as they're running out of time,  someone takes out the marshmallow,  and then they gingerly put it on top,  and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --  they admire their work.",然后最后，??快要用完了 他?拿出棉花糖 小心翼翼地?棉花糖放到最上面 然后他?后退一步，哈哈 他?欣??他?的成果
"But what really happens, most of the time,  is that the ""ta-da"" turns into an ""uh-oh,""  because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure  to buckle and to collapse.",但是?大多??候，真正?生的是 “哈哈” ?成了“糟了” 因?棉花糖的重量把整??构 ??散架了
"So there are a number of people  who have a lot more ""uh-oh"" moments than others,  and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.",有那么一些人 他?的“糟了”?刻比其他人多 其中最糟的是新??的商?院?生
"They lie, they cheat, they get distracted  and they produce really lame structures.",他???，他?欺?，很容易受干扰 他?的建筑构造非常蹩?
"And of course there are teams  that have a lot more ""ta-da"" structures,  and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.",?然也有一些?? 他??造了更多的“哈哈”?刻 其中最好的，就是新??的幼儿?小朋友
And it's pretty amazing.,??真是很神奇
"As Peter tells us,  not only do they produce the tallest structures,  but they're the most interesting structures of them all.",正如PETER告?我?的 他?不但造出了最高的建筑 而且他?搭建的?构也是最有趣的
So the question you want to ask is:  How come? Why? What is it about them?,所以你?? ?是怎么回事？他?到底有什么特?？
"And Peter likes to say that  none of the kids spend any time  trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?",Peter喜????： “因??有任何孩子企?做 意大利面?公司的?裁。” 是的
They don't spend time jockeying for power.,他??在???力上花任何??
But there's another reason as well.,但是其中?有另一?原因
"And the reason is that business students are trained  to find the single right plan, right?",因?商?院的?生受?的????是 去?找一?正确的?划
And then they execute on it.,然后他?按照?划?行
"And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,  they run out of time and what happens?",然而事?是， ?他?把棉花糖放到?部? 他?用完了有限的??，然后呢
It's a crisis.,危机就降?了
Sound familiar? Right.,听?很熟悉吧？是的。
"What kindergarteners do differently  is that they start with the marshmallow,  and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,  always keeping the marshmallow on top,  so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.",幼儿?的孩子的做法不一? 他??棉花糖?始 他?先建一??板模型， 然后不?在模型上加建， 其??是?棉花糖保持在最上面 所以他?一直有很多机?去不?修正?板模型
Designers recognize this type of collaboration  as the essence of the iterative process.,于是??者??到?种合作是 ??互??程中的重要因素
"And with each version, kids get instant feedback  about what works and what doesn't work.",?每?版本，孩子都?迅速地得到反? 他?知道什么行，什么不行
"So the capacity to play in prototype is really essential,  but let's look at how different teams perform.",所以把握?形的能力是真正的?? ?我??看看不同的?伍是怎?表?的

Who does the very best?,?做得最好呢？
"Architects and engineers, thankfully.",建筑?和工程?，?天?地。
Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.,我??的最高的塔是39英寸
And why is it? Because they understand triangles  and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns  are the key to building  stable structures.,?什么呢？因?他?懂得三角形 和自我?固的几何模式 是建筑 ?定?构的??
"So CEOs, a little bit better than average,  but here's where it gets interesting.",?裁?比平均水平稍好一些 但是有趣的是
"If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,  they get significantly better.",如果你在他?的小?里加一?行政助理 他?的成??上?得好很多
"It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, ""Oh, that team's going to win.""",?真是令人?以置信， 你四?看看， 你?：“那?小???。”
You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?,你很早就知道， ?什么呢？

And any team who manages  and pays close attention to work  will significantly improve the team's performance.,?之，任何一?小??极管理并 ?注于工作本身的? 小?的表?就有?著的提高

"If you have 10 teams that typically perform,  you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.",如果你有10???加??活? 其中大概有6??可以搭建可以直立的?构
And I tried something interesting.,我做了一?有趣的??
"I thought, let's up the ante, once.",我想， 我?不妨??一次
"So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.",所以我就提供了价值10万美元的?件?得胜的小?
So what do you think happened to these design students?,你猜猜那些???的?生??有什么?的反?？
What was the result?,?果如何？
Here's what happened:  Not one team had a standing structure.,?就是?果 ?有一?小?完成了一?站立的建筑
"If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,  they would have taken home the prize.",哪怕任何一?小?完成一?一英寸的建筑 他?就可以把?杯捧回去
"So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes  have a strong impact.",所以，很有意思的是 高??金?有很大的影?。
We did the exercise again with the same students.,之后我?在同?的?生中又重复了??活?
What do you think happened then?,你猜猜?果怎?？
So now they understand the value of prototyping.,?回他?知道了做?版模型的价值
So the same team went from being the very worst  to being among the very best.,所以最差的那?小? 成?了最好的小?
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.,他?用最少的??完成了最高的建筑
So there's deep lessons for us  about the nature of incentives and success.,?些?我?都有很深的教育意? 揭示了??和成功的本?
"So, you might ask: Why would anyone  actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?",所以，你也???：怎么?有人 花????么一?棉花糖的挑?
"And the reason is, I help create  digital tools and processes  to help teams build cars and video games  and visual effects.",原因是我可以用 ?子工具和流程 ??助人?造汽?，?子游? 和模???效果
And what the marshmallow challenge does  is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.,而棉花糖的挑?教?我? ???藏?的一些假?

"And then there is a remembering self,  and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,  and maintains the story of our life,  and it's the one that the doctor approaches  in asking the question,  ""How have you been feeling lately?""",另一?自我?是??自我， 他????生活， 抒?生活故事， ?生要找他? ??么?， “最近感?如何？”
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.,或“去阿?巴尼?好玩么？”等?似的??。
"Those are two very different entities,  the experiencing self and the remembering self,  and getting confused between them is part of the mess  about the notion of happiness.",??自我和??自我 是截然不同的， ?者的混淆是?致我?不懂快?的 部分原因。
"Now, the remembering self  is a storyteller.",??自我 ???述故事。
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --  it starts immediately.,故事???中直接?取-- 即?上?。
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.,并不是我?在?我?要?的故事。
"Our memory tells us stories,  that is, what we get to keep from our experiences  is a story.",是我?的??在?故事， 它是我????中?存下?的 故事。
And let me begin with one example.,?我用一?例子?始。
This is an old study.,?是一?古老的研究。
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.,一些真正的病人??接受一种痛苦的治?方法。
"I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,  but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.",??不再?述。?今的?法已不再如此?受， 但在研究?行的九十年代?，?种方法令人痛不欲生。
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.,病人每隔六十秒?必??告他?的痛苦指?。
"Here are two patients,  those are their recordings.",??有?位病患。 ?是他?的??。
"And you are asked, ""Who of them suffered more?""",我?你：“在他?之中?最痛苦？”
And it's a very easy question.,????很??。
"Clearly, Patient B suffered more --  his colonoscopy was longer,  and every minute of pain that Patient A had,  Patient B had, and more.",?然，是病人B。 他的????查????， 病人A每分?感?的痛疼 病人B也感?到了，而且持?更久。
But now there is another question:  "How much did these patients think they suffered?",但?在?有另一???： ?些患者??他?受罪了?？
And here is a surprise.,?里有?小意外：
The surprise is that Patient A  had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy  than Patient B.,令人惊?的是病人A ?????查的??比病人B ?糟糕。
"The stories of the colonoscopies were different,  and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.",?段????查的故事不同， ???在于故事的?尾--
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --  but one of them is this distinct ...   but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.,??故事都不怎么?迪智慧-- 但?者?然是不同的... ?然其中之一的感受比另一??差。
And the one that is worse  is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;  it's a bad story.,感??糟的?一? 是在最后的?期里知?什么是痛?人寰。 ?不是?好故事。
How do we know that?,我?是怎么知道的？
"Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,  and much later, too,  ""How bad was the whole thing, in total?""",因?我?在?查?束后?他?， 以及在很久之后再?一次他?， “你??????查的整体印象如何？”
"And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.",?果是A的??感?明?要比B更糟糕。
Now this is a direct conflict between the experiencing self and the remembering self.,?在?是??自我和??自我
"From the point of view of the experiencing self,  clearly, B had a worse time.",之?的直接?突。 ???自我的角度?看， 病人B?然是比??受的。
"Now, what you could do with Patient A,  and we actually ran clinical experiments,  and it has been done, and it does work --  you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A  by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.",那么病人A的情??如何解?， 我???做了一??床??， ???完成?，我?也得到了?期的?果， 事?上我?可以延?病人A的?查?? ?而???管的震?程度。
"That will cause the patient  to suffer, but just a little  and much less than before.",?然病人?是?疼， 但已?? ?多了。
"And if you do that for a couple of minutes,  you have made the experiencing self  of Patient A worse off,  and you have the remembering self of Patient A  a lot better off,  because now you have endowed Patient A  with a better story  about his experience.",假如????下去， 你??使病人A的??自我的 感?更糟， 但病人A的??自我 ??感?好多了， 因?你?了病人A 一?好一?的故事， 一?好一???他病痛??的故事。
What defines a story?,怎??故事定?好坏？
"And that is true of the stories  that memory delivers for us,  and it's also true of the stories that we make up.",并且??告?我?的故事 是真?的， 我??述的故事也是真的。
"What defines a story are changes,  significant moments and endings.",故事的好坏取?于高潮?分 及?尾?刻。
"Endings are very, very important  and, in this case, the ending dominated.",?尾是非常重要的， 上面的??故事就是由?尾所主?的。
"Now, the experiencing self  lives its life continuously.",?在，??自我 延???生活??。
"It has moments of experience, one after the other.",他也?有片刻的??，一?接一?。
And you can ask: What happens to these moments?,你??：“?些片刻怎么了？”
And the answer is really straightforward:  They are lost forever.,答案很??。 他?永?消失了。
"I mean, most of the moments of our life --  and I calculated, you know, the psychological present  is said to be about three seconds long;  that means that, you know,  in a life there are about 600 million of them;  in a month, there are about 600,000 --  most of them don't leave a trace.",我?生活中的大多片刻-- 我算了算--?心理?角度?? ??只是三秒?。 ?意味? 人一生中大?有六??片刻。 一?月里?大?有六十万?片刻。 它?大多不留痕?。
Most of them are completely ignored  by the remembering self.,大多?皆被??自我 全然忽?了。
"And yet, somehow you get the sense  that they should count,  that what happens during these moments of experience  is our life.",然而，你?在亦??? 一些感?被?存， 因?我???中的每分每秒合在一起 就构成了我?的人生。
"It's the finite resource that we're spending  And how to spend it  would seem to be relevant,  but that is not the story  that the remembering self keeps for us.",只要我?活?， 我?就?消耗?些有限的?源。 ?如何使用它?， 似乎是很重要的， 但?不是??自我 所留?我?的故事。
"So we have the remembering self  and the experiencing self,  and they're really quite distinct.",因此??自我 和??自我 是很好??的。
The biggest difference between them  is in the handling of time.,他?之?的最大不同 是在于?理??的方式。
"From the point of view of the experiencing self,  if you have a vacation,  and the second week is just as good as the first,  then the two-week vacation  is twice as good as the one-week vacation.",就??自我而言， 如果你有一?假期， 第二周和第一周同等快?， 那么?周下? 快?的分量是一周假期的?倍多。
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.,然而??自我?不是??算的。
"For the remembering self, a two-week vacation  is barely better than the one-week vacation  because there are no new memories added.",???自我??，?周假期 并不比一周假期多多少， 因?期??有任何新??的加入。
You have not changed the story.,故事的?情依然如?。
"And in this way,  time is actually the critical variable  that distinguishes a remembering self  from an experiencing self;  time has very little impact on the story.",因此 ??是?分 ??自我和??自我的 ??因素。 ?????故事的影?不大。
"Now, the remembering self does more  than remember and tell stories.",??自我所做的 不?是??和?述故事。
"It is actually the one that makes decisions  because, if you have a patient who has had, say,  two colonoscopies with two different surgeons  and is deciding which of them to choose,  then the one that chooses  is the one that has the memory that is less bad,  and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.",它也是真正做?定的因素， 因?，假若你的病人已?? ??位不同的外科?生?做胃???查， 而?在?定?他?中?一位?再做?查?， 病人?的??是 ??中感?比?好的那位， ?就是如何?定?生的。
The experiencing self  has no voice in this choice.,??自我 在做??是???置喙。
"We actually don't choose between experiences,  we choose between memories of experiences.",事?上，我?不?在?段??中做??。 我?是在?种不同??的??中做出??。
"And even when we think about the future,  we don't think of our future normally as experiences.",而且?我??想未??， 一般我?不?以??的形式去思考。
We think of our future  as anticipated memories.,我?把未? 以?想的??形式呈?。
"And basically you can look at this,  you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,  and you can think of the remembering self  sort of dragging the experiencing self  through experiences that  the experiencing self doesn't need.",大体上你可以看到， ??自我是?制的， 你可以想象??自我 在拽???自我， 他是通???自我不要的?? ?拽???自我的。
"I have that sense that  when we go on vacations  this is very frequently the case;  that is, we go on vacations,  to a very large extent,  in the service of our remembering self.",我有?想法， ?我?放假? 往往 之所以放假， 有很大一部分 是?了??自我。
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.,我想?有?????。
"I mean, how much do we consume our memories?",我?使用了多少的??？
That is one of the explanations  that is given for the dominance  of the remembering self.,?可以解? ??自我 ?何能成?主?的自我。
"And when I think about that, I think about a vacation  we had in Antarctica a few years ago,  which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,  and I think of it relatively often,  relative to how much I think of other vacations.",??我想起一次假期， 几年前在南极度?的假期， ?可以?是我最棒的一?假期， 与其它假期相比， 我常常?想起??假期。
"And I probably have consumed  my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,  for about 25 minutes in the last four years.",?趟旅程大概?我用掉了 三周的??量， 大概?在?去四年中占了?25分?。
"Now, if I had ever opened the folder  with the 600 pictures in it,  I would have spent another hour.",?在，如我打??料? 里面大概有600?相片， 我可能要花一?小??回?。
"Now, that is three weeks,  and that is at most an hour and a half.",三周的旅程 最多只用一?半小??回?。
There seems to be a discrepancy.,?似乎不成比例啊。
"Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,  in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,  but even if you do more of this,  there is a genuine question:  Why do we put so much weight on memory  relative to the weight that we put on experiences?",??我有?不?， 因?我?得真是太少了， 不?就算你?得再多 ?里也?有???的??。 ?什么我?用??? 比依????多？
So I want you to think  about a thought experiment.,所以我希望你能思考 一?有?思考的??。
"Imagine that for your next vacation,  you know that at the end of the vacation  all your pictures will be destroyed,  and you'll get an amnesic drug  so that you won't remember anything.",假使你的下一?假期， ?你知道假期?束后 假期中所有的相片?被???， 而你也?吞下一??忘? 以使你?忘一切。
"Now, would you choose the same vacation?   And if you would choose a different vacation,  there is a conflict between your two selves,  and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,  and it's actually not at all obvious, because  if you think in terms of time,  then you get one answer,  and if you think in terms of memories,  you might get another answer.",??，你??想?同?的假期么？ 如果你?了?不同的假期， 你的??自我之????生?突， 你得想法?裁????突， ?并不怎么容易， 因?假若你?考??? 你?得到一?答案。 但若?考??? 你?得到另外一?答案。
Why do we pick the vacations we do  is a problem that confronts us  with a choice between the two selves.,我??什么要?此而非彼， ??困扰我?的?? 是需要在??自我之?作出??。
"Now, the two selves  bring up two notions of happiness.",?在，??自我 ???快?的?种不同?解。
"There are really two concepts of happiness  that we can apply, one per self.",??种?快?的?解 分???了??自我。
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?,因此你??：“??自我是有多快?？”
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments  in the experiencing self's life?,接?你??：“??自我的每一刻 有多快?？”
And they're all -- happiness for moments  is a fairly complicated process.,?些快??刻的?成?程 是异常复?的。
What are the emotions that can be measured?,情感?如何?量？
"And, by the way, now we are capable  of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.",??一提，我??在 ?于??自我?????而感受快? 已?有了一?粗?的概念了。
"If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,  it's a completely different thing.",而??自我所指的快? ?是完全??事。
This is not about how happily a person lives.,?并不是一?人生活多快?的??。
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is  when that person thinks about her life.,而是它?自己的人生 有多?意和多喜?的??。
Very different notion.,迥然不同的?解。
"Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions  is going to mess up the study of happiness,  and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,  who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time  in precisely this way.",若不能分辨??种?解 就?法?透快?????， 我和其他活得好的?生一?， 一直以?都研究不透快?， 就是因???原因。
"The distinction between the  happiness of the experiencing self  and the satisfaction of the remembering self  has been recognized in recent years,  and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.",近年?， ??自我的快? 和??自我的?足的 差异性已能分清， 目前正努力?分??度?者，
"The Gallup Organization has a world poll  where more than half a million people  have been asked questions  about what they think of their life  and about their experiences,  and there have been other efforts along those lines.",?洛普公司最近在全世界?行了一?民意?查， 其中逾五十万人 都被?及一??似的??， 那就是他?如何看待他?的生活 和如何看待他?的??。 除了????，??公司?做了其它的?查。
"So in recent years, we have begun to learn  about the happiness of the two selves.",近年?，我?逐?得知 ?于?种快??解的信息。
And the main lesson I think that we have learned  is they are really different.,我??我?主要?到的便是 ?者是天壤之?的。
"You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,  and that really doesn't teach you much  about how happily they're living their life,  and vice versa.",?然你可以得知一?人?生活是否?意， 但??法告?你 他?平常活的有多快?， 而反之亦然。
"Just to give you a sense of the correlation,  the correlation is about .5.",只是?了?你?其中的??性有?基本概念， 它?之?大概只有50%??。
"What that means is if you met somebody,  and you were told, ""Oh his father is six feet tall,""  how much would you know about his height?",意思是?你?到某?人?， 你被告知他的爸爸有六尺高， 你能知道??人有多高么？
"Well, you would know something about his height,  but there's a lot of uncertainty.",好吧，你可能有?基本概念， 但非常不确定。
You have that much uncertainty.,你?法下判定。
"If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,  you have a lot of uncertainty  about how happy they are  with their experiencing self.",若我?有人?自己的生活?量打分，他打8/10分， 你也不能把握 他?的??自我 有多么快?。
So the correlation is low.,所以??性很低。
We know something about what controls  satisfaction of the happiness self.,我?知道什么能? ?人的快?得到?足。
"We know that money is very important,  goals are very important.",我?知道?是很重要的， 目?也非常重要。
"We know that happiness is mainly  being satisfied with people that we like,  spending time with people that we like.",我?知道要快?是需要通? 我?所喜?的人??足， 是需要花??和他?待在一起??足。
"There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.",?然?有其它因素，但?是主要因素。
"So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,  you are going to end up  doing very different things.",所以假若你想???自我都快?， 你必????? 且要做些与?不同的事。
The bottom line of what I've said here  is that we really should not think of happiness  as a substitute for well-being.,我?的是，我?至少 不?把快??成活得好的 代名?。
It is a completely different notion.,??者是天壤之?的。
"Now, very quickly,  another reason we cannot think straight about happiness  is that we do not attend to the same things  when we think about life, and we actually live.",?在，很快地??下 另一?我?不能理解快?本?的原因， 那就是我?怎么看生活 和我?怎么?生活是不一?的。
"So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,  you are not going to get to the correct answer.",所以，?你?加州的人有多快??， 你??法得到正确答案。
"When you ask that question,  you think people must be happier in California  if, say, you live in Ohio.",因??你????， 你??加州人一定?得比?快?， 而你?住在俄亥俄州。
"And what happens is  when you think about living in California,  you are thinking of the contrast  between California and other places,  and that contrast, say, is in climate.",?你在想 住在加州有多快??， 你?想到加州和其他州域 之?的差异性， 譬如，气候。
"Well, it turns out that climate  is not very important to the experiencing self  and it's not even very important to the reflective self  that decides how happy people are.",事??明气候?件 ?于??自我并非很重要 而且?于思考自我 衡量自己有多快?也不太重要。
"But now, because the reflective self is in charge,  you may end up -- some people may end up  moving to California.",不?，既然??由思考自我主?， 一些人可能?得到??一种??， 那就是搬到加州。
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen  to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.,他?搬去加州是?了?上更快?的生活， 是而追??看他?的后??展，??是一件相?有趣的事。
"Well, their experiencing self  is not going to get happier.",他?的??自我 是不??得更快?。
We know that.,?我?都知道。
"But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,  because, when they think about it,  they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,  and they will feel they made the right decision.",不??一件事?生后，他???得自己快?多了。 因?在他?思考?， 他??回想起俄亥俄州的坏天气。 他?也因此?得他?做出了正确的?定。
"to think straight about well-being,  and I hope I have given you a sense  of how difficult it is.",要理解快?生活 ?在很?， 我希望我已??你??此有?基本概念， 并且明白???程到底有多?。
Thank you.,??。
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I've got a question for you.,克里斯·安德森：??您的演?。我有???想?教您。
Thank you so much.,非常感?您的演?。
"Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,  you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result  came out of that Gallup survey.",几星期前，我?有?一次??通?， ??您提到您??洛普的?查中 ??了一?有趣的?象。
Is that something you can share  since you do have a few moments left now?,??您可以跟我?分享一下?？ 我??有几分?的??。
Daniel Kahneman: Sure.,丹尼?·卡?曼：???。
"I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey  is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.",我??洛普?查中??了一?极有趣的?字， 能??它??意外。
We found that with respect to the happiness  of the experiencing self.,我???一??于 ??自我的快?的?象。
"When we looked at how feelings,  vary with income.",那就是人的感? ??收入的多少而?化。
"And it turns out that, below an income  of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --  and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,  so it's a large representative sample --  below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...",?果表明，?于年收入低于六万美元的 美?人而言， ?占了?本中的很大一部分， ?近有六十万人，?些人是相?具有指?性的， ?些年收入低于六十万美元......
"CA: 60,000.",安德森：是六万美元。
"DK: 60,000.",卡?曼：六万美元。
"60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,  and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.",年收入六万美元的人是不快?的， 而且收入越低，他??逾不快?。
"Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.",而?收入逾六万?，我??得到一??准水平?。
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.,?得看到?么平坦的?。
"Clearly, what is happening is  money does not buy you experiential happiness,  but lack of money certainly buys you misery,  and we can measure that misery  very, very clearly.",?然 金?是?法?到??自我的快?， 但???的确能?你??悲郁的境?， 而且我?清楚地?到痛苦的程度， 非常清楚。
"In terms of the other self, the remembering self,  you get a different story.",?于另一?自我，??自我而言。 你?有了一?大相?庭的故事。
"The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.",你?的越多，你就越?意。
That does not hold for emotions.,?跟情感?有任何??。
"CA: But Danny, the whole American endeavor is about  life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.",安德森：可是丹尼，生命、自由和追求快? 是所有美?人?斗的目?。
"If people took seriously that finding,  I mean, it seems to turn upside down  everything we believe about, like for example,  taxation policy and so forth.",假若大家都?真?待?一??， 那么，???覆我? 固有的?念，例如， ??政策等。
"Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,  would take a finding like that seriously  and run public policy based on it?",???家的政治人物有?有可能 ?正???的?? 并且依次施政？
DK: You know I think that there is recognition  of the role of happiness research in public policy.,卡?曼：我??已有人?知到研究快? 于?划政策中的地位。
"The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,  no question about that,  but in the U.K., it is happening,  and in other countries it is happening.",但???知于美?的?播速度?慢， ?是毋庸置疑的， 但在英?，它正持??酵， 其他?家亦然。
People are recognizing that they ought  to be thinking of happiness  when they think of public policy.,一般人也?始?知到 在?划政策? 亦??快??入考量指?。
"It's going to take a while,  and people are going to debate  whether they want to study experience happiness,  or whether they want to study life evaluation,  so we need to have that debate fairly soon.",?然??花些??， 但人?也??始思考。 他?要的是??的快? 抑或是?生活打分， 因此很快，我??要理解????。
"How to enhance happiness  goes very different ways depending on how you think,  and whether you think of the remembering self  or you think of the experiencing self.",如何增?快?， 有好几种方式，但事?你是怎么想的， 你想的是??自我 ?是在想??自我。
"This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.",我想于几年之?，??影?政策的?施。
"In the United States, efforts are being made  to measure the experience happiness of the population.",美?已?付出巨大的努力?衡量 大?的??的快?。
"This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,  part of national statistics.",我想在十年或二十年?， ???成??家???据的一部分。
"CA: Well, it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be --  the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years.",安德森：?????于我?? ??是未?几年里 最有的一?政策????。

I'm going to talk today about energy and climate.,我今天要?的是能源与气候，?可能有?出人意料

"And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision  and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl  shaped my own view of myself  as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.",今天，我常常在思考，P?生?年的?野 以及他?我的“??的小姑娘”?一?? ?我自我?知的影?有多么大 ?如今，我已?能??到我的?在是??有力的，我的未?一片光明
This is an example of how adults in positions of power  can ignite the power of a child.,P?生的??例子就很好的?明了 一位?有力量的成年人能??燃一?孩子的?能

"The human ability to adapt, it's an interesting thing,  because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,  and I'm going to make an admission:  This phrase never sat right with me,  and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,  and I think I'm starting to figure out why.",?起人?适??境?一本?，我感?很有意思 因?人??常想?我就“克服逆境”?一???一? 今天我想做一??明 “克服逆境”?一??我??根本不成立 ?人?我就?一???几句的?候，我很不自在 我?始思考?什么???
"Implicit in this phrase of ""overcoming adversity""  is the idea that success, or happiness,  is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience  unscathed or unmarked by the experience,  as if my successes in life have come about from an ability  to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,  or what other people perceive as my disability.",“克服逆境”???有一??含的意思 那就是成功，或者快? 都在一段??的??的另一端 而?段??本身?与成功和快??? 就好像是?，我?一生之所以能成功 是因?我??了作?一?截肢人所要面?的一系列挑? ??在?人看?制?我的一些因素
"But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,  whether physically, emotionally or both.",但??上，?些挑???在在地改?了我?，在我?的人生旅程中烙下了印? ?种改?可能是身体上的，可能是精神上的，也可能?者兼具
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.,我想?的是，面?挑?不失?一件好事
Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around  in order to resume living our life.,面?逆境，我?不?把它?成障???它 ?而??我?的生活
It's part of our life.,其?，逆境是我?生活的一部分
And I tend to think of it like my shadow.,我把逆境想象成我自己的影子
"Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,  but it's always with me.",有的?候它看起?很大，有的?候很小 但是它始?在我身?
"And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.",?然，我不是???低人?与逆境作斗?的价值和意?
"There is adversity and challenge in life,  and it's all very real and relative to every single person,  but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,  but how you're going to meet it.",我?在一生中注定要??逆境与挑? 我?每?人都是 但是我?所?注的??并不是你是否要去面?逆境 而是如何去面?它
"So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,  but preparing them to meet it well.",所以，我?的?任不是????地?我??心的人生活在?床里 而是?他?能?形成?容??逆境的能力
And we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.,?我??孩子??得自己?有适??境的能力?
There's an important difference and distinction  between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee  and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.,我???上?害了他? ???的角度客?地判?我是否是一??疾人 ?社?的角度主?地去考?我是否是一?“?疾人” 此?者?有很大的差?
"And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront  is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.",??上，我自始至?所要面?的唯一的一??? 是??世界?我的种种不公的看法和描述
"In our desire to protect those we care about  by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,  or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,  we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall  that will actually disable someone.",我?希望能?保?那些我?在意的人? 我?把冷冰冰的?????告告?他? 或者有?候，?他?未?的生活??做?? 但是我?一定要注意我?的所做所? 是否?摧??些人? 也?，人???了只?注于自己的种种缺陷 并想?如何修复?些缺陷
"Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself.",?种思?定式??疾人的?害比?疾人本身的生理缺陷更?重
"By not treating the wholeness of a person,  by not acknowledging their potency,  we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.",我?不?一?整体的角度看待?疾人 不去承?他?的能力 ??他?本身就很??的?境?疑是雪上加霜
We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.,我?能有效地?一?人?其所在社?的的价值?行?估
So we need to see through the pathology  and into the range of human capability.,因此，我?的目光不??局限在?疾人生理上的缺陷 而是??注意到他?作?人的价值
"And, most importantly, there's a partnership  between those perceived deficiencies  and our greatest creative ability.",另外，最重要的一? ?疾人的一些缺陷和人?的?造力之? 是存在??系的
"So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times  as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,  but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.",所以，?辛的?斗?月是不?被?低、否定的 ?不是什么我?要避免或者掩?的事 恰恰相反，我???在逆境中?找机遇
"So maybe the idea I want to put out there is  not so much overcoming adversity  as it is opening ourselves up to it,  embracing it,  grappling with it,  to use a wrestling term,  maybe even dancing with it.",其?，我想?明的道理就是 逆境，不是用?"克服"的 我???坦然面?它 ?抱它 与它摔打 我?才用了一?摔角的??（摔打） 甚至，与它舞蹈
"And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,  we're less burdened by the presence of it.",也?，如果我?能把逆境看成是自然的、不??的、?人有用的?西 它的存在?我???也不再是??了
"This year we celebrate the 200th birthday of Charles Darwin,  and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,  that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.",今年我??祝了??文的200周年?辰 ???文在150年前?物种?化?的?候 他?明了一??于人?特征的真理
"To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,  nor is it the most intelligent that survives;  it is the one that is most adaptable to change.",他?的那句?大概意思就是，能生存下?的物种 往往不是最??的，也不是最?明的 而是最能适?外部?境?化的
Conflict is the genesis of creation.,矛盾?突是?造之母
"From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that  the human ability to survive and flourish  is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict  into transformation.",??文等?位大?的著作都揭示了?一? 人?生存繁衍的能力 源自人??魂??激烈斗?后的?? 就是??

I don't think so.,我想不?吧

"It is not a death when they melt;  it is not an end,  but a continuation  of their path through the cycle of life.",?它?融化?，??不是死亡； 也?不是一???， 而是 通往生生不息之路的一?延?。
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young --  a couple thousand years old.,我拍??的冰山，有些冰是非常年?-- 几千年年?。
"And some of the ice  is over 100,000 years old.",有些冰 超?十万年。
"The last pictures I'd like to show you  are of an iceberg that I photographed  in Qeqetarsuaq, Greenland.",我想?大家展示的最后?片 是我在格陵??的 Kekertsuatsiak上拍?的一?冰山。
It's a very rare occasion  that you get to actually witness  an iceberg rolling.,?是一?非常?得的机? 大家??上得以?? 一?冰山翻?。
So here it is.,所以?就如?所示。
You can see on the left side a small boat.,在左?你能看到一?小船。
That's about a 15-foot boat.,?是一??15英尺的船。
And I'd like you to pay attention  to the shape of the iceberg  and where it is at the waterline.,我想?你注意 冰山的形? 它在水面上的?形。
"You can see here, it begins to roll,  and the boat has moved to the other side, and the man is standing there.",在?儿你看到它?始翻?， 小船移?到另一?，一?男人站在那里。
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg.,?是一?平均尺寸的格陵?冰山。
"It's about 120 feet above the water,  or 40 meters.",它浮出水面大?有120英尺高 或者40米高。
And this video is real time.,???是??拍?的。
"And just like that,  the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality.",就像?冰山， 它?展示?大家的是其?性的不同方面。
Thank you.,??。
"I want you to imagine two couples  in the middle of 1979  on the exact same day, at the exact same moment,  each conceiving a baby -- okay?",我希望大家?想一下， ??夫? 在1979年的年中 在相同的一天，相同的?刻 每?怀上了一?孩子 -- 好
So two couples each conceiving one baby.,那么??夫?各自都都怀上了一?孩子
"Now I don't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception,  because if you spend all that time imagining that conception,  you're not going to listen to me.",?在，我不希望大家花太多的??去想象怀孕 因?如果你花太多??去想它 你就不?听我?了
So just imagine that for a moment.,所以稍微想一下就好了
"And in this scenario,  I want to imagine that, in one case,  the sperm is carrying a Y chromosome,  meeting that X chromosome of the egg.",那么在?种情?下 我??想一下，一??例是 ???Y染色体的精子 遇到???X染色体的卵子
"And in the other case,  the sperm is carrying an X chromosome,  meeting the X chromosome of the egg.",另一?是 ???X染色体的精子 遇到???X染色体的卵子
Both are viable; both take off.,??都存活下?了，??都?始?育
We'll come back to these people later.,我?之后再?看???夫?
So I wear two hats  in most of what I do.,我?任??角色 在我所?事的?域
"As the one hat,  I do history of anatomy.",一?角色是 我做解剖??史研究
"I'm a historian by training,  and what I study in that case  is the way that people have dealt with anatomy --  meaning human bodies, animal bodies --  how they dealt with bodily fluids, concepts of bodies;  how have they thought about bodies.",我是?史?工作者 我所研究的是 人?是怎么?待解剖?的—— ???是人??体，或是?物?体—— 他?如何?理体液，抽象的?体 他?是如何看待?体的
"The other hat that I've worn in my work  is as an activist,  as a patient advocate --  or, as I sometimes say, as an impatient advocate --  for people who are patients of doctors.",另一?角色是 一名社?活?家 作?一??病人??人的角色—— 或者?，像我有?候?的，作??生?的病人的??人—— 我是很激?的
"In that case, what I've worked with  is people who have body types  that challenge social norms.",那?的?，在我工作中 所接触到的是一些 挑??社??范的人
"So some of what I've worked on, for example,  is people who are conjoined twins --  two people within one body.",比如，我接触到的一些人 是?体?儿 ??人共用一?身体
Some of what I've worked on is people who have dwarfism --  so people who are much shorter than typical.,?有一些是侏儒症患者 他?比一般人要矮小的多
And a lot of what I've worked on  is people who have atypical sex --  so people who don't have the standard male  or the standard female body types.,另外，?多我接触的人 他?的性?与?不同 -- 即他??有很?准的男性特征 或者女性特有的身体特征
"And as a general term, we can use the term intersex for this.",?的??，??症?可以被叫做?性人
Intersex comes in a lot of different forms.,?性可以有多种的形式
I'll just give you a few examples  of the types of ways you can have sex  that isn't standard for male or female.,我??几?例子 ??明你可以具有 既不是?准的男性特征也不是?准的女性特征的?型
"So in one instance,  you can have somebody who has an XY chromosomal basis,  and that SRY gene on the Y chromosome  tells the proto-gonads, which we all have in the fetal life,  to become testes.",例子之一 一?人可以?有XY染色体 并且，在Y染色体上的SRY基因 刺激我?在胎儿?期都有的原始性腺 使其?成睾丸
And so in the fetal life the testes are pumping out testosterone.,因此在胎儿?期，睾丸分泌睾丸激素
"But because this individual lacks receptors  to hear that testosterone,  the body doesn't react to the testosterone.",但是???体缺少受体 ?接收睾丸激素 身体不能?睾丸激素做出反?
And this is a syndrome called androgen insensitivity syndrome.,?是一种叫做睾丸不敏感?合征
"So lots of levels of testosterone, but no reaction to it.",所以，睾丸激素的量很大，但是不能引起反?
"As a consequence, the body develops  more along the female typical path.",因此，身体就?朝? 女性化的???展
"When the child is born, she looks like a girl.",??儿?生?，她看起?像?女孩儿
She is a girl. She is raised as a girl.,她就是女孩儿，并且被?作小姑娘???
"And it's often not until she hits puberty  and she's growing and developing breasts,  but she's not getting her period,  that somebody figures out something's up here.",大多?情?，直到青春期 她的胸部?始?育的?候 她??有女性周期 ??我?才??始怀疑有什么差?
"And they do some tests and figure out  that, instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus,  she actually has testes inside, and she has a Y chromosome.",于是他??查?? 她并?有卵巢和子? ??上，在她身体?有睾丸，并且她???Y染色体
"Now what's important to understand  is you may think of this person as really being male,  but they're really not.",?在，有一?重要??需要?明的是 大家一定????人??上是?男孩儿 其?并非如此
"Females, like males,  have in our bodies something called the adrenal glands.",女性，和男性一? 体?有一?器官叫做?上腺
They're in the back of our body.,它在我?身体的后端
"And the adrenal glands make androgens,  which are a masculinizing hormone.",并且?上腺??分泌雄性激素 即一种雄性荷?蒙
Most females like me -- I believe myself to be a typical female --  I don't actually know my chromosomal make-up  but I think I'm probably typical --  most females like me are actually androgen-sensitive.,像我一?的大多?女性--我相信我自己是?典型的女性-- 我其?不太清楚我的染色体的?成 但是我想我??是有典型的女性—— 大多?像我一?的女性??上是雄激素敏感的
"We're making androgen, and we're responding to androgens.",我?分泌雄性激素，并且?它有反?
The consequence is that somebody like me  has actually had a brain exposed to more androgens  than the woman born with testes  who has androgen insensitivity syndrome.,?果是，有的像我一?女性， 大?暴露在?多的雄性激素下 比那?出生?有睾丸的女孩 那?雄性激素不敏感?合征的女孩有的雄性激素?多
"So sex is really complicated; it's not just that intersex people  are in the middle of all the sex spectrum --  in some ways, they can be all over the place.",所以?性?是?非常复?的?西；并不是?那些?性的人 就?在男性和女性之?—— 在某些方面，他?可以覆?整?性特征的范?
"Another example:  a few years ago I got a call from a man who was 19 years old,  who was born a boy, raised a boy,  had a girlfriend, had sex with his girlfriend,  had a life as a guy  and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside.",?有一?例子 几年前，我接到一?十九?的男孩打?的?? 他生下?是?男孩，也被?作男孩?? 后?有了女朋友，也和女友?生了性?系 一直??男孩的生活 但是最近，他??自己体?有卵巢和子?
What he had was an extreme form  of a condition called congenital adrenal hyperplasia.,他所有的是一种很极端的病症 叫做?固醇21-?化?缺乏症
"He had XX chromosomes,  and in the womb,  his adrenal glands were in such high gear  that it created, essentially, a masculine hormonal environment.",他??XX染色体 并且在子??的?候 他的?上腺很活? ?而形成了一?男性荷?蒙的?境
"And as a consequence, his genitals were masculinzed,  his brain was subject  to the more typical masculine component of hormones.",?果就是，他?育了男性生殖器官 他的大?接受了 更多的典型的男性荷?蒙
And he was born looking like a boy -- nobody suspected anything.,因此他生下?看起?像?男孩儿--根本?人怀疑
"And it was only when he had reached the age of 19  that he began to have enough medical problems  actually from menstruating internally,  that doctors figured out that, in fact, he was female internally.",只有?他?到19?的?候 ?他?始遇到生理??的?候 其?是在体?出?月?起 ?生??，??上他的?部是女性
"Okay, so just one more quick example  of a way you can have intersex.",好，我?再?快速的看一?例子 另一?可能???性特征的情?
"Some people who have XX chromosomes  develop what are called ovotestis,  which is when you have ovarian tissue  with testicular tissue wrapped around it.",有XX染色体的一些人 ??育一种叫做卵睾的器官 也就是?卵巢?? 被睾丸??包裹起?的一种器官
And we're not exactly sure why that happens.,我??不能确定它的成因
So sex can come in lots of different varieties.,所以?性?可以是很多种形式
"The reason  that children with these kinds of bodies --  whether it's dwarfism, or it's conjoined twinning,  or it's an intersex type --  are often normalized by surgeons  is not because it actually leaves them better off  in terms of physical health.",?有?些身体特征的 孩子?—— 不?是侏儒症，或者?体?儿 或者是?性型的—— 常被外科?生手??正的原因 ??上并不是?了 身体健康
"In many cases, people are actually perfectly healthy.",因?很多情?下，他?的身体其?都很健康
The reason they're often subject to various kinds of surgeries  is because they threaten our social categories.,他?接受各种外科手?的原因 是因?他?受到我?社?上?人分?的威?
Or system has been based typically on the idea  that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity.,或者?社?上已?有一?典型的?? 什么?的身体?构，有什么?的特征
"So we have the concept that what it means to be a woman  is to have a female identity;  what it means to be a black person is, allegedly,  is to have an African anatomy  in terms of your history.",因此，我?的概念就是作?一?女人 就必?有女性的特性 以此?推，一?黑人 就得具有非洲人的身体?构特征 在你的履?中
And so we have this terribly simplistic idea.,因此我?就有了?种?于??的??
"And when we're faced with a body  that actually presents us something quite different,  it startles us in terms of those categorizations.",?我?面?一? 某些方面是与?不同的身体的?候 那些不能??的想法?我?感到吃惊
So we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture  about individualism.,因此我?的文化中有很多天真的想法 是?于?人主?的
And our nation's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism.,并且我??家建立在一?非常不??的?人主?的概念上的
Well you can imagine how startling then it is  when you have children that are born  who are two people inside of one body.,好，你可以想象那多么令人震惊 ?你的??孩子 出生的?候是在一?身体中的
"Where I ran into the most heat from this most recently  was last year the South African runner, Caster Semenya,  had her sex called into question at the International Games in Berlin.",我最近一次遇到?种情?是 去年的?候，非洲田????，卡斯特?·塞?? 在柏林??比?中被?疑性???
"I had a lot of journalists calling me, asking me,  ""Which is the test they're going to run  that will tell us whether or not  Caster Semenya is male or female?""",?多?者?我打??，?我 “他??用哪种??方法 ?向大家?明 卡斯特?·塞??是男?是女？”
And I had to explain to the journalists there isn't such a test.,于是我不得不跟他?解??，根本?有??的方法
"In fact, we now know  that sex is complicated enough  that we have to admit  nature doesn't draw the line for us between male and female,  or between male and intersex and female and intersex;  we actually draw that line on nature.",事?上，我??在已?了解 性?是非常复?的 我?不得不承? 大自然根本就?有一?明确的分界???分男性或女性 或者男性和?性以及女性和?性 ??分界???上是我?自己?的
"So what we have is a sort of situation  where the farther our science goes,  the more we have to admit to ourselves  that these categories  that we thought of as stable anatomical categories  that mapped very simply  to stable identity categories  are a lot more fuzzy than we thought.",因此我??在的情?是 科?越?展 我?越得承? ?些性?的分?形式 也就是我???很理所?然的身体?构?上的分? 是?于??地 ?特性分了? ??情?要比我?想象的模糊的多
And it's not just in terms of sex.,并且?不??是?于性?的??
"It's also in terms of race,  which turns out to be vastly more complicated  than our terminology has allowed.",也同?是?于种族的?? ??复?程度 ?不是我?的???言所能形容的
"As we look, we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas.",如我?所?，我?涉及各种各???的?域
"We look, for example, about the fact  that we share at least 95 percent of our DNA  with chimpanzees.",我??看一?例子，??情?是 我?用95%的人?的DNA 与大猩猩?行?比
What are we to make of the fact  that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides?,得出的事?是 人?和大猩猩的DNA只是在一些核?酸上有所不同
"And as we get farther and farther with our science,  we get more and more into a discomforted zone  where we have to acknowledge  that the simplistic categories we've had  are probably overly simplistic.",科技越?展 我?越?涉及到?人苦?的?域 我?必?承? 那些沿用的??的分? 是?于??化了
So we're seeing this  in all sorts of places in human life.,正因如此，我?正在??? 人?生活中的各??域
"One of the places we're seeing it, for example,  in our culture today, in the United States today,  is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life.",其中的一??域，??例子 就是我?的文化?域，?今美?的文化?域 ???生命的起源和??
"We have difficult conversations  about at what point we decide a body becomes a human,  such that it has a different right than a fetal life.",我?有一???的?? ?于我?什么?候?一??体?成了一?人? ?而有了不同于胎儿的?利
We have very difficult conversations nowadays --  probably not out in the open as much as within medicine --  about the question of when somebody's dead.,我??今有一?非常有??的??—— 也?在外部不如在??界???的激烈—— 是?于何??定?人死亡的疑? ?去，人死的?候
"In the past, our ancestors never had to struggle so much  At most, they'd stick a feather on somebody's nose,  and if it twitched, they didn't bury them yet.",我?的祖先??不??多的??于此 最多也就是把一?羽毛粘在人的鼻子下 如果羽毛?了，旁人就不?把他?埋掉
"If it stopped twitching, you bury them.",如果羽毛不?，就?埋了他?
"But today, we have a situation  where we want to take vital organs out of beings  and give them to other beings.",但是如今的情?都是 我?希望把死者的器官 移植到其他人的身体上
"And as a consequence,  we're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question  about who's dead,  and this leads us to a really difficult situation  where we don't have such simple categories as we've had before.",?果 我??始??在上面所提到的??中 ?于到底死了?有 ??致我??入一?很困?的情? ??情??有之前??的分?了
Now you might think that all this breaking-down of categories  would make somebody like me really happy.,?在你也??想，所有的?些正在崩?的分? 也???像我??的人感到高?
"I'm a political progressive, I defend people with unusual bodies,  but I have to admit to you that it makes me nervous.",我是一?在政治??上不??步的人，我??那些身体异于常人的人 但是我必?承?，?种改??我感到不安
Understanding that these categories  are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense.,??到?些分?制度 比我?想象的?不?定，使我感到??
And it makes me tense  from the point of view of thinking about democracy.,同?，我的???自于 民主的??
"So in order to tell you about that tension,  I have to first admit to you that I'm a huge fan of the Founding Fathers.",所以，?了告?大家?种??的程度 我首先要承?，我是?父?的忠?粉?
"I know they were racists, I know they were sexist,  but they were great.",我知道他?是种族主?者，他?是男性至上主?者 但是他?非常?大
"I mean, they were so brave and so bold  and so radical in what they did  that I find myself watching that cheesy musical ""1776"" every few years,  and it's not because of the music, which is totally forgettable.",我的意思是，他?是如此的英勇、?畏 并且?极的?事他?的事? 我自己每隔几年就要重新去欣?那?挺土的音??“1776”（美?建?史的音??） 并不是因?音?好，音?是完全可以被忽略的
It's because of what happened in 1776  with the Founding Fathers.,是因?1776年??? 建?者??生的事情
"The Founding Fathers were, for my point of view,  the original anatomical activists,  and this is why.",建?者?，我??他?是 最早的解剖?活?家 ?是我?他?的原因
What they rejected was an anatomical concept  and replaced it with another one  that was radical and beautiful and held us for 200 years.,他?反?了一?解剖?的概念 并且用另一?取而代之 ??新?的美好的概念保持了200年
"So as you all recall,  what our Founding Fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy,  and the monarchy was basically based  on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.",大家回?一下 我?的建?者?反?的是一?君主制度的概念 并且??君主制是基于 ?于??化的解剖?概念上的
"The monarchs of the old world  didn't have a concept of DNA,  but they did have a concept of birthright.",?体制下的帝王? ?有DNA的概念 但是他?遵?的是“出身”的理念
They had a concept of blue blood.,他?有?族的概念
They had the idea that the people who would be in political power  should be in political power  because of the blood being passed down  from grandfather to father to son and so forth.,他???，身在政治?力下的人 就??掌握?力 是因??族血?要 ?祖父到父?到儿子一代代?承
"The Founding Fathers rejected that idea,  and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept,  and that concept  was all men are created equal.",建?者?反??种?? 他?用一种新的解剖上的概念取而代之 那种概念就是 人人平等
"They leveled that playing field  and decided the anatomy that mattered  was the commonality of anatomy,  not the difference in anatomy,  and that was a really radical thing to do.",他?消除了等??念 并且确定解剖?的重要性 在于全民平等 而不是出身的?? 在??那确?是一?很激?的改革
Now they were doing it in part  because they were part of an Enlightenment system  where two things were growing up together.,某种程度上，?种改革?在仍然在?行 因?他?是?蒙??系?的一部分 ?件事情是共同?展的
"And that was democracy growing up,  but it was also science growing up at the same time.",民主制度在??正在形成 但同?科技也在?展
"And it's really clear, if you look at the history of the Founding Fathers,  a lot of them were very interested in science,  and they were interested in a concept  of a naturalistic world.",非常明?的是，如果你注意一下建?者的?史 他?中的?多人都?科?很感?趣 并且他?都?自然主?世界??概念 很感?趣
"They were moving away from supernatural explanations,  and they were rejecting things like a supernatural concept of power,  where it transmitted  because of a very vague concept of birthright.",他?摒?超自然的?法 他?排斥那些?于超自然力量的?法 因?超自然力量的概念被?播 是基于非常模糊的身世的理念
They were moving towards a naturalistic concept.,他?倡?自然主?的概念
"And if you look, for example, in the Declaration of Independence,  they talk about nature and nature's God.",如果你?察???，例如在?立宣言中 他?提及到自然和自然之神
They don't talk about God and God's nature.,他??有提到上帝和上帝的自然
They're talking about the power of nature  to tell us who we are.,他?提到自然的力量 ?解?我?是?
"So as part of that,  they were coming to us with a concept  that was about anatomical commonality.",因此作?其中的一部分 他??我???一?概念 那就是人人生?平等
"And in doing so, they were really setting up in a beautiful way  the Civil Rights movement of the future.",?此 他?确????的民??? ??了一?很美好的道路
"They didn't think of it that way, but they did it for us, and it was great.",他?想不到???怎?，但是他??我?奠定了基?，?是非常?大的
So what happened years afterward?,那么?年后?生了什么呢？
"What happened was women, for example,  who wanted the right to vote,  took the Founding Fathers' concept  of anatomical commonality being more important  than anatomical difference  and said, ""The fact that we have a uterus and ovaries  is not significant enough in terms of a difference  to mean that we shouldn't have the right to vote,  the right to full citizenship,  the right to own property, etc., etc.""",例如在女性身上都?生了什么 她?渴望投票的?利 按照建?者的概念 人人平等要?重要于 人的出身 她??：“我?有子?和卵巢是事? ?些不同完全不足以 意味?我??有投票? ?有充分的公民?利 ?有私人???等等”
And women successfully argued that.,女性的主??得了成效
"Next came the successful Civil Rights movement,  where we found people like Sojourner Truth  talking about, ""Ain't I a woman?""",接下?便是成功的民??? ??中出?了像索杰?·特?思??的人 她的名言“我就不是女人?？”
"We find men  on the marching lines of the Civil Rights movement  saying, ""I am a man.""",我?知道男人 曾?在民???的?展路?上 有句名言“我是?男人”
"Again, people of color  appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy,  again, successfully.",此外，有色人群 呼吁人人平等而不?种族歧? 再者，
We see the same thing with the disability rights movement.,我?看到同?的成功案例?生在??人士的?利??中
"The problem is, of course,  that, as we begin to look at all that commonality,  we have to begin to question  why we maintain certain divisions.",??是，?然 ?我??始去??所有的公民 我?不得不?始?疑 ?什么我?去??一?固定的界限
"Now mind you, I want to maintain some divisions,  anatomically, in our culture.",?在，需要提醒大家的是，我希望去保持一些界限 身体?构上的，在我?的文化范?被?
"For example, I don't want  to give a fish the same rights as a human.",??例子，我不希望 ?予?和人?一?的?利
I don't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy.,我不希望我?放?一切在解剖?上的?分界限
I don't want to say five-year-olds  should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry.,我不希望，一?五?的孩子 可以被允?有性行?或者?允??婚
So there are some anatomical divisions  that make sense to me and that I think we should retain.,所以?，有一些在解剖?上的界限 ?我???是有意?的，我想那些??被保留
But the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are  and why do we retain them and do they have meaning.,但是，?巨的任?是??去找出哪些是??保留的 ?什么我?要保留它?，它?有什么意?
So let's go back to those two beings  conceived at the beginning of this talk.,所以，?我?回到?才?到的那?人 就是演?一?始所?构的那??人
"We have two beings, both conceived  in the middle of 1979 on the exact same day.",我?有??夫? 都在1979年年中的同一天怀孕了
"Let's imagine one of them, Mary,  is born three months prematurely,  so she's born on June 1, 1980.",?我??想一下，?? 提前三?月出生了 因此她出生于1980年6月1日
"Henry, by contrast, is born at term,  so he's born on March 1, 1980.",亨利，相反的，足月出生 他出生于1980年3月1日
"Simply by virtue of the fact  that Mary was born prematurely three months,  she comes into all sorts of rights  three months earlier than Henry does --  the right to consent to sex,  the right to vote, the right to drink.",??是由于 ??早出生了三?月??事? 她?得各种?利的?? 要比亨利早三?月 允?有性行?的?利 ??的?利，喝酒的?利
"Henry has to wait for all of that,  not because he's actually any different in age, biologically,  except in terms of when he was born.",亨利就不得不等待 他的生理?年??有任何不同 只是因?他出生的??不同
We find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are.,我????其他一些离奇的?利??
"Henry, by virtue of being assumed to be male --  although I haven't told you that he's the XY one --  by virtue of being assumed to be male  is now liable to be drafted,  which Mary does not need to worry about.",亨利，由于被假定?男性-- ?管我?有告??大家他是XY型染色体—— 由于被假定?男性 所以?在要?征入伍 ??就不需要去?心?些
"Mary, meanwhile, cannot in all the states  have the same right that Henry has in all the states,  namely, the right to marry.",与此同?，??不能在所有的州 像亨利一?享受同??利 也就是，?婚的?利
"Henry can marry in every state a woman,  but Mary can only marry today in a few states a woman.",亨利可以在任何一?州?婚 但是??如今只能在少?几?州娶一位女性
So we have these anatomical categories that persist  that are in many ways problematic and questionable.,因此我?所?持的一些?构上的生物分? 它?在很多方面是有??并且需要?疑的
"And the question to me becomes:  What do we do,  as our science gets to be so good  in looking at anatomy,  that we reach the point where we have to admit  that a democracy that's been based on anatomy  might start falling apart?",?我??，??就?成了： 我?要做什么 ?我?的科?在解剖?上 如此先?的?候 我?已?到了不得不承? 基于解剖?上的人的民主 也?正在崩?的?候
"I don't want to give up the science,  but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes  like the science is coming out from under us.",我不想?科?失去希望 但是同?，有的?候???得 科?的?展是受到我?影?的
So where do we go?,因此我??走向何方？
"It seems like what happens in our culture  is a sort of pragmatic attitude:  ""Well, we have to draw the line somewhere,  so we will draw the line somewhere.""",看起?我?的社? 有?一种?用主?的?度： “好，我必?在某??一?界限， 那么我就在那?一?界限”
But a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position.,但是很多人?因此陷在一?非常?尬的位置
"So for example,  Texas has at one point decided  that what it means to marry a man  is to mean that you don't have a Y chromosome,  and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a Y chromosome.",??例子 德克?斯州有一??定 嫁?一?男人 意味?你?有Y染色体 同?如果你娶一?女人意味?你有Y染色体
Now in practice they don't actually test people for their chromosomes.,??中，他???上不?去??染色体

So obviously this is not all going to fit  back in my tiny suitcase.,?然?衣服都不??? 我的小旅行箱。
"So before I go home to Brooklyn,  I'm going to donate everything back.",所以在我回布?克林之前， 我?把一切都捐回。
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week  is that it's okay to let go.,因???星期我在教自己 放手是可以的。
"I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things  because around the corner,  there is always going to be  another crazy, colorful,  shiny outfit  just waiting for me,  if I put a little love in my heart and look.",我不需要??西眷?， 因?在下一?角落， 永??有 又一套?狂的，色彩?? ???光的衣服 在等我， 只要我???去?找。
Thank you very much.,非常感?。
Thank you.,??。
"This is a representation of your brain,  and your brain can be broken into two parts.",?是大?的描??。 你的大?可以被分???部分。
"There's the left half, which is the logical side,  and then the right half,  which is the intuitive.",左?，主要??理性方面， 而右?， 主要??直?。
"And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere,  then we can plot our brain.",如果我?用刻度???量?半球的能力的?， 并??我?的大?。
"And for example, this would be somebody who's completely logical.",比如?，?表示某人完全的理性。
This would be someone who's entirely intuitive.,?就表示?某人完全的感性。
So where would you put your brain on this scale?,那你?把你的大?放在?上的哪里呢？
"Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes,  but I think for most people in the audience,  your brain is something like this --  with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time.",一些人可能???极端情?的一种， 但是我?得大多?听?， 你的大?位置??大致像??-- ???半球同?有?很高的?力。
It's not like they're mutually exclusive or anything.,它?不太可能?互相的排斥或其他什么的。
You can be logical and intuitive.,你可以既理性又感性。
"And so I consider myself one of these people,  along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists,  who need a good deal of logic  to string together these complex ideas.",我自??是一? 和大多?其他的??量子物理?家一?， 有?很好的??思? 能把那些复?的想法串?起?。
"But at the same time, we need a good deal of intuition  to actually make the experiments work.",但是同?，我?也需要一?好的直? ???能切?的?行下去。
How do we develop this intuition? Well we like to play with stuff.,那我?如何?提高?种直?力呢？嗯我?喜?研究?西。
"So we go out and play with it, and then we see how it acts,  and then we develop our intuition from there.",我?本身研究和?鼓?西，然后我??看它怎么反?。 接?我??中提升我?的直?力。
And really you do the same thing.,??上你也做同?的事情。
So some intuition  that you may have developed over the years  is that one thing is only in one place at a time.,有一些你可能 培?了很多年了的直? 像一?事物只能同?出?在一?方位。
"I mean, it can sound weird to think about  one thing being in two different places at the same time,  but you weren't born with this notion, you developed it.",我的意思是，??很奇怪，要你去考?一?事物可以 同?出?在??不同的地方， 但是你不是天生就有?种概念，你是后天培?的。
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop.,我?得看到?一?小孩在阻?器上玩。
"He was just a toddler and he wasn't very good at it, and he kept falling over.",他?只是??步而且并不擅???的小孩，他就一直摔倒。
"But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson,  and that's that large things don't let you get right past them,  and that they stay in one place.",但是我打?和阻?器玩耍?他上了很有价值的一?， 就是大型的物体不??你?易的穿?， 而且它?停留在一?地方。
"And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world,  unless you're a particle physicist.",?是世上?有的一?很具?概念性的模型， 除非你是粒子物理?家。
"It'd be a terrible model for a particle physicist,  because they don't play with car stops,  they play with these little weird particles.",?于粒子物理?家?也?是一?很糟糕的模型， 因?他?不研究阻?器， 他?研究那些很小的奇怪的微粒。
"And when they play with their particles,  they find they do all sorts of really weird things --  like they can fly right through walls,  or they can be in two different places at the same time.",?他?研究他?的微粒的?候， 他??得他?在做各种真正奇怪的事情-- 好像他?能穿?， 或者他?能同?出?在??地方。
"And so they wrote down all these observations,  and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics.",他???下?些??的?候， 他?以此起名?量子力?理?。
"And so that's where physics was at a few years ago;  you needed quantum mechanics  to describe little, tiny particles.",?就是几年前物理?的前沿； 你需要量子力? ?描述?小，微小的粒子。
"But you didn't need it  to describe the large, everyday objects around us.",但是你不需要它 ?描述那些巨大的，周?日常的物体。
"This didn't really sit well with my intuition,  and maybe it's just because I don't play with particles very often.",?并不很符合我的直??知， 也?是因?我不太?常研究微粒的?故吧。
"Well, I play with them sometimes,  but not very often.",嗯，我?是有?候研究它?的， 只是不太平常而已。
And I've never seen them.,而且我也???有看到?它?。
"I mean, nobody's ever seen a particle.",我指，?人能看?微粒。
But it didn't sit well with my logical side either.,但是?也不符合我的???知。
"Because if everything is made up of little particles  and all the little particles  follow quantum mechanics,  then shouldn't everything just follow quantum mechanics?",因?如果所有事物都是由微粒?成的 而每?微粒 都遵循量子力?理?的?， 那所有事物不也??遵循量子力?理??？
I don't see any reason why it shouldn't.,我找不到?什么它不遵循的原因。
And so I'd feel a lot better about the whole thing  if we could somehow show  that an everyday object  also follows quantum mechanics.,所以我?于整件事情?了解的更好 如果我?用某种方式?表明 日常的每件事物 也都遵循量子力?理?。
"So a few years ago, I set off to do just that.",不久之前，我?始?手。
So I made one.,我制造出了??。
This is the first object  that you can see  that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition.,?是第一?你能看的? 同?也是 量子力??加的?物。
So what we're looking at here  is a tiny computer chip.,?里我?看到的 是一???微型芯片。
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle.,在中?你大概能看到的那???。
And that's this piece of metal I'm going to be talking about in a minute.,那就是我接下去要?的金?。
This is a photograph of the object.,?是它的照片。
And here I'll zoom in a little bit. We're looking right there in the center.,聚焦一?。我?看到正中心的那?。
"And then here's a really, really big close-up of the little piece of metal.",??是一?很近，很近距离??到的金?片。
"So what we're looking at is a little chunk of metal,  and it's shaped like a diving board, and it's sticking out over a ledge.",我?看到的是一小?金?， 它的外形像一?跳水板，并且它伸出了一端。
And so I made this thing  in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip.,我用几乎和制造??芯片 同?的方法制造出?金?。
"I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer,  and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours.",我在?菌室操作一片硅晶片， 接?我周?于所有?些大型机器中大?100?小?。
"For the last stuff, I had to build my own machine --  to make this swimming pool-shaped hole  underneath the device.",?了最后的?果，我不得不制造自己的机器-- ??泳池型的洞 在??的下方。
"This device has the ability  to be in a quantum superposition,  but it needs a little help to do it.",????有能力 ??行量子?加， 但是它需要些?助?完成?步?。
"Here, let me give you an analogy.",?，?我?你打?比方。
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator?,你知道在一???的?梯里是多么不舒服?？
"I mean, when I'm in an elevator all alone, I do all sorts of weird things,  but then other people get on board  and I stop doing those things  because I don't want to bother them,  or, frankly, scare them.",我指，?我一?人在?梯里，我能做各种奇怪的事情， 但是?其他人??的?候 我就停止做?些事， 因?我不想打扰到其他人， 或者，???，?到其他人。
So quantum mechanics says  that inanimate objects feel the same way.,所以量子力?表明 非生命体也??出同?的情?。
"The fellow passengers for inanimate objects  are not just people,  but it's also the light shining on it  and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room.",那些非生命体的乘客 不??是人， 但是它?包括照射它的光 吹拂?它的?和空??的?度。
"And so we knew, if we wanted to see  this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically,  we're going to have to kick out all the other passengers.",所以，如果我?想目睹 ?片金?表?出量子力?的特性， 我?就不得不剔除所有其他的乘客。
And so that's what we did.,?就是我?曾做的。
"We turned off the lights,  and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air,  and then we cooled it down  to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero.",我????光， 接?我?把它放入抽真空机中并抽出所有的空气， 接?我??它冷? 到??零度以上一??。
"Now, all alone in the elevator,  the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted.",?在，在?梯里， 小金?片可以做任何它想做的事。
And so we measured its motion.,我??量了它的??。
We found it was moving in really weird ways.,我???它用很古怪的方式在??。
"Instead of just sitting perfectly still, it was vibrating,  and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this --  like expanding and contracting bellows.",它是在震?，而不是完全的?止。 它震?的方式是像?种-- 像一?一合的?箱。
"And by giving it a gentle nudge,  we were able to make it both vibrate  and not vibrate  at the same time --  something that's only allowed with quantum mechanics.",只要?它一??微的撞?， 我?就能?它震? 的同? 也不震?-- 某些只在量子力?范?下才??生的事。
So what I'm telling you here is something truly fantastic.,我在?里告?大家的是一些很奇妙的事情。
What does it mean for one thing  to be both vibrating and not vibrating  at the same time?,一?事物震?的 同?也不震? ?是什么意思？
So let's think about the atoms.,?我?考?下原子。
So in one case:  all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal  are sitting still  and at the same time those same atoms  are moving up and down.,一?例子： 所有万??形成金?片的原子 正保持?止 同?同?的?些原子 正在上下移?。
Now it's only at precise times when they align.,只有在特定精确??，它?是一致的。
The rest of the time they're delocalized.,余下的??它??是不定域的。
"That means that every atom  is in two different places at the same time,  which in turn means the entire chunk of metal  is in two different places.",?意味?每?原子 在同一??在??不同的地方， ?一步?明整?金?片 在??位置。
I think this is really cool.,我????真的很酷。
Really.,真的。
"It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years  because, check this out,  the difference in scale  between a single atom and that chunk of metal  between that chunk of metal and you.",我?些年把自己?在?菌室所做的事都是很值得的。 因?，看??， ??原子 和金?片的比例差 大?和整片金?片和你???体的 比例差是一?的。
"So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time,  that chunk of metal can be in two different places,  then why not you?",所以如果??原子能同??于不同的??位置， 那金?片也能?于不同的??位置， 那么?什么你不能呢？
"I mean, this is just my logical side talking.",我指的，?只是我的理性思考的??。
"So imagine if you're in multiple places at the same time,  what would that be like?",那想想如果你能同??于多?位置， 那?是什么?子的？
How would your consciousness  handle your body being delocalized in space?,你的?知?如何?理 你自身在空?中的不定域??呢？
There's one more part to the story.,?是故事的一?部分。
"It's when we warmed it up,  and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box,  we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece.",?我?把它加?， 并打??光?察盒子里面的?候， 我?看到金?片依?只是一?。
"And so I had to develop this new intuition,  that it seems like all the objects in the elevator  are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space.",所以我不得不形成一?新的直?， 似乎所有?梯中的物体 ??上都被塞?一?极小空?中的
You hear a lot of talk  about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected.,量子物体。 大家听?很多 ?于量子物理?如何解?万物是互相?系的。
"Well, that's not quite right.",嗯，?不是完全正确的；
It's more than that; it's deeper.,它要比??更?泛，更深?。
"It's that those connections,  your connections to all the things around you,  literally define who you are,  and that's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics.",正是?些?系， 你和你周?的?些?系， 真正的定?了你是?。 ?才是量子力?的深?和不可思?。
Thank you.,??

"And if the car and the driver were good enough, then you'd win the race.",如果你的?和?手?好的?，那你??冠。
"Now today, if you want to win the race,  actually you need also something like this --  something that monitors the car in real time,  has a few thousand sensors  collecting information from the car,  transmitting this information into the system,  and then processing it  and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions  and changing things in real time  as information is collected.",?如今，如果你想?冠， 事?上你?需要其他一些?西比如??-- 一些能??????的?? 它?接?上千感?器 能把收集到的?的相??据， ???系?中， 并?理 并用???反??定??本身 使其??地改? 做到与信息收集同步。
"This is what, in engineering terms,  you would call a real time control system.",?就是，用工程?的?法， 叫做???控系?。
"And basically, it's a system made of two components --  a sensing and an actuating component.",基本上，??系?包括??部件 一?是感?器一?是??器
What is interesting today  is that real time control systems  are starting to enter into our lives.,如今，有趣的是 ?????控系? 正?始?透到我?的生活中。
"Our cities, over the past few years,  just have been blanketed  with networks, electronics.",我?的城市，在?去的几年中， 已?被网?，?子工? 所覆?。
They're becoming like computers in open air.,它 ??得好像??收放??。
"And, as computers in open air,  they're starting to respond in a different way  to be able to be sensed and to be actuated.",同?，作???收放的??， 它??始做出不同的回? 能?感和制?。
"If we fix cities, actually it's a big deal.",如果我?能优化城市，??上?是???。
"Just as an aside, I wanted to mention,  cities are only two percent of the Earth's crust,  but they are 50 percent of the world's population.",?句?外?，我想?， 城市只占了地球表面的百分之2， 但是它??占据了世界人口的百分之50。
They are 75 percent of the energy consumption --  up to 80 percent of CO2 emissions.,它?的能源消耗占世界的百分之75-- ?生百分之80的二氧化碳排放量。
"So if we're able to do something with cities, that's a big deal.",所以如果我?优化城市，那??是??越。
"Beyond cities,  all of this sensing and actuating  is entering our everyday objects.",在?些城市之上， 所有?些?感和制? 正在?入我?每天的日常事物中。
"That's from an exhibition that Paola Antonelli is organizing  at MoMA later this year, during the summer.",?是今年夏天柏拉·安??利 在???代??博物? ??的一次展?。
It's called "Talk to Me.",主??“与我交?。”
"Well our objects, our environment  is starting to talk back to us.",我?的事物，我?的?境， 正在?始?我?反?。
"In a certain sense, it's almost as if every atom out there  were becoming both a sensor and an actuator.",某种意?上，就像每?原子 都在?成?感器和制?器。
And that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans  with the environment out there.,同??也根本上改?了我?作?人? 和大自然之?的?系。
"In a certain sense,  it's almost as if the old dream of Michelangelo ...",某种意?上， ??直就是米?朗琪?古老的?想...
"you know, when Michelangelo sculpted the Moses,  at the end it said that he took the hammer, threw it at the Moses --  actually you can still see a small chip underneath --  and said, shouted,  ""Perche non parli? Why don't you talk?""",你知道，?米?朗琪?雕刻摩西像?， 在最后他拿起??，扔向摩西像-- 事?上你?看到底下那小的凹槽-- ??，咆哮?， “你?什不??，?什么？”
"Well today, for the first time,  our environment is starting to talk back to us.",今天，第一次， 我?的?境?始?我?反?。
"And I'll show just a few examples --  again, with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it.",我?展示几?案例-- 有一次，??我?的意?去感?并回?我??境。

It was four and a half years ago in Italy.,那是在4年6?月之前的意大利。
"And what we did there  was actually use a new type of network at the time  that had been deployed all across the world --  that's a cellphone network --  and use anonymous and aggregated information from that network,  that's collected anyway by the operator,  in order to understand  how the city works.",我?在那里做的 ??上是用那?的一种新型的网? ?如今已?覆?全球-- 手机网?-- 并通???网?收集任何?端?出的 密名的整合?的信息 ?理解 城市是如何?作的。

"And so we decided that we were going to sponsor  Tony, TEMPT, and his cause.",因此，我??定成? 托尼，也就是TEMPT，事?的?助者。
"So I went and met with his brother and father  and said, ""We're going to give you this money.",因此我去找到他兄弟和他父? ?他??，“我?打算?你?些?。
What are you going to do with it?",你??用?做什么？”
"And his brother said, ""I just want to be able to talk to Tony again.",他兄弟?道，“我只是想能?再和托尼聊天。
I just want to be able to communicate with him  and him to be able to communicate with me.",我只想能跟他交流 而且他也能跟我交流。”
"And I said, ""Wait a second, isn't that -- I've seen Stephen Hawking --  don't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate  via these devices?""",我?道，“等等，我曾??斯蒂芬·霍金，” 不是所有??的人都能通??些?? 和?人交流么？
"And he said, ""No, unless you're in the upper echelon and  you've got really amazing insurance,  you can't actually do that.",他回答道，“不，除非是上?社?的人，” ?有十分惊人的保?， 不然根本做不到。
These devices aren't accessible to people.",?些??不是那么容易得到的。”
"And I said, ""Well, how do you actually communicate?""",我?道，”好的，你?是怎么交流的？“
Has everyone seen the movie "The Diving Bell and the Butterfly?",大家有?有看??影”?水?和蝴蝶“？
That's how they communicate --  so run their finger along.,那就是他?交流的方式 -- 移?他?的手指。
"I said, ""That's archaic. How can that be?""",我?道，”?法子太落后了。怎么???？“

So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that.,几?月之后我在一次??上有?演?。

"First it starts with the sexual organs,  then it starts with cuss words,  then it was Bush slanders  and then people actually got to art.",首先以性器官?始， 然后是??， 接?是??布什 然后人?就看到了??。
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations.,但是他?展示?是?涵了一?生命周期。
"So I went home and was having dinner with my wife  and was telling her about this,  and we were like, ""Well wait a second. If we know that this technology exists  where you can use your eyes to control things,  why don't we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser  and he could do graf again? Well that would be awesome.""",我回到家中，与我妻子共?晚餐? 把?些告?了她， 大意是，”等等，如果我?知道??技? 能?你用眼睛控制事物， ?什么我?不想??法?TEMPT?控制一束激光， ?一他就能再次?行涂?了，那就太棒了。“

The idea behind the Stuxnet computer worm  is actually quite simple.,震网??蠕虫背后的思想 其?非常??。
We don't want Iran to get the bomb.,我?不希望伊朗?有核武器。

"The gray boxes that you see,  these are real-time control systems.",各位看到的灰盒子 是??控制系?。
"Now if we manage to compromise these systems  that control drive speeds and valves,  we can actually cause a lot of problems  with the centrifuge.",如果我??法侵入?些 控制??器的速度和??的系?中， 我???上可以用离心机 造成很多??。
The gray boxes don't run Windows software;  they are a completely different technology.,??灰盒子不能?行Windows?件； 它?用的是完全不同的技?。
"But if we manage  to place a good Windows virus  on a notebook  that is used by a maintenance engineer  to configure this gray box,  then we are in business.",但如果我??法 把一?Windows病毒 放到一名 ??工程?用于配置 ??灰盒子的??本上， 然后我?就可以?始行?了。
And this is the plot behind Stuxnet.,?就是震网病毒背后的??。
So we start with a Windows dropper.,那么我?一?Windows注入器?始。
"The payload goes onto the gray box,  damages the centrifuge,  and the Iranian nuclear program is delayed --  mission accomplished.",它??的病毒?播到灰盒子， 破坏离心机， 伊朗核?目延? -- 任?完成。
"That's easy, huh?",很容易，是吧？
I want to tell you how we found that out.,我想告?大家我?是如何???些的。
"When we started our research on Stuxnet six months ago,  it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was.",?六?月前我??始研究震网病毒?， 我??它的目的一?所知。
"The only thing that was known  is it's very, very complex on the Windows part, the dropper part,  used multiple zero-day vulnerabilities.",唯一知道的是， 它的Windows部分，注入器部分非常非常复?， 使用了多重零日漏洞攻?。
"And it seemed to want to do something  with these gray boxes, these real-time control systems.",它似乎想要? ?些灰盒子，?些??控制系?做些什么。
"So that got our attention,  and we started a lab project  where we infected our environment with Stuxnet  and checked this thing out.",?引起了我?的注意， 我???了一???室?目， 用震网病毒感染我?的系?， 并?行了仔?的?查。
And then some very funny things happened.,接?一些非常有趣的事?生了。
"Stuxnet behaved like a lab rat  that didn't like our cheese --  sniffed, but didn't want to eat.",震网病毒表?的像只 不喜?起司的大白鼠 -- 嗅一嗅起司，但并不想吃。
Didn't make sense to me.,我有些不理解。
"And after we experimented with different flavors of cheese,  I realized, well, this is a directed attack.",而在我???了各种不同的起司之后， 我意?到，?是一?定向攻?。
It's completely directed.,它完全是定向的。
"The dropper is prowling actively  on the gray box if a specific configuration is found,  and even if the actual program code that it's trying to infect  is actually running on that target.",注入器就? 主??入灰盒子里， 即使它正??感染的??的程序 也在干?同?的事儿。
"And if not, Stuxnet does nothing.",如果?有找到目?，震网病毒什么也不做。
"So that really got my attention,  and we started to work on this  nearly around the clock,  because I thought, ""Well, we don't know what the target is.",?确?引起了我的注意， 我??始?夜不停的 ????行研究， 因?我?得我??不知道它的目?呢。
"It could be, let's say for example,  a U.S. power plant,  or a chemical plant in Germany.",目?也?是，打?比方， 一座美???厂， 或德?的化工厂。
So we better find out what the target is soon.",因此我?最好?快找出它的目?。
"So we extracted and decompiled  the attack code,  and we discovered that it's structured in two digital bombs --  a smaller one and a bigger one.",我?提取并反??了 攻?代?， ??它包含???字炸? -- 一?小些的和一?大些的。
And we also saw that they are very professionally engineered  by people who obviously had all insider information.,而我?也??，它?是被了解所有?幕信息的人 非常??地制作出?的。
They knew all the bits and bites  that they had to attack.,他?了解所要攻? 目?的所有??。
They probably even know the shoe size of the operator.,他?甚至知道操作?鞋子的??。
So they know everything.,他?知道一切。
"And if you have heard that the dropper of Stuxnet  is complex and high-tech,  let me tell you this:  the payload is rocket science.",如果各位曾?听??，震网病毒的注入器 复?且是高科技的， ?我告?各位： 它??的病毒非常复?。
It's way above everything  that we have ever seen before.,??超?我? 曾???的技?。
Here you see a sample of this actual attack code.,在?儿各位能看到??的攻?代?的片段。
"We are talking about --  around about 15,000 lines of code.",我?在?? -- 大?1万5千行代?。
Looks pretty much like old-style assembly language.,看起?很像?式的???言。
And I want to tell you how we were able  to make sense out of this code.,我想告?各位我?是 如何弄明白?些代?的。
"So what we were looking for is, first of all, system function calls,  because we know what they do.",我?首先要?找的是系?函??用， 因?我?知道?些函?做什么。
And then we were looking for timers and data structures  and trying to relate them to the real world --  to potential real world targets.,然后我?要找到定?器和?据?构， 接???把它?和??世界?系起? -- 与?在的??世界目??系起?。
So we do need target theories  that we can prove or disprove.,因此我?需要目?理? 我?能用它???与否。
"In order to get target theories,  we remember  that it's definitely hardcore sabotage,  it must be a high-value target  and it is most likely located in Iran,  because that's where most of the infections had been reported.",?了得到目?理?， 我??得 ????造成?重的破坏， 因此必然有?高价值的目?， 而且很有可能就位于伊朗境?， 因?在伊朗?告的病毒感染最多。
Now you don't find several thousand targets in that area.,在?一?域并不????多目?。
It basically boils down  to the Bushehr nuclear power plant  and to the Natanz fuel enrichment plant.,基本上可以把目??小至 布歇赫?核?厂 和?坦?的???厂。
"So I told my assistant,  ""Get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base.""",因此我?我的助理?， “?我一?包含我?客?群中所有离心机和??厂?家的列表。”
And I phoned them up and picked their brain  in an effort to match their expertise  with what we found in code and data.,我跟他?通了??，?他? 用他?的??知??忙 分析我?在代?和?据中的??。
And that worked pretty well.,?非常管用。
So we were able to associate  the small digital warhead  with the rotor control.,我?能把??小的 ?字??与?子控制器 ?系起?了。
"The rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge,  that black object that you see.",???子是离心机?部的??机件， 就是各位看到的那?黑色物体。
"And if you manipulate the speed of this rotor,  you are actually able to crack the rotor  and eventually even have the centrifuge explode.",如果控制???子的速度， ??上就能破解?子 并甚至最?能?离心机爆炸。
"What we also saw  is that the goal of the attack  was really to do it slowly and creepy --  obviously in an effort  to drive maintenance engineers crazy,  that they would not be able to figure this out quickly.",我?也看到了 攻?的目的 是??一切令人恐怖的事?慢地?生-- ?然?? ???工程????， 他?不可能很快找出??所在。
The big digital warhead -- we had a shot at this  at data and data structures.,大的?字?? -- 通?仔?地 ?察?据和?据?构，
"So for example, the number 164  really stands out in that code;  you can't overlook it.",我?有机??它有所了解。 例如，?字164 在?些代?中非常引人注目； 不可能忽略它。
"I started to research scientific literature  on how these centrifuges  are actually built in Natanz  and found they are structured  in what is called a cascade,  and each cascade holds 164 centrifuges.",我?始研究与?些分离机 如何被建造在?坦? 有?的科?文?， 并??它?被??在 一?被????的?西之中， 每???包含164?离心机。
"So that made sense, that was a match.",?有?清楚了，匹配起?了。
And it even got better.,甚至更好地匹配了。
"These centrifuges in Iran  are subdivided into 15, what is called, stages.",在伊朗的?些离心机 被分成15?所?的机?。
And guess what we found in the attack code?,猜?我?在攻?代?中??了什么？
An almost identical structure.,一?几乎完全相同的机??构。
"So again, that was a real good match.",因此，再一次地很好地匹配上了。
And this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at.,?在我?所?行的工作上?了我?更多自信。
"Now don't get me wrong here, it didn't go like this.",?在???我，它不是像???行的。
These results have been obtained  over several weeks of really hard labor.,?些?果中包含了 我??周的辛苦??。
And we often went into just a dead end  and had to recover.,我?常常走入死胡同 并回到起?。
"Anyway, so we figured out  that both digital warheads  were actually aiming at one and the same target,  but from different angles.",?之，我?找出了 ????不同角度 瞄准?同一?目?的 ?字??。
"The small warhead is taking one cascade,  and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down,  and the big warhead  is talking to six cascades  and manipulating valves.",小????一???， 旋?加速?子，接??它?慢下?， 然后大?? ??六??? 并操控??。
"So in all, we are very confident  that we have actually determined what the target is.",?的??，我?非常自信 我?确定了目?是什么。
"It is Natanz, and it is only Natanz.",就是?坦?，只可能是?坦?。
So we don't have to worry  that other targets  might be hit by Stuxnet.,我?并不?心 其他可能被震网病毒 要攻?的目?。
Here's some very cool stuff that we saw --  really knocked my socks off.,有些我?看到的非常酷的?西 -- 确??我大吃一惊的?西。
"Down there is the gray box,  and on the top you see the centrifuges.",?儿下面是灰盒子， 在上面看到的是离心机。
"Now what this thing does  is it intercepts the input values from sensors --  so for example, from pressure sensors  and vibration sensors --  and it provides legitimate program code,  which is still running during the attack,  with fake input data.",事情是??的， 它?截了??感器?送?的?入值-- 例如，?自?力?感器 和震??感器的?入值 -- 并提供合法的代?， ?代??在攻?期?仍然保持?行， ?代?一起的?有假的?入?据。
"And as a matter of fact, this fake input data  is actually prerecorded by Stuxnet.",事?上，?假的?入?据 是震网病毒事先?存的。
"So it's just like from the Hollywood movies  where during the heist,  the observation camera is fed with prerecorded video.",正如好???影 中的?劫片段， ?察?像?被?上了事先?制好的??。
"That's cool, huh?",很酷，不是么？
The idea here is obviously  not only to fool the operators in the control room.,它的打算?然 不?是要愚弄控制室中的操作?。
It actually is much more dangerous and aggressive.,它??上要更危?，更具侵略性。
The idea  is to circumvent a digital safety system.,它的打算 是要???字安全系?。
We need digital safety systems  where a human operator could not act quick enough.,我?需要?字安全系? 在那些人?操作?不能做出足?快的行?的地方。
"So for example, in a power plant,  when your big steam turbine gets too over speed,  you must open relief valves within a millisecond.",例如，在??厂， ?巨大的蒸汽?机?速?快?， 必?在一毫秒?打?安全?。
"Obviously, this cannot be done by a human operator.",?然，人?操作?不可能做到。
So this is where we need digital safety systems.,因此，在?儿就需要?字安全系?。
"And when they are compromised,  then real bad things can happen.",而?它?受到?害?， 真正的??就?出?。
Your plant can blow up.,?厂?爆炸。
And neither your operators nor your safety system will notice it.,操作?和安全系?都不?注意到。
That's scary.,?很可怕。
But it gets worse.,但??更糟。
"And this is very important, what I'm going to say.",我?要?到的，非常重要。
Think about this:  this attack is generic.,想想??。 ?种攻?是通用的。
"It doesn't have anything to do, in specifics,  with centrifuges,  with uranium enrichment.",它不需要?离心机， ????做什么 具体的事情。
"So it would work as well, for example,  in a power plant  or in an automobile factory.",它也???作用，例如， 在一???厂 或是一?汽?制造厂。
It is generic.,?很普通。
"And you don't have -- as an attacker --  you don't have to deliver this payload  by a USB stick,  as we saw it in the case of Stuxnet.",作?一名攻?者，你不需要 -- 不需要用U?把病毒 ?播出去， 如我?在震网病毒?一案例中看到的那?。
You could also use conventional worm technology for spreading.,你也可以用??的蠕虫技??行?播。
Just spread it as wide as possible.,?可能?泛地?播它。
"And if you do that,  what you end up with  is a cyber weapon of mass destruction.",如果做到了?些 最?就??有 一?大?模??性的网?武器。
That's the consequence  that we have to face.,?就是我?不得不 面?的后果。
"So unfortunately,  the biggest number of targets for such attacks  are not in the Middle East.",不幸地是， ??攻??量最多的目? 不是在中?。
They're in the United States and Europe and in Japan.,而是在美?、?洲和日本。
"So all of the green areas,  these are your target-rich environments.",所有?些?色的?域， ?些是目?密集的?域。
"We have to face the consequences,  and we better start to prepare right now.",我?不得不面??些后果， 我?最好立即?始做准?。
Thanks.,??。

So we thought we would look at this challenge  and create an exoskeleton  that would help deal with this issue.,所以我?想我??正??一挑? ?造一?能?助 解??一??的外骨骼。
So let me now introduce to you HULC --  or the Human Universal  Load Carrier.,那么?在?我向各位介?一下HULC -- 全?是人? ?重外骨骼。

"This may sound strange,  but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.",听起?可能有?怪， 我是?水泥?的狂??好者。
The first concrete blocks were manufactured in 1868  with a very simple idea:  modules made of cement of a fixed measurement  that fit together.,第一?水泥?制造于1868年 是源于一?非常??的想法： 把水泥制成的固定大小的? ??到一起。
Very quickly concrete blocks became  the most-used construction unit in the world.,很快水泥?就成?了 全世界使用最多的建筑?元，
"They enabled us to to build things that were larger than us,  buildings, bridges,  one brick at a time.",它使得我?能制造?大于自身的?西， 建筑，?梁， 就??一?一瓦砌成。
Essentially concrete blocks had become  the building block of our time.,水泥???上已?成? 我????代的?木。
"Almost a hundred years later in 1947,  LEGO came up with this.",在大?100年后的1947年， ?高??了??
It was called the Automatic Binding Brick.,??被叫做自????木。
"And in a few short years,  LEGO bricks took place in every household.",然后在短短几年?， ?高?木占?了每?家庭，
It's estimated that over 400 billion bricks have been produced --  or 75 bricks for every person on the planet.,据估?已?制造出的?高?木超?4千?? -- 或者?全球人均75?
"You don't have to be an engineer  to make beautiful houses, beautiful bridges, beautiful buildings.",你不必是一?工程? 也可以建造漂亮的房子，漂亮的?梁，漂亮的建筑。
LEGO made it accessible.,?高使之成?可能。
"LEGO has essentially taken the concrete block, the building block of the world,  and made it into the building block  of our imagination.",?高??上就是把水泥?，?种真?世界中的?木， ?用到建造我?想象中的 建筑?木。
"Meanwhile the exact same year,  at Bell Labs the next revolution was about to be announced,  the next building block.",恰恰在同一年， 在????室，一?新的革命即??布， 下一代?木。
The transistor was a small plastic unit  that would take us from a world  of static bricks piled on top of each other  to a world where everything was interactive.,晶体管是一?小的塑料元件 它?把我?? ??的??堆?起?的世界 ?入到一切都可以交互的新世界。
"Like the concrete block,  the transistor allows you to build  much larger, more complex circuits, one brick at a time.",像水泥?一?， 你可以?用它 一?晶体管一?晶体管地制造出更大的、更复?的?路。
But there's a main difference:  The transistor was only for experts.,但是有一?主要的??： 只有?家才能玩?晶体管。
"I personally don't accept this,  that the building block of our time  is reserved for experts,  so I decided to change that.",我?人不能接受 我????代的?木 只有?家才可以玩， 所以我?定改?它。

A few years ago I started developing littleBits.,几年前我?始??littleBits。
Let me show you how they work.,我?大家演示一下是怎么玩的。
LittleBits are electronic modules  with each one specific function.,LittleBits是?子的模? 每一?都有特定的功能。
"They're pre-engineered  to be light, sound,  motors and sensors.",它?都?先?定好 作?光的，?音的， ??或者?感器。
And the best part about it  is they snap together with magnets.,最棒的就是 它?是用磁力吸合在一起的
So you can't put them the wrong way.,所以就不可能???
The bricks are color-coded.,?些小?是按?色分?的。
"Green is output, blue is power,  pink is input and orange is wire.",?色是?出，?色是?源， 粉色是?入，橙色是?接?。
So all you need to do is snap a blue to a green  and very quickly you can start making larger circuits.,因此你所需要做的就是把?色接到?色上 然后很快你就能?始制造更大的?路了
"You put a blue to a green,  you can make light.",把?的接到?的， 你就做了一??
You can put a knob in between  and now you've made a little dimmer.,你可以在中?放一?旋? 你就做成了一?小?光器。
"Switch out the knob  for a pulse module,  which is here,  and now you've made a little blinker.",拿掉旋? ?上??模?， 在?儿， ?在你就?造出了一?小信??。
Add this buzzer  for some extra punch  and you've created a noise machine.,加入??蜂?器 ?增加?效果 你就?造出了一台噪音机。
I'm going to stop that.,我得收手了。
"So beyond simple play,  littleBits are actually pretty powerful.",除了??地玩， ??上littleBits 的功能很??。
"Instead of having to program, to wire, to solder,  littleBits allow you to program  using very simple intuitive gestures.",不需要?程、接?、焊接， littleBits可以?你 用??的直??作完成?程。
"So to make this blink faster or slower,  you would just turn this knob  and basically make it pulse faster or slower.",比如要把?????快或者?慢一?， 你只需要???旋? ??上是?它??得快或者慢一?。
The idea behind littleBits  is that it's a growing library.,?藏在littleBits之后的想法是 ?是一?可成?的?料?。
We want to make every single interaction in the world  into a ready-to-use brick.,我?想把世界上的每一???的交互功能 做成一??手可用的?木。
"Lights, sounds, solar panels, motors --  everything should be accessible.",光，?音，太?能板，?? -- 一切都??触手可得。
We've been giving littleBits to kids and seeing them play with them.,我?曾?把littleBits?孩子?并看他?玩。
And it's been an incredible experience.,那是一种不可思?的体?。
The nicest thing is how they start to understand  the electronics around them from everyday  that they don't learn at schools.,最棒的就是他??始理解 他?日常身?的?器 ?些?校里是?不到的。
"For example, how a nightlight works,  or why an elevator door stays open,  or how an iPod responds to touch.",比如，夜?是如何工作的 或者?什么?梯?能一直??， 再或者iPod?触摸是怎么反?的。
We've also been taking littleBits to design schools.,我?也曾?把littleBits?到???校。
"So for example, we've had designers  with no experience with electronics whatsoever  start to play with littleBits as a material.",比如?，我?曾????? 完全?有?子相???的??? 用littleBits做素材?始玩。
"Here you see, with felt and paper water bottles,  we have Geordie making ...",大家可以看到，用?和?瓶子 ?迪做出了...
"A few weeks ago we took littleBits to RISD  and gave them to some designers  with no experience in engineering whatsoever --  just cardboard, wood and paper -- and told them ""Make something.""",几星期前我???littleBits去了?德????院 把它交?一些 完全?有工程??的??? 只?一些?板、木?和? -- 跟他?? “做?什么”
"Here's an example of a project they made,  a motion-activated confetti canon ball.",?就是他?完成的一??目 一??作触?的彩?屑炮?
"But wait, this is actually my favorite project.",等等，????上是我最喜?的一??目。
It's a lobster made of playdough  that's afraid of the dark.,是一?橡皮泥做的?? 它很怕黑。
"To these non-engineers, littleBits became another material,  electronics became just another material.",??些非工程技?人?，littleBits成?了另一种材料， ?子也只是一种材料。
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone.,而且我?想使?种材料?所有人都可用。
So littleBits is open-source.,所以littleBits是?源的。
"You can go on the website, download all the design files, make them yourself.",你可以到网站上，下?所有的??文件，自己?制造。
"We want to encourage a world  of creators, of inventors, of contributors,  because this world that we live in,  this interactive world, is ours.",我?想鼓?一? 人人都是?造者、?明家、??者的世界。 因?我?所生活的??世界， ??交互的世界，?于我?每?人。

"Here it kind of looks like he's looking for a date,  but what he's really looking for is for someone to shovel him out when he gets snowed in,  because he knows he's not very good at fighting fires  when he's covered in four feet of snow.",?里看起?它似乎是在等它的??， 但它真正等待的是一?可以?它被深埋在雪下的?候可以?它挖出?的人， 因?它知道?它被四英尺的雪埋入?， 它救火的能力就?下降。
Now how did he come to be looking for help  in this very unique manner?,它是如何用??一种特殊的方式 ??求?助的呢？
We had a team of fellows in Boston last year  through the Code for America program.,去年我?“美?代?” 有?在伯斯?工作的??。

And we say that word with such contempt.,我?用如此鄙夷的?气?????。

They're not fighting that battle that we're all fighting  about who gets to speak;  they all get to speak.,他?不再需要??我?那一代?于 ?可以?有言?自由的?斗； 他?都?有言?自由。
"They can express their opinion  on any channel at any time,  and they do.",他?可以通?任何渠道 在任何??表?他?的意?， 他?也的确?么做。

I'm here to share my photography.,今天我想在此跟大家分享一下我的?影作品
Or is it photography?,或者?，??也是?影作品么？
"Because, of course, this is a photograph  that you can't take with your camera.",因?，??然是一?照片 但?是你用相机拍不出?的
"Yet, my interest in photography started  as I got my first digital camera  at the age of 15.",然而，我??影的?趣 始于我拿到第一???相机后 那?候我15?
"It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing,  but it was a bit different,  because using the camera,  the process was in the planning instead.",?里面??了我之前???的?? 但是有一?不一? 因?使用照相机的?候 整??程已?提前?划好了
"And when you take a photograph with a camera,  the process ends when you press the trigger.",?你拿起相机拍照 ?你摁下快?的?候整??程也就?束了
So to me it felt like photography was more about  being at the right place and the right time.,所以在我看??影更注重 适?的拍?地?和??
I felt like anyone could do that.,我?得任何人都可以做?件事
"So I wanted to create something different,  something where the process starts  when you press the trigger.",所以我想做?特?的 特?之?就在于?你摁下快?? 整??程才???始
Photos like this:  construction going on along a busy road.,比如??照片： 一?繁忙的公路旁?正在?行施工
But it has an unexpected twist.,（?材平凡，）但手法出人意料
"And despite that,  it retains a level of realism.",?管如此 它仍然保留了一份??主?感
"Or photos like these --  both dark and colorful,  but all with a common goal  of retaining the level of realism.",或者像??的照片 既有暗色也有彩色 但是其目的都是 ?了保留一份??主?感
"When I say realism,  I mean photo-realism.",我?的??主? 指的是照片的??主?
"Because, of course,  it's not something you can capture really,  but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow  as a photograph.",因??的确 不是你可以真正抓住的?西 但是我?想?它看起?像是可以用某种方式 被抓拍下?一?
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think  to figure out the trick.,?些照片需要你能?快速 找出它?背后的技巧
So it's more about capturing an idea  than about capturing a moment really.,所以更注重的是捕捉一??感 而不是捕捉一?真?存在的瞬?
But what's the trick  that makes it look realistic?,但是使?些照片看起? 很??的技巧是什么呢？
Is it something about the details  or the colors?,是?于??？ ?是?于色彩？
Is it something about the light?,?是?于光?？
What creates the illusion?,是什么促成了?种幻?？
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion.,有?候不同的?角造成不同的幻?
"But in the end, it comes down to how we interpret the world  and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface.",但最?，?是要??于我?如何理解??世界 以及?种理解如何在一?二?空?得以体?
"It's not really what is realistic,  it's what we think looks realistic really.",?并不是?于什么是真的 而是?于我???什么看起?像是真的
So I think the basics  are quite simple.,所以我???些基本原理 其?很??
I just see it as a puzzle of reality  where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together  to create alternate reality.,我把它看做是??世界的一?拼? 在?里你可以把??世界的不同片段拼?起? ?造另一种真?
And let me show you a simple example.,?我?????的例子
"Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects,  something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world.",?里有三?完全可想象到并真?存在的物体 我?可以在??的三?世界里找到它?
"But combined in a certain way,  they can create something that still looks three-dimensional,  like it could exist.",但若??些物体用某种方式?合起? 就可以?造出??上依然是三?的物体 就好像它是?存在的
"But at the same time, we know it can't.",但是同?我?很清楚它不可能存在
"So we trick our brains,  because our brain simply doesn't accept the fact  that it doesn't really make sense.",就??我??了自己的大? 因?大?就是不肯接受 ??物体其?并不存在?一事?
with combining photographs.,?合照片
It's just really about combining different realities.,也是如此 确?只是把不同的???面?合起?
"So the things that make a photograph look realistic,  I think it's the things that we don't even think about,  the things all around us in our daily lives.",所以使一?照片看起?逼真的事物 是那些我?平?甚至不?去想 但在日常生活中??可?的?西
"But when combining photographs,  this is really important to consider,  because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow.",但是?我??合照片的?候 ??就值得我??重思考了 否?它看起?就??扭
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow  to achieve a realistic result.,我想?的是我?要遵守三???的原? ?了?到一?逼真的效果
"As you can see, these images aren't really special.",你?看，?些?像并不特?
"But combined, they can create something like this.",但是?合起?，它?就可以?造出??的?面
So the first rule is that photos combined  should have the same perspective.,所以第一原?就是所有被?合的照片 都展?同?的?角
"Secondly, photos combined  should have the same type of light.",第二，被?合的照片 ?要有相同的光?
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements --  shot at the same height and in the same type of light.,???照片都符合???要求 它?都?于相同的拍?高度和相同的光?下
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish  where the different images begin and end  by making it seamless.,第三?原?是要?人?以分辨 ?些不同照片的?接? 使?接看起?天衣??
Make it impossible to say  how the image actually was composed.,使任何人都道不出 ??片是如何?作而成的
"So by matching color, contrast and brightness  in the borders between the different images,  adding photographic defects  like depth of field,  desaturated colors and noise,  we erase the borders between the different images  and make it look like one single image,  despite the fact that one image  can contain hundreds of layers basically.",通?匹配不同照片??的 色彩，?比度以及亮度 再加入一下?影瑕疵 比如?野的深度 去?和的色彩和噪音 我?可以除去不同照片之?的?界 使其看起?就像是一??一的照片 即使一?照片 可包含上百???
So here's another example.,?里?有一?例子
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape  and the lower part is what's manipulated.,有人可能???只是一??景? 下面的部分是?理?的
But this image is actually entirely composed  of photographs from different locations.,但是??照片其?整?都是 由不同地方拍?的很多照片?合起?的
"I personally think that it's easier to actually create a place  than to find a place,  because then you don't need to compromise  with the ideas in your head.",我?人???造一?地方比找到一?地方 要容易一些 因?你不用 与自己大?的想法妥?
But it does require a lot of planning.,但是?确?需要很多?划
"And getting this idea during winter,  I knew that I had several months to plan it,  to find the different locations  for the pieces of the puzzle basically.",去年冬天?生??想法? 我知道我有几?月的??去?划?件事 基本上要到不同的地? 找?一拼?所需的?片
"So for example,  the fish was captured on a fishing trip.",比如 ????于一次垂?航行
The shores are from a different location.,海岸拍?于另一?地?
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit.,水下的部分?于一?采石?
"And yeah, I even turned the house on top of the island red  to make it look more Swedish.",?了，我?把?上的房子?成?色的了 使它看起?更具瑞典?
"So to achieve a realistic result,  I think it comes down to planning.",?了?到一?逼真的效果 我??最重要的就是?划
"It always starts with a sketch, an idea.",?是?先出?一?大概的构思和想法
Then it's about combining the different photographs.,然后就是?合不同的照片
And here every piece is very well planned.,?里每一??片都是??仔??划的
"And if you do a good job capturing the photos,  the result can be quite beautiful  and also quite realistic.",如果你能抓拍到很好的照片， 效果?很美。 而且也很逼真
"So all the tools are out there,  and the only thing that limits us  is our imagination.",所以其?所有的工具都在那 唯一限制我?的 是我?的想象力
Thank you.,??大家
"Because I usually take the role  of trying to explain to people  how wonderful the new technologies  that are coming along are going to be,  and I thought that, since I was among friends here,  I would tell you what I really think  and try to look back and try to understand  what is really going on here  with these amazing jumps in technology  that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it.",由于我?常 向人?解? 即?到?的新科技 ??多么的美妙 我想既然我跟各位朋友?一起在? 就?我???我真正的想法 并??回?和理解 ?到底是如何?生的 有了?些科技上的惊人?步。 科技的?步似乎快到我?根本?法赶上它的?步。

"And the interesting thing about it  is that this slide,  like so many technology slides that we're used to,  is a sort of a straight line  on a semi-log curve.",有趣的是 ??幻?片 就像很多我?所熟悉的幻?片一?， 是半??曲?? 上的一?直?。
"In other words, every step here  represents an order of magnitude  in performance scale.",也就是?里的每一?， 代表了性能程度 大小的一?。
And this is a new thing  that we talk about technology  on semi-log curves.,在半??曲??上 ??科技， ?很新?。
Something really weird is going on here.,?其中有?奇特。
And that's basically what I'm going to be talking about.,?基本上是我接下?要?的。
"So, if you could bring up the lights.",麻??一下?。
"If you could bring up the lights higher,  because I'm just going to use a piece of paper here.",?把??亮?， 因?我要用??。
Now why do we draw technology curves  in semi-log curves?,?什么我?要用??曲? 描?科技曲?呢？
"Well the answer is, if I drew it on a normal curve  where, let's say, this is years,  this is time of some sort,  and this is whatever measure of the technology  that I'm trying to graph,  the graphs look sort of silly.",嗯，答案是，如果我用普通曲??， 我??，?是年份， ?是某???， ?是我准??的 科技的某种?量值， ??看起?有?傻。
They sort of go like this.,就有?像是??。
And they don't tell us much.,而且并?有提供什么??。
"Now if I graph, for instance,  some other technology, say transportation technology,  on a semi-log curve,  it would look very stupid, it would look like a flat line.",?在，如果我?，比如?， 另一种技?，像是交通??， 在半??曲?上， 它看起?很蠢，?像?很平的?。
"But when something like this happens,  things are qualitatively changing.",但是如果出?像?种 ??的情?。
"So if transportation technology  was moving along as fast as microprocessor technology,  then the day after tomorrow,  I would be able to get in a taxi cab  and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.",如果交通??技? ?步地像微?理器技?一?快的?， 那，后天 我就能搭一?出租? 然后在30秒?到?京。
It's not moving like that. And there's nothing precedented  in the history of technology development  of this kind of self-feeding growth  where you go by orders of magnitude every few years.,但它并?有?步得那么快。 在科技?展?史中 也?有任何 ?种自?自足， 每几年程度翻倍增?的先例。
"Now the question that I'd like to ask is,  if you look at these exponential curves,  they don't go on forever.",?在我想要?的是， 如果你?察?些指?曲?， 它?并非永?的持?下去。
Things just can't possibly keep changing  as fast as they are.,事物不可能一直 改?得那么快。
One of two things is going to happen.,?件事??生，
"Either it's going to turn into a sort of classical S-curve like this,  until something totally different comes along,  or maybe it's going to do this.",要么它??成像??典型的S曲? 直到完全不同的情?出?。 或是??成??。
That's about all it can do.,?就是所有可能。
"Now I'm an optimist,  so I sort of think it's probably going to do something like that.",?在我是???主?者， 所以我?得它很有可能就??成??。
"If so, that means that what we're in the middle of right now  is a transition.",如果是??，意味?我?目前所在的 是?渡?段。
We're sort of on this line  in a transition from the way the world used to be  to some new way that the world is.,我?似乎在???上， 在世界??去 到??的??中。
"And so what I'm trying to ask, what I've been asking myself,  is what's this new way that the world is?",所有我要?的，我一直在?自己的， 就是?世界未?道路在哪？
What's that new state that the world is heading toward?,它?向的新?代是什么?的？
"Because the transition seems very, very confusing  when we're right in the middle of it.",由于???化似乎非常，非常迷惑人， ?我?正?于其中?。
"Now when I was a kid growing up,  the future was kind of the year 2000,  and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.",我小?候，在?大?程中 未?就像是2000年， 人?都在??2000年???生什么。
"Now here's a conference  in which people talk about the future,  and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000.",?在????上， 大家在??未?， 而且你能???未?指的?是那?“2000年”。
It's about as far as we go out.,?就是我?能?到的程度。
"So in other words, the future has kind of been shrinking  one year per year  for my whole lifetime.",?句??，在我一生中 未?正在 逐年?短。
Now I think that the reason  is because we all feel  that something's happening there.,我想原因是 我?都感?到 正在?生些什么。
That transition is happening. We can all sense it.,?化正在?生。我?都能察?到。
"And we know that it just doesn't make too much sense  to think out 30, 50 years  because everything's going to be so different  that a simple extrapolation of what we're doing  just doesn't make any sense at all.",我?知道去考?那未?的三、五十年 已??什么意?了， 因?每件事都?如此不同 以至于推??? 不再有意?。
"So what I would like to talk about  is what that could be,  what that transition could be that we're going through.",所以我要聊聊 那?是怎?， 我?正在??的???是怎?。
Now in order to do that  I'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff  that really has nothing to do  with technology and computers.,??到??目的， 我得介?一堆?西 它?与 科技和??完全??。
Because I think the only way to understand this  is to really step back  and take a long time scale look at things.,因?我?定理解??的唯一方法 就是回??去 拉????去看。
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on  is the time scale of life on Earth.,而我所要看的??? 是以地球上生命的??跨度?看。
So I think this picture makes sense  if you look at it a few billion years at a time.,我想?幅?合理了 如果你每次?几十?年跨度?看。
"So if you go back  about two and a half billion years,  the Earth was this big, sterile hunk of rock  with a lot of chemicals floating around on it.",所以如果你回溯? 大概25?年， 地球?么大，?瘠的大?石? 上面浮?些化?物?。
"And if you look at the way  that the chemicals got organized,  we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it.",要是?察 ?些化?物?怎??合的， 我??始弄明白它?怎么形成的。
"And I think that there's theories that are beginning to understand  about how it started with RNA,  but I'm going to tell a sort of simple story of it,  which is that, at that time,  there were little drops of oil floating around  with all kinds of different recipes of chemicals in them.",我想有些理?是?理解 生命怎??核糖核酸演??始， 但是我想?一?生命的??故事， 就是，在那??候， 有一滴滴的油四?浮?， 里面有各种不同化?成分?合。
And some of those drops of oil  had a particular combination of chemicals in them  which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside  and grow the drops of oil.,有些油滴 里面含有特殊的化?构成 ??致它?可以?外界聚集化?物? 并慢慢?大。
And those that were like that  started to split and divide.,像??的油滴 又?始分化，分离。
"And those were the most primitive forms of cells in a sense,  those little drops of oil.",最原始的那些在某种程度上形成了?胞， ?些小小的油滴。
"But now those drops of oil weren't really alive, as we say it now,  because every one of them  was a little random recipe of chemicals.",但目前?止?些油滴不是真正活?的，在我??在看?， 因?每一? 都是化?物?的?机合成。
"And every time it divided,  they got sort of unequal division  of the chemicals within them.",每分裂一次， 都不是平均分布 ?部的化?物。
And so every drop was a little bit different.,所以每?油滴都有?不同。
"In fact, the drops that were different in a way  that caused them to be better  at incorporating chemicals around them,  grew more and incorporated more chemicals and divided more.",??上，油滴不同的方式 是?它?能更好地 集成周?的化合物， ?得更大，吸收更多，分裂更多。
"So those tended to live longer,  get expressed more.",所以它??活得更?， 表?得更多。
"Now that's sort of just a very simple  chemical form of life,  but when things got interesting  was when these drops  learned a trick about abstraction.",?就有?像?很??的 生命的化?形式， 但?程?得有趣 是??些油滴 ??了一?提供??的技巧?。
"Somehow by ways that we don't quite understand,  these little drops learned to write down information.",不知怎么用我?不能完全理解的方式， ?些小油滴??了????。
They learned to record the information  that was the recipe of the cell  onto a particular kind of chemical  called DNA.,它???把 ?胞形成的秘? ??到一种特殊物?上， 叫做去氧核糖核酸。
"So in other words, they worked out,  in this mindless sort of evolutionary way,  a form of writing that let them write down what they were,  so that that way of writing it down could get copied.",也就是?，它?想出了， 以?种?性的?化方式， 可以?下它?基因信息的??方式， 以便?种??方式能被复制。
The amazing thing is that that way of writing  seems to have stayed steady  since it evolved two and a half billion years ago.,惊奇的是?种??方式 似乎可以保持?定 由于它25?年前演化出?的。
"In fact the recipe for us, our genes,  is exactly that same code and that same way of writing.",??上我?，我?基因的?成 就是完全一?的代?，一?的??方式。
"In fact, every living creature is written  in exactly the same set of letters and the same code.",??上，任何生物都是 用完全一?的字母和代???下?的。
"In fact, one of the things that I did  just for amusement purposes  is we can now write things in this code.",??上，我所做的 ?是?了??效果的一件事 就是我?能用??代???事件。
"And I've got here a little 100 micrograms of white powder,  which I try not to let the security people see at airports.",我?有100微克的白粉， 我?力不?机?安?人???它?。
But this has in it --  what I did is I took this code --  the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it --  and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA  and amplified it 10 to the 22 times.,不??里面有代? 我所做的是我拿??代? 它里面有我?用???它的?准字母， 然后我把我的名片?到一?去氧核糖核酸上 再放大10到22倍。
"So if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card,  I have plenty for everyone in the room,  and, in fact, everyone in the world,  and it's right here.",所以如果有人需要?百万份我的名片， 我有足?多份?在座每?人， 甚至是全世界每?人， 就在?。
"If I had really been a egotist,  I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room.",要是我是?自大的人， 我就?把它放到病毒里散布到屋子中。
So what was the next step?,所以下一步是什么？
Writing down the DNA was an interesting step.,??去氧核糖核酸是有趣的一步。
And that caused these cells --  that kept them happy for another billion years.,它?致了?胞的形成—— ?它?又高?了几十?年。
"But then there was another really interesting step  where things became completely different,  which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information,  so that they began to get communities of cells.",不??有?很有趣的?? 事情?始?得完全不同， 那就是?些?胞?始交?和交流??， ?而形成?胞?体。
"I don't know if you know this,  but bacteria can actually exchange DNA.",我不知道你?是否知道??， ?菌??上就可以交?去氧核糖核酸。
"Now that's why, for instance,  antibiotic resistance has evolved.",?就是?什么，比如， 演?出抗菌免疫。
"Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin,  and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information  with other bacteria,  and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin,  because bacteria communicate.",有些?菌知道怎么?离青霉素， 然后它?造它??去氧核糖核酸??， 并在?的?菌中到?游走， ?在我?有很多?青霉素免疫的?菌了， 因??菌?交流??。
"Now what this communication allowed  was communities to form  that, in some sense, were in the same boat together;  they were synergistic.",??，?些交流致使 群落的形成， 在某种意?上，它?在同一?船上了； 它?是?作的。
"So they survived  or they failed together,  which means that if a community was very successful,  all the individuals in that community  were repeated more  and they were favored by evolution.",因此它?一起幸存下? 或者一起死去， 也就是?如果一?群落成功了， 所有群落里的?体 都能复制更多， ?化得更有利。
"Now the transition point happened  when these communities got so close  that, in fact, they got together  and decided to write down the whole recipe for the community  together on one string of DNA.",于是，???到了， ??些族群很?近?， 事?上，它?聚集到一起 并?定在一?去氧核糖核酸上 ?下整?族群的成分?。
And so the next stage that's interesting in life  took about another billion years.,生命中下一?有趣的?段 又要几十?年。
"And at that stage,  we have multi-cellular communities,  communities of lots of different types of cells,  working together as a single organism.",在???期， 有多?胞族群， 就是有很多种不同?胞的群落， 作?有机体一起合作。
"And in fact, we're such a multi-cellular community.",??上，我?就是??的多?胞族群。
We have lots of cells  that are not out for themselves anymore.,我?有很多?胞， 它?不再是只?自己存活。
"Your skin cell is really useless  without a heart cell, muscle cell,  a brain cell and so on.",皮??胞根本?用， 要是?有心??胞，肌肉?胞， ??胞等等。
"So these communities began to evolve  so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place  was no longer a cell,  but a community which we call an organism.",所以?些族群?始?化 ???生有趣的?化的 不再??是?一?胞。 而是我???有机体的族群。
Now the next step that happened  is within these communities.,接下??生 就是在?些族群中。
"These communities of cells,  again, began to abstract information.",?些?胞群落， 再次，?始提取??。
And they began building very special structures  that did nothing but process information within the community.,它??始构建非常特?的 ???理群落???的?构。
And those are the neural structures.,?些就是神??构。
So neurons are the information processing apparatus  that those communities of cells built up.,所以神?元是 ?些?胞群建立的???理?器。
"And in fact, they began to get specialists in the community  and special structures  that were responsible for recording,  understanding, learning information.",??上，群落里?始出??家 以及特殊?构 ????， 理解，????。
And that was the brains and the nervous system  And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.,?就是?些?胞群的 大?和神?系?。 ??了它??化的有利?件。
"Because at that point,  an individual --  learning could happen  within the time span of a single organism,  instead of over this evolutionary time span.",因???的?， ?每??体—— ??可以?生 在??有机体的??跨度?， 而不是整??化??跨度。
"So an organism could, for instance,  learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit  because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it.",所以一?有机体能?，比如?， ??不吃某种水果 因?它不好吃而且上次吃的?得?心。
"That could happen within the lifetime of a single organism,  whereas before they'd built these special information processing structures,  that would have had to be learned evolutionarily  over hundreds of thousands of years  by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fruit.",?可以?生在一???有机体的一生中， 然后在?种特殊信息?理?构建成前， ?得要?化?? 千万年， 通?吃了?种水果前仆后?死去的?体。
"So that nervous system,  the fact that they built these special information structures,  tremendously sped up the whole process of evolution.",所以神?系?， 生物?建?种特殊?构的事?， 极大地加速了?化的?程。
Because evolution could now happen within an individual.,因?至此?化可以在?体中?生了。
It could happen in learning time scales.,它能?生在??的??跨度?。
"But then what happened  was the individuals worked out,  of course, tricks of communicating.",但是接下??生的 是每??体??了， ?然，交流的秘?。
"And for example,  the most sophisticated version that we're aware of is human language.",比如?， 我?所知道的最精密的版本就是人??言。
It's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it.,想想看，?真是?奇妙的?明。
"Here I have a very complicated, messy,  confused idea in my head.",我?子里有?很复?，混?， 疑惑的想法。
"I'm sitting here making grunting sounds basically,  and hopefully constructing a similar messy, confused idea in your head  that bears some analogy to it.",我坐在?，基本上就是吐字??， 希望在你???里建立一??似的混? 跟它有??似的想法。
"But we're taking something very complicated,  turning it into sound, sequences of sounds,  and producing something very complicated in your brain.",但是我?正在把很复?的?西 ?化成?音，一?串的?音， 并在你?大??生很复?的?西。
So this allows us now  to begin to start functioning  as a single organism.,所以?在?推?我? ?始?作 作???有机体。
"And so, in fact, what we've done  is we, humanity,  have started abstracting out.",所以，??上，我?已?完成的 就是我?，人?， ?始抽离出?。
"We're going through the same levels  that multi-cellular organisms have gone through --  abstracting out our methods of recording,  presenting, processing information.",我?正在??多?胞有机体??的 相同的?段—— 提取我???， 展示，?理??的方式。
"So for example, the invention of language  was a tiny step in that direction.",比如?，?言的?明 就是??方向上很小一步。
"Telephony, computers,  videotapes, CD-ROMs and so on  are all our specialized mechanisms  that we've now built within our society  for handling that information.",??，??， 影碟，光碟等等 都是我?的特殊机制， 我?正在社?里构建 用??理??的机制。
"And it all connects us together  into something  that is much bigger  and much faster  and able to evolve  So now, evolution can take place  on a scale of microseconds.",?些都是把我??系在一起， ?的 比我?之前 更大， 更快， 更有能力?化。 所以，?在?化可以?生在 微妙的??跨度?上。
And you saw Ty's little evolutionary example  where he sort of did a little bit of evolution  on the Convolution program right before your eyes.,你?看?泰伊的那??化的小例子 它好像就在你?眼前的卷?程式上 展?了一??化了。
So now we've speeded up the time scales once again.,所以?在我?再次加快??跨度。
So the first steps of the story that I told you about  took a billion years a piece.,我?的故事的第一步 每一步花?了几十?年。
"And the next steps,  like nervous systems and brains,  took a few hundred million years.",下一步， 像神?系?和大?， 消耗几百万年。
"Then the next steps, like language and so on,  took less than a million years.",再接下?，像?言等等， 需要不到一百万年。
"And these next steps, like electronics,  seem to be taking only a few decades.",再下一步，像?子器件， 仿佛只要几十年。
"The process is feeding on itself  and becoming, I guess, autocatalytic is the word for it --  when something reinforces its rate of change.",???程是自?自足， 并且?成，我猜，??自我催化描述更合适—— ?事物加快改?的速度。
"The more it changes, the faster it changes.",?化越多，?化就越快。
And I think that that's what we're seeing here in this explosion of curve.,我想?就是我?在?看到的激增曲?。
We're seeing this process feeding back on itself.,我?看到???程回?到自己。
"Now I design computers for a living,  and I know that the mechanisms  that I use to design computers  would be impossible  without recent advances in computers.",我?在工作就是自己????， 我知道用?????的 ?些机制 不可能存在， 要是?有近期??的?步。
"So right now, what I do  is I design objects at such complexity  that it's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense.",?在，我做的 是??复?到 不可能???意?上??的物体。
I don't know what every transistor in the connection machine does.,我不知道?接机器上每??晶体的作用。
There are billions of them.,有几十??晶体。
"Instead, what I do  and what the designers at Thinking Machines do  is we think at some level of abstraction  and then we hand it to the machine  and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do,  much farther and faster than we could ever do.",??上，我所做的 思考机器的????做的， 我???是?某种程度的??抽取， 然后把它??机器 而机器把它?用到超出我?所能做的范?， 而且比我??前所做的更深?更快。
"And in fact, sometimes it takes it by methods  that we don't quite even understand.",??上，有?候它采用的方法 我?并不很懂。
One method that's particularly interesting  that I've been using a lot lately  is evolution itself.,有?尤其有趣 我最近一直在用的 就是?化本身。
So what we do  is we put inside the machine  a process of evolution  that takes place on the microsecond time scale.,我?做的就是 在机器里 放入一??化?程， ???程在微妙??跨度上就能?生。
"So for example,  in the most extreme cases,  we can actually evolve a program  by starting out with random sequences of instructions.",比如， 大部分极端情?下， 我???上能 通???机的指令序列?始?化一?程式。
"Say, ""Computer, would you please make  a hundred million random sequences of instructions.",?“??，?你?生 一??机指令序列。
"Now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions,  run all of those programs,  and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what I wanted.""",?在?你?行所有?些?机指令列， ?行所有程式， 并?出最接近我想要的。”
"So in other words, I define what I wanted.",也就是?，我定?我要什么。
"Let's say I want to sort numbers,  as a simple example I've done it with.",假?我需要分??料， ?是?我用它???的??例子。
So find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers.,找到最接近?料分?的程式。
"So of course, random sequences of instructions  are very unlikely to sort numbers,  so none of them will really do it.",?然，?机的指令序列 非常不可能分??料， 所以它?中?有一?能完成。
"But one of them, by luck,  may put two numbers in the right order.",但是中?有一?，?气很好， 可能?把???按?序排列。
"And I say, ""Computer,  would you please now take the 10 percent  of those random sequences that did the best job.",我?，“??， ?你?在?出序列中百分之十 完成得最好的。
Save those. Kill off the rest.,保存?些。?掉其他的。
And now let's reproduce  the ones that sorted numbers the best.,?在?复制 ?料分?得最好的?些。
And let's reproduce them by a process of recombination  analogous to sex.",以?似交配的重??程 ?复制它?。
"Take two programs and they produce children  by exchanging their subroutines,  and the children inherit the traits of the subroutines of the two programs.",取??程式 交?它?的副程式?它??生子女， ?些子女?承了??程式副程式的特征。
So I've got now a new generation of programs  that are produced by combinations  of the programs that did a little bit better job.,所以我得到新一代的 由?合做的比?好的程式 而?生的程式。
"Say, ""Please repeat that process.""",?，“?重复???程。”
Score them again.,再做一次。
Introduce some mutations perhaps.,可能引入一些突?。
And try that again and do that for another generation.,再?一次并用在新的一代上。
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds.,?一代上每?程式只需要几毫秒。
"So I can do the equivalent  of millions of years of evolution on that  or in the complicated cases, in a few hours.",所以我在??上用几分? 能做等同于 几百万年的?化?程， 或者，情?复??，在几小??完成。
"At the end of that, I end up with programs  that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers.",?束?，我得到 ??完美的分??料的程式。
"In fact, they are programs that are much more efficient  than programs I could have ever written by hand.",??上，?些程式比我手?的 任何程式都要有效率。
"Now if I look at those programs,  I can't tell you how they work.",?在，如果我??些程式， 我?不出它?怎么工作的。
I've tried looking at them and telling you how they work.,我?????并且解?它?如何工作的。
"They're obscure, weird programs.",它?很抽象，奇怪。
But they do the job.,但是它?能完成任?。
"And in fact, I know, I'm very confident that they do the job  because they come from a line  of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job.",??上，我知道，我很有信心，它?能完成任? 因?它??自于一行 上千万能完成??的程式。
"In fact, their life depended on doing the job.",事?上，它?的生命就是靠??工作。
"I was riding in a 747  with Marvin Minsky once,  and he pulls out this card and says, ""Oh look. Look at this.",我曾?有一次 和?文·明斯基一起坐747， 他拿出一?卡，?，“看，看?。
"It says, 'This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts  working together to make you a safe flight.'  Doesn't that make you feel confident?""",?上面?，‘本?机有很多精密部件 ?作，保障你?行安全。’ ?是不是?你很有信心？”
"In fact, we know that the engineering process doesn't work very well  when it gets complicated.",事?上，我?知道工程?程复?化 并不能很好工作。
So we're beginning to depend on computers  to do a process that's very different than engineering.,所以我??始依??? ?做与工程有很大不同的一??程。
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity  than normal engineering lets us produce.,它能?我?生?出 比普通工程能生?的更复?的?西。
"And yet, we don't quite understand the options of it.",然而，我??不明白它的??。
"So in a sense, it's getting ahead of us.",?某种意?上?，??比我?超前。
We're now using those programs  to make much faster computers  so that we'll be able to run this process much faster.,我??在正用?些程式 ?造更快的?? 以便能更快地?行???程。
So it's feeding back on itself.,所以它是自我回?的。
The thing is becoming faster  and that's why I think it seems so confusing.,?正?得更快， ?也是?什么我?得??似乎很?人摸不清。
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves.,由于所有?些技?都回??自己。
We're taking off.,我?正在起?。
And what we are is we're at a point in time  which is analogous to when single-celled organisms  were turning into multi-celled organisms.,我?正是在??的某一?， ?一??似于??胞有机体 正??成多?胞机体的?刻。
So we're the amoebas  and we can't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we're creating.,我?就像?形虫。 搞不清自己正在?造的是什么?西。
We're right at that point of transition.,我?正在?折?上。
But I think that there really is something coming along after us.,不?我??一定有跟??我?的?西。
I think it's very haughty of us  to think that we're the end product of evolution.,我想它是很崇拜我?的， ??我?是?化的?极?物。
And I think all of us here  are a part of producing  whatever that next thing is.,我??我??所有人 都是繁衍的一部分， ??下一步是什么。
"So lunch is coming along,  and I think I will stop at that point,  before I get selected out.",午???快到了， 趁我??被?走， 我想我就在?里?束。
I think we have to do something  about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change.,我?得在?今的??文化中， 有一部份文化必?要?始改?。
"And I think it starts with one physician, and that's me.",而??改?可以?一??生?始，那就是我。
And maybe I've been around long enough  that I can afford to give away some of my false prestige  to be able to do that.,或?是因?我已?行?多年， 我可以承受放?一些??的名利 ??始??的改?。
"Before I actually begin the meat of my talk,  let's begin with a bit of baseball.",在?入主?之前， ?我?先??棒球吧。
"Hey, why not?",?什么不呢？
"We're near the end, we're getting close to the World Series.",常??季就快?束，世界??棒球大?即??始。
"We all love baseball, don't we?",我?都喜?棒球，不是?？
Baseball is filled with some amazing statistics.,棒球的世界中充斥?成千上百种

But there are two problems with that.,但?种想法?衍生出????。
"In my 20 years or so  of medical broadcasting and journalism,  I've made a personal study of medical malpractice and medical errors  to learn everything I can,  from one of the first articles I wrote for the Toronto Star  to my show ""White Coat, Black Art.""",在我二十余年的 ???播和新?工作中， ?我?多?多星?所?的第一篇文章 到我的?目《白袍魔?》， 我自行研究了我可以接触到的 一切??疏失和????。
And what I've learned  is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous.,而我所?到的， 便是????是??不在。

And you know that business  about people not wanting  to talk about their worst cases?,?有就是?于 人?不愿 ??他?所犯的最糟糕的??一事。
"On my show, on ""White Coat, Black Art,""  I made it a habit of saying, ""Here's my worst mistake,""  I would say to everybody  from paramedics to the chief of cardiac surgery,  ""Here's my worst mistake,"" blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,  ""What about yours?"" and I would point the microphone towards them.",在我的?目《白袍魔?》中， 我已????性地?：“?是我最糟糕的??”。 我???急救?士 到心?外科首席??的每?人?么?： “?是我最糟糕的??，如是，如是。” 然后我?把?克???他?，?：“你呢？”
"And their pupils would dilate,  they would recoil,  then they would look down and swallow hard  and start to tell me their stories.",此?他?的瞳孔?放大， 他??退?。 然后他??看?地上，猛吞?口水 并?始向我??他?的故事。

"So the system is evolving  to create backups  that make it easier to detect those mistakes  that humans inevitably make  and also fosters in a loving, supportive way  places where everybody who is observing  in the health care system  can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes  and is rewarded for doing so, and especially people like me, when we do make mistakes,  we're rewarded for coming clean.",??系?才可以不?地?化改革， ?生可以?人更加容易察? ?些?法避免的??的 ?救方案。 与此同?，我?可以培?一??心?怀的工作?境， 鼓?每一位 在?察我?的 ??系?的人 ??指出一些?在的??。 尤其是鼓?像我一?的人，?我?犯?后， 我?可以去正面面?并加以改正。

Do you know how many choices you make  in a typical day?,你知道在日常生活中你平均 每天做多少??？
Do you know how many choices you make  in typical week?,你知道你平均每周 做多少??？
"I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans,  and the average number of choices  that the typical American reports making  is about 70 in a typical day.",我最近在超?2000美?人中 做了一??查， ?果?示，一?典型的美?人 平均每天 做70???。
There was also recently a study done with CEOs  in which they followed CEOs around for a whole week.,另外最近?有一??于CEO?的研究 科?家?在一星期中跟?CEO?
And these scientists simply documented all the various tasks  that these CEOs engaged in  and how much time they spent engaging  in making decisions related to these tasks.,然后??下他?所?与和完成的 各种不同的活?与任? 和他?做的所有与?些任?有?的 ?定所用的??。
And they found that the average CEO  engaged in about 139 tasks in a week.,科?家?由此??，每一?CEO平均 每周?与完成大概139?任?。
"Each task was made up of many, many, many sub-choices of course.",?然了，每?任?又都是由?多小的??构成的。
50 percent of their decisions  were made in nine minutes or less.,?其中50%的?定 都是他?在九分?甚至更短的???做出的。
Only about 12 percent of the decisions  did they make an hour or more of their time.,只有其中百分之十二的?定， 用了他?一小?或更?的??。
Think about your own choices.,想一想你每天做的??。
Do you know how many choices  make it into your nine minute category  versus your one hour category? How well do you think you're doing  at managing those choices?,你知道它?中多少 是“九分?抉?” 又有多少是一小?的??？ 在管理?些??上， 你做的如何？
"Today I want to talk  about one of the biggest modern day choosing problems that we have,  which is the choice overload problem.",今天我要?一? ?在社?中我?所面?的最?重的????： ???多。
I want to talk about the problem  and some potential solutions.,我想要?一??些?? 与一些可行的解??法。
"Now as I talk about this problem,  I'm going to have some questions for you  and I'm going to want to know your answers.",我?在先?????， 我要?你?一些?? 然后我希望得到你?的答案。
"So when I ask you a question,  since I'm blind,  only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories.",所以?我?你?一??? 由于我看不?， 不要?手除非你只是想消耗一下卡路里。
"Otherwise, when I ask you a question,  and if your answer is yes,  I'd like you to clap your hands.",（笑?) 否?，?我?你?一???， 如果你的答案是：是， 我希望你?可以鼓掌。

"So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University,  I used to go to this very, very upscale grocery store;  at least at that time it was truly upscale.",?我?是斯坦福大?的一名本科?生?， 我?常去一?非常高?的??店； 至少在??看?那家店是十分高?的。
It was a store called Draeger's.,它的名字是Draeger‘s。
"Now this store, it was almost like going to an amusement park.",去那家店，就像是去游??一?。
They had 250 different kinds of mustards and vinegars  and over 500 different kinds  of fruits and vegetables  and more than two dozen different kinds of bottled water --  and this was during a time when we actually used to drink tap water.,他?有250种不同的?芥末和醋 ?有超?500中不同种?的 蔬菜和水果 ?有超?24中不同的瓶?水 而那是我??在喝水??里的水的年代。
"I used to love going to this store,  but on one occasion I asked myself,  well how come you never buy anything?",我?去十分喜?去?家店， 但是有一次我?自己， ?什么你??都不??西呢？
Here's their olive oil aisle.,?是?橄?油的?道。
"They had over 75 different kinds of olive oil,  including those that were in a locked case  that came from thousand-year-old olive trees.",他?有75种以上不同的橄?油， 包括那些被?在盒子里 ?4000年的橄??上取?的油。
"So I one day decided to pay a visit to the manager,  and I asked the manager,  ""Is this model of offering people all this choice really working?""",于是有一天我?定去拜?一下?家店的?理， 我?他， “???人?所有??的模型真的有用么？”
"And he pointed to the busloads of tourists  that would show up everyday,  with cameras ready usually.",然后他向我示意了那些每天都??的 一?一?的 ??相机的游客。
"We decided to do a little experiment,  and we picked jam for our experiment.",我??定做一?小??， 然后??了果?作???品。
Here's their jam aisle.,?是?果?的走廊。
They had 348 different kinds of jam.,他?有148种不同的果?。
We set up a little tasting booth  right near the entrance of the store.,在店?口的地方 我???了一?小的品?台。
"We there put out six different flavors of jam  or 24 different flavors of jam,  and we looked at two things:  First, in which case  were people more likely to stop, sample some jam?",我?在那儿?6种 或24种不同味道的果?， 然后我??察了?件事： 第一，人?在哪种情?下 更愿意停下?步品?一些果?？
"More people stopped when there were 24, about 60 percent,  than when there were six,  about 40 percent.",相比?下，大部分，?60%的人，在有24种果?走廊停了?步， 而?有6种果?? 只有40%的人。
The next thing we looked at  is in which case were people more likely  to buy a jar of jam.,我??察的另一件事是： 在人?在哪种情?下更愿意 ?一罐果?
Now we see the opposite effect.,??，我??察到了相反的?果。
"Of the people who stopped when there were 24,  only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam.",在那些在有24种果??停下的人?中， 只有3%的人真正?了果?。
"Of the people who stopped when there were six,  well now we saw that 30 percent of them  actually bought a jar of jam.",而此?，在那些在有6种果??停下的人?中， 我???有30%的人 ?了果?。
"Now if you do the math,  people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam  Now choosing not to buy a jar of jam  is probably good for us --  at least it's good for our waistlines --  but it turns out that this choice overload problem affects us  even in very consequential decisions. We choose not to choose,  even when it goes against our best self-interests.",?在如果你算一下的?， ?人?只有六种???， 比有24种? ?果?的?向上升了至少六倍 ??不?果? 也??我???是一件好事儿 至少?我?的水桶腰??， 但是?果?明?度??甚至在 非常重要的?定上影?我?。 我?甚至在有悖?人利益的情?下， 宁愿放???。
So now for the topic of today: financial savings.,所以?在?介?我?今天的??：金融理?。
"Now I'm going to describe to you a study I did with Gur Huberman, Emir Kamenica, Wei Jang  where we looked at the retirement savings decisions  of nearly a million Americans  from about 650 plans  all in the U.S.","?在我要向你?介?我与Gur Huberman, Emir Kamerica, Wei Jang 一起做的一??于 近百万美?人在全美650多种 ?老金?划中 ??的"
"And what we looked at  was whether the number of fund offerings  available in a retirement savings plan,  the 401 plan,  does that affect people's likelihood  to save more for tomorrow.",研究。 我?研究了 ?老金?划， 也就是401（k)雇?福利中 所提供的基金???量， 是否影?人? ?未?存款的几率。
And what we found  was that indeed there was a correlation.,我???， ?之前?是有?系。
"So in these plans, we had about 657 plans  that ranged from offering people  anywhere from two to 59 different fund offerings.",于是在?些?划中，我???了657? ?提供2到59种基金 的不同?划。
"And what we found was that,  the more funds offered,  indeed, there was less participation rate.",我???， 事?上，提供的基金越多， ??率就越低。
"So if you look at the extremes,  those plans that offered you two funds,  participation rates were around in the mid-70s --  still not as high as we want it to be.",所以如果?察一下极端的情?的?， ???那些提供?客??种基金的?划 的??率在70左右， 仍然?有我?期待中的那么高。
"In those plans that offered nearly 60 funds,  participation rates have now dropped  to about the 60th percentile.",那些提供接近60种基金的?划， ??率降低到了 60多的??率。
"Now it turns out  that even if you do choose to participate  when there are more choices present,  even then, it has negative consequences.",由此看?， 即使是你真的???与一??划， ?那么多?划?在你面前?， ?是?造成?面的影?。
"So for those people who did choose to participate,  the more choices available,  the more likely people were  to completely avoid stocks or equity funds.",所以?于那些???与?划的人??， ??越多， 他?越容易?? 完全避?股票或?似的基金。
"The more choices available,  the more likely they were  to put all their money in pure money market accounts.",??越多， 越容易造成人? 把?存???的存???中。
Now neither of these extreme decisions  are the kinds of decisions  that any of us would recommend for people  when you're considering their future financial well-being.,?在，??种极端?? ?有一种是?考?到朋友未?的生活?， 我??推荐?朋友的 好的??。
"Well, over the past decade,  we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices.",在?去十年中， 我??察到了提供人?越?越多的??
They're more likely to delay choosing --  procrastinate even when it goes against their best self-interest.,所造成的?面影? 他?越?越容易推???的?程， 即使??做??害到自身的利益。
"They're more likely to make worse choices --  worse financial choices, medical choices.",人?更容易做出更差的??- 更差的理???，????。
"They're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied,  even when they do objectively better.",人?更容易??那些令自己不?意的??， 即使那些??也?客???并?有那么差。
"The main reason for this  is because, we might enjoy gazing at those giant walls  of mayonnaises, mustards, vinegars, jams,  but we can't actually do the math of comparing and contrasting  and actually picking from that stunning display.",?是因?， ?然我?很享受看一排一排 由美乃滋，?芥末，醋和果?建成的的高?， ?不愿意?自比? 然后在如此?大的?列中做出??。
So what I want to propose to you today  are four simple techniques --  techniques that we have tested in one way or another  in different research venues --  that you can easily apply  in your businesses.,所以今天我想向你?介? 四种??的技巧- 它?都是你可以?松地 ?用在生意上， 并且被????多次的 可靠技巧。
The first: Cut.,一：精?。
"You've heard it said before,  but it's never been more true than today,  that less is more.",你?以前也?听?， 但???法在?前的社??未像?今一?的适用- “少即是多”
"People are always upset when I say, ""Cut.""",每一次我?“精?"的?候，人??是?很生气。
They're always worried they're going to lose shelf space.,他??心??做??致他??失自我空?。
"But in fact, what we're seeing more and more  is that if you are willing to cut,  get rid of those extraneous redundant options,  well there's an increase in sales,  there's a lowering of costs,  there is an improvement of the choosing experience.",但事?上，根据我?所?察到的是 ?一?人越是愿意 放?多余的??， 使得???上升， 价格降低， 越是?改善原?的??。
"When Proctor &amp; Gamble  went from 26 different kinds of Head &amp; Shoulders to 15,  they saw an increase in sales by 10 percent.",?保洁公司 ?26种不同的海???至15种?， ?售?上升了百分之十。
"When the Golden Cat Corporation  got rid of their 10 worst-selling cat litter products,  they saw an increase in profits  by 87 percent --  a function of both increase in sales  and lowering of costs.",?金?公司 停止了他?的十种?售量最差的??的?售， 盈利上升了 百分之八十七- 是又能增加?售? ?降低了成本?全其美的好方法。
"You know, the average grocery store today  offers you 45,000 products.",正如你?所知道的，?在一?普通的??店 提供45000种商品?你??。
"The typical Walmart today offers you 100,000 products.",一?典型的沃???你提供100000种商品。
"But the ninth largest retailer,  the ninth biggest retailer in the world today  is Aldi,  and it offers you only 1,400 products --  one kind of canned tomato sauce.",但是，第九大的零售商 今天世界上第九大的零售商， 是阿?迪， 而他?只提供??客1400种商品- 一种罐?番茄?。
"Now in the financial savings world,  I think one of the best examples that has recently come out  on how to best manage the choice offerings  has actually been something that David Laibson was heavily involved in designing,  which was the program that they have at Harvard.",在??理?的世界中， 我??在?于如何最有效地管理??中 最好的例子是 David Laibson十分投入的 一?哈佛的?目。
Every single Harvard employee  is now automatically enrolled  in a lifecycle fund.,哈佛的每一?教?工 都自?被登?加入 一?生活周期基金中。
"For those people who actually want to choose,  they're given 20 funds,  not 300 or more funds.",那些愿意自己??的人， 有20种不同的基金??， 而不是300种甚至更多。
"You know, often, people say,  ""I don't know how to cut.",你知道，人?很喜??， ”我不知道怎么消?
They're all important choices.",?些都是非常重要的??。”
"And the first thing I do is I ask the employees,  ""Tell me how these choices are different from one another.",所以我做的第一件事是??些教?工， “告?我?些??与其他那些有何不同，
"And if your employees can't tell them apart,  neither can your consumers.""",如果你的?工?不能分辨它?的不同， 你的?客肯定也不能。“
"Now before we started our session this afternoon,  I had a chat with Gary.",今天下午在??活??始之前， 我跟Gary聊了一?儿。
And Gary said that he would be willing  to offer people in this audience  an all-expenses-paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world.,Gary跟我?他愿意 ?今天在?的所有??提供 一次到??世界上最美的路的旅行，
Here's a description of the road.,并且完全免?。
And I'd like you to read it.,我希望你??一下 ???路的描?。
And now I'll give you a few seconds to read it  if you're ready to take Gary up on his offer.,?在我?你?几秒?自己?一下， 如果你愿意接受Gary的提?的?，
Okay. Anybody who's ready to take him up on his offer.,就?鼓掌。  好，有人愿意接受他的提?么？
Is that all?,?有其他人了么？
"All right, let me show you some more about this.",好吧，我多?你?看一些有?此事的。
"You guys knew there was a trick, didn't you.",你?早就知道?是???了，是吧？
Now who's ready to go on this trip.,?在，有?愿意去?次旅行？
I think I might have actually heard more hands.,（??鼓掌）  我以?我?听到更多掌?呢。
All right.,好吧，
"Now in fact,  you had objectively more information  the first time around than the second time around,  but I would venture to guess  that you felt that it was more real the second time around.",事?上， 客?地??， 你?第一次的?候比第二次得到的信息要多， 但是我冒昧地猜 你??得第二次更真?一些。
Because the pictures made it feel  more real to you.,因?那些照片?你? 感?更真?。
"Which brings me to the second technique  for handling the choice overload problem,  which is concretization.",而??例子就是我?今天要?的第二? ?理???多的技巧， 具体化。
"That in order for people to understand  the differences between the choices,  they have to be able to understand  the consequences associated with each choice,  and that the consequences need to be felt  in a vivid sort of way, in a very concrete way.",?了令人?更好地理解 ?多??之?的??， 他?必?理解， 每一???所???的后果， 而?些后果必?是可以 十分清晰、具体地感受到的。
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more  when they use an ATM card or a credit card  as opposed to cash?,?什么人?平均每天花 比用?今多15%到30%的?? 在自?提款机或信用卡上呢？
Because it doesn't feel like real money.,因?那?感?不像是真正的?。
And it turns out  that making it feel more concrete  can actually be a very positive tool  to use in getting people to save more.,所以 原?使感?更具体化 可以成?令人???的 好方法。
"So a study that I did with Shlomo Benartzi  and Alessandro Previtero,  we did a study with people at ING --  employees that are all working at ING --  and now these people were all in a session  where they're doing enrollment for their 401 plan.",所以在一?我与Shlomo Benartzi 和Alessandro Precitero做的研究中， 我?和所有ING的 ?工一起做了一?研究， 所有人都?加了一? 一起注?401雇?福利的??。
"And during that session,  we kept the session exactly the way it used to be,  but we added one little thing.",在???程中 我?在保持每???完全相同的情?下， 加了一?小?西。
"The one little thing we added  was we asked people  to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life  By doing that simple thing,  there was an increase in enrollment by 20 percent  and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save  or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account  by four percent.",我?加的是， ?他? 每?人都想象如果多存一些 生命中可能??生的那些美好的事情。 ??是??做后， ?与率上升了百分之二十， 人?愿意存?的??或者?是 愿意放?自己?蓄??的金?增?了 百分之四。
The third technique: Categorization.,第三?技巧：分?。
We can handle more categories  than we can handle choices.,相比?理????， 我?可以?松?理更多??。
"So for example,  here's a study we did in a magazine aisle.",比如?， 我?做了一?有???志??道的研究，
"It turns out that in Wegmans grocery stores  up and down the northeast corridor,  the magazine aisles range anywhere  from 331 different kinds of magazines  all the way up to 664.",??在Wegmans百?商店中， 在?北走廊的地方， ??志的那一? 有331到 甚至664种?志。
But you know what?,但是你?知道么？
"If I show you 600 magazines  and I divide them up into 10 categories,  versus I show you 400 magazines  and divide them up into 20 categories,  you believe that I have given you  more choice and a better choosing experience  if I gave you the 400  than if I gave you the 600.",如果我先?你?看600本?志， 然后把它?分成10?， 然后再?你?看400本?志， 但是分成20?， 你??相信， ?我?你?看 400本?志? 比?你?600本?的??更多，??体?更好。
Because the categories tell me how to tell them apart.,因???可以?我分辨它?的??。
Here are two different jewelry displays.,?里有??不同的珠?展示，
One is called "Jazz" and the other one is called "Swing.",一?叫“爵士”，另一?叫“??”
"If you think the display on the left is Swing  and the display on the right is Jazz,  clap your hands.",如果你?得左?的是“??” 右?的是“爵士” 就?鼓掌。
"Okay, there's some.",好吧，有一些。
"If you think the one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  clap your hands.",如果你?得左?的是“爵士”， 右?的是“??” ?鼓掌。
"Okay, a bit more.",稍微多一?儿了。
Now it turns out you're right.,你?是?的。
"The one on the left is Jazz and the one on the right is Swing,  but you know what?",左?的的确是“爵士”，而右?的正是“??”， 但是你知道么？
This is a highly useless categorization scheme.,?是一?十分?用的分???。
"The categories need to say something  to the chooser, not the choice-maker.",??必?可以告? ??者一些事情，而不是?造??的人。
And you often see that problem  when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds.,你?也?可以在 那些冗?的基金名?中看到????。
Who are they actually supposed to be informing?,到底?才是??得到信息的人呢？
My fourth technique: Condition for complexity.,我的第四?技巧是：??入繁
"It turns out we can actually  handle a lot more information than we think we can,  we've just got to take it a little easier.",事?上，我?所能 承受的信息量比我?想象的要高， 我?需要做的就是用?松地面度?待。
We have to gradually increase the complexity.,我?必?逐?加大复?程度。
I'm going to show you one example of what I'm talking about.,?在我?你??一?有?的例子。
"Let's take a very, very complicated decision:  buying a car.",我??一起做一?非常非常复?的?定： ??。
Here's a German car manufacturer  that gives you the opportunity to completely custom make your car.,?在有一?德?制造商， 愿意?你定制一?完全?性化的?。
"You've got to make 60 different decisions,  completely make up your car.",你必?要做60?不同的?定 才能做好???。
Now these decisions vary  in the number of choices that they offer per decision.,?些?定包括 每一??定所提供的??。
"Car colors, exterior car colors --  I've got 56 choices.",光?的?色，?置的?色 就有56种??。
"Engines, gearshift -- four choices.",有四种??机，?速排???。
So now what I'm going to do  is I'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear.,?在我要做的是 改??些要做的?定出?的?序。
"So half of the customers  are going to go from high choice, 56 car colors,  to low choice, four gearshifts.",所以，一般的?? 要???多的?定?始-56种?色 ?始到??少的?定-四种?速排?。
"The other half of the customers  are going to go from low choice, four gearshifts,  to 56 car colors, high choice.",另外一半的?? 要???少的?定，四种???始 到56种??色，??多的?定
What am I going to look at?,我想要?察什么呢？
How engaged you are.,你?有多?极。
"If you keep hitting the default button per decision,  that means you're getting overwhelmed,  that means I'm losing you.",如果你不停地按默???的? 就?明你已?被??淹?了， 也就是?我正在失去你的?与。
"What you find  is the people who go from high choice to low choice,  they're hitting that default button over and over and over again.",你???， ???多的?始到??少的人 ?不停地??默???。
We're losing them.,我?就?逐?失去他?了
"They go from low choice to high choice,  they're hanging in there.",那些???少?始到??多的人， ?在?持?。
It's the same information. It's the same number of choices.,可是他?所得到的信息是完全一?的。所要做的??也是一?的。
The only thing that I have done  is I have varied the order  in which that information is presented.,我所做的唯一一件事就是 改?了 信息所出?的?序。
"If I start you off easy,  I learn how to choose.",如果我?你一??松的?始， 教你如何??。
"Even though choosing gearshift  doesn't tell me anything about my preferences for interior decor,  it still prepares me for how to choose.",即使???速排? 不能?明我????色的偏好 ?仍能教?我如何去??。
"It also gets me excited about this big product that I'm putting together,  so I'm more willing to be motivated  to be engaged.",另一件令我??的事?是我所要?成的是如此一??然大物， 所以我?得更有?力 去?与。
So let me recap.,?我重新整理一下重?，
"I have talked about four techniques  for mitigating the problem of choice overload --  cut -- get rid of the extraneous alternatives;  concretize -- make it real;  categorize -- we can handle more categories, less choices;  condition for complexity.",我?了四种可以???多??的 技巧- 精?-放??有用的??； 具体化-????得更真?一些； 分?-我?能承受的??比??多； ??入繁。
"All of these techniques that I'm describing to you today  are designed to help you manage your choices --  better for you, you can use them on yourself,  better for the people that you are serving.",今天我所?的所有技巧， 都是?了?助你更好地管理??而??的- 使用?些技巧?你更好， 也?你所服?的那些人更好。
Because I believe that the key  to getting the most from choice  is to be choosy about choosing.,所以我相信 ???中?益最多的??是 ???挑剔一些。
And the more we're able to be choosy about choosing  the better we will be able  to practice the art of choosing.,我????越是挑剔 就越能 掌握??的??。
Thank you very much.,非常感?。
"In the 1980s  in the communist Eastern Germany,  if you owned a typewriter,  you had to register it with the government.",20世?80年代 在共?主?的?德， 如果你有一台打字机， 你就得去跟政府登?。
You had to register  a sample sheet of text  out of the typewriter.,你必?登? 出自那台打字机的 一份文本的?本。
And this was done  so the government could track where text was coming from.,??做后， 政府就能跟?文本出自何方。
"If they found a paper  which had the wrong kind of thought,  they could track down  who created that thought.",如果他???一??上 ????的??， 他?就能跟? 是??生??的??。

You probably all agree with me  that this is a very nice road.,(??）  （微波??） 你?也??同意 ??路很不?。

The solution for that is to make roads  out of porous asphalt.,解?的?法就是 使用多孔?青?修路。
"Porous asphalt, a material that we use now  in most of the highways in the Netherlands,  it has pores and water can just rain through it,  so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides,  and you have a road that's easy to drive on,  so no splash water anymore.",多孔?青?种材料 用在荷?的多?高速公路上， 它有些小毛孔?水??去， 雨水?流向旁?， 路上??就容易了， 也?有?起的水花。
Also the noise will disappear in these pores.,噪音也?消失在?些毛孔里。
"Because it's very hollow, all the noise will disappear,  so it's a very silent road.",因?它有很多空洞，相互抵消了噪音， 所以路就很安?。
"It also has disadvantages, of course,  and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur.",?然，它也有缺?， ?种路的缺?是?青可能?松?。
What is raveling? You see that in this road  that the stones at the surface come off.,什么叫松?？看看??路 路面上的石??落。
"First you get one stone, then several more,  and more and more and more and more,  and then they -- well, I will not do that.   But they can damage your windshield,  so you're not happy with that.",?始一?，接?几?， 越?越多， 后?就——我就不演示了。 但它???坏你的??玻璃， 你肯定不高?。
"And finally, this raveling can also lead to more and more damage.",最后，?种松????越?越多的?害。
Sometimes you can create potholes with that.,有?候路面?出?坑槽
Ha. He's ready.,哈，他早有准?。
"Potholes, of course, that can become a problem,  but we have a solution.",坑坑洼洼?然??成??， 但我?有解?的?法。
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material.,?里你看到的是?种材料上出?的?害。
"It's a porous asphalt, like I said, so you have only  a small amount of binder between the stones.",?是?青，就像我?的， 石?中?有少量的粘合?。
"Due to weathering, due to U.V. light, due to oxidation,  this binder, this bitumen,  the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink,  and if it shrinks, it gets micro-cracks,  and it delaminates from the aggregates.",由于?化、紫外?、氧化等原因 ?种粘合?，?种?青， 集料之?的黏??收?， 如果它收?，就?有小裂?， ?集??始?出?分?。
"Then if you drive over the road, you take out the aggregates --  what we just saw here.",如果你在?种路上行?，你??出?些集料-- 就是我?看到的。
"To solve this problem, we thought of self-healing materials.",?了解?????，我?考?到了自我修复材料。
"If we can make this material self-healing,  then probably we have a solution.",如果我?能??种材料自我修复， 就有可能有解?方案。
"So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans,  and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces,  and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen.",我?用的就是清洁?具用的???， ???可以裁成很小?， 我?把?些小?混??青。
So then you have asphalt  with very small pieces of steel wool in it.,所以?在的?青 有一些小???在里面。
"Then you need a machine, like you see here,  that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine.",你再需要一?像??的机器， 一?感??机——它可以用?做?。
"Induction can heat, especially steel; it's very good at that.",感??机可以加??西，尤其擅?加???
"Then what you do is you heat up the steel,  you melt the bitumen,  and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks,  and the stones are again fixed to the surface.",所以我?要做的就是把??加?， 把?青溶化， ?青就?流?那些小裂?里， ?落的小石子就又被粘上了。
Today I use a microwave because I cannot take  the big induction machine here onstage.,由于感??机太大了拿不上?， 我在?里就用微波?演示了。
So a microwave is a similar system.,微波?跟感??机的原理?似。
"So I put the specimen in, which I'm now going to take out  to see what happened.",我把?品放?去了，?在把它拿出? 看看?生了什么事。
So this is the specimen coming out now.,?是?品?在的?子。
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab  to heat up the specimens.,我???室里有工?用的机器 ?加??品。
"We tested a lot of specimens there,  and then the government, they actually saw our results,  and they thought, ""Well, that's very interesting. We have to try that.""",我????很多?品， 政府也看?我?的?果， 他??定，“?很有趣，我????一下。”
"So they donated to us a piece of highway,  400 meters of the A58, where we had to make  a test track to test this material.",政府免?授?了一段高速公路?我?， 在A58?上400米的距离， 我?就在那里做了材料??。
"So that's what we did here. You see where we were making the test road,  and then of course this road will last several years  without any damage. That's what we know from practice.",?就是我?做的。你看到的就是做的??路段， ?然?段路近几年不?坏。 我?在??中确?了??。
So we took a lot of samples from this road  and we tested them in the lab.,我?在?段路上取了很多?品 在??室里?行各种??。
"So we did aging on the samples,  did a lot of loading on it, healed them with our induction machine,  and healed them and tested them again.",我?做了老化??， 加了很多??，用我?的感??机?它?加?， 重复加?和??。
Several times we can repeat that.,我?可以多次重复。
"So actually, the conclusion from this research is that  if we go on the road every four years  with our healing machine -- this is the big version  we have made to go on the real road --  if we go on the road every four years  we can double the surface life of this road,  which of course saves a lot of money.",事?上，????得到的??是 如果我?每四年在?段路上 用我?的加?机器——超大?微波? 我?要把??机器搬到公路上用—— 我?每四年上?段路 路面的?命?加倍， ?然?省很多?。
"Well, to conclude, I can say  that we made a material  using steel fibers, the addition of steel fibers,  using induction energy to really  increase the surface life of the road,  double the surface life you can even do,  so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks.",所以，??是 我?制造了一种材料 使用???，加了??? 使用感?能量 有效的增加了路面的?命， 能使路面的?命加倍， 用?种??的技巧就?省很多?。
And now you're of course curious if it also worked.,你?好奇是否?有效。
So we still have the specimen here. It's quite warm.,我?看???品。?在?有??。
"Actually, it still has to cool down first  before I can show you that the healing works.",事?上，我要先?它冷?下? 才能向你?展示加?修复是否有效。
But I will do a trial.,但是要??一下。

One of my favorite words in the whole of  the Oxford English Dictionary is "snollygoster.",我很喜?的?之一 在整?牛津英??典里叫“snollygoster”。
Just because it sounds so good.,不?因?它听起?很不?。
And what snollygoster means is  "a dishonest politician.",而且它的意思是 “一???的政客”。
"Although there was a 19th-century  newspaper editor who defined it rather better when he said,  ""A snollygoster is a fellow who seeks office  regardless of party, platform or principle,  and who, when he wins,  gets there by the sheer force  of monumental talknophical assumnancy.""",?管?只是一?19世?的 ?????出的一?很好的定?，他的原?： “‘snollygoster’是一???的家伙，他??了?求高位 而不在乎任何政党、任何舞台或任何原?， 他?用其三寸不?之舌 口若?河而?得高位。”
Now I have no idea what "talknophical" is.,我一?儿也不明白“talknophical”是什么意思。
"Something to do with words, I assume.",大概是和言???相?的??，我假?。
"But it's very important that words are at the center of politics,  and all politicians know they have to try and control language.",但是言????于政治中心之作用是非常重要的， 并且所有的政客都明白他?必????控制他?的??言?。

And it was only a few years later  that we have the first recorded use of the phrase  "as bold as brass.",而且??几年后 我?有了第一次??使用短? “as bold as brass” （意?：敢作敢?）
Most people think that's down to the metal.,很多人????短?出自于金?什么的。
It's not. It's down to a campaigner  for the freedom of the press.,不是的，它是出自于 一?新?自由?士。
"But to really show you how  words and politics interact,  I want to take you back to the United States of America,  just after they'd achieved independence.",不??了真?的表明 ??和政治怎?互相影?， 我想?你回到?去的美?， 在它??宣布?立的?候。

And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages.,就????在??上??了很久很久。
"And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table,  which might have made it.",并且?生了很多建?， ?些建?貌似可行。
"I mean, some people wanted him to be called  Chief Magistrate Washington,  and other people, His Highness George Washington,  and other people, Protector of the Liberties of the People of the United States of America Washington.",我的意思是，一些人想叫他? 首席行政官?盛?， 而另一些人?他??治·?盛?殿下， ?有人叫他美利??合政府自由解放的保?者?盛?。
Not that catchy.,?有一?朗朗上口的名字。
Some people just wanted to call him King.,一些人只是想叫他?王。
They thought it was tried and tested.,他???是???是?去用?并??考?的。
"And they weren't even being monarchical there,  they had the idea that you could be elected King  for a fixed term.",他?甚至并?有延?君主制， 他?的主意是你可以是??的?王 有一?固定的任期。
"And, you know, it could have worked.",你知道的，??大概?可行。
"And everybody got insanely bored, actually,  because this debate went on for three weeks.",而且每一?人都感到神???似地??了，事?上， 因?????持?了3??拜。
"I read a diary of this poor senator,  who just keeps coming back, ""Still on this subject.""",我??一???可怜??的日?， 里面持?的???，“竟然又是????。”
And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that  the House of Representatives were against the Senate.,而致使延期和?倦的原因是 ??院????院。
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington  to get drunk on power.,??院不想??盛? 沉醉于?力。
"They didn't want to call him King  in case that gave him ideas, or his successor ideas.",他?不想?他??王 以防万一他或他的?任者??生什么想法。
"So they wanted to give him the humblest, meagerest,  most pathetic title that they could think of.",所以他??他一?他?能?想到的，最低微的、最微不足道的、 最?可悲的??。
And that title was "President.",而????叫“President”。
"President. They didn't invent the title. I mean, it existed before,  but it just meant somebody who presides over a meeting.",President （??主持，??）。他??有?造????。我的意思是，????以前就有， 但是它是指一???的主持人。
It was like the foreman of the jury.,同陪??主席的意思相似。
And it didn't have much more grandeur  than the term "foreman" or "overseer.",并且它一?也不?得非常极其地位?赫 比起“foreman”和“overseer”?。
"There were occasional presidents of little colonial councils  and bits of government, but it was really a nothing title.",?然偶??有一些小型殖民地的??主持人 并有一?政府管理的意思，但是它真的是?什么都不是的??。
And that's why the Senate objected to it.,而且?也是?什么??院反?????。
"They said, that's ridiculous, you can't call him President.",他????真的很荒?，你?不能叫他??主持。
This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries.,??人?得去???和接?外?。
And who's going to take him seriously  if he's got a silly little title  like President of the United States of America?,????真?待他， 如果他只有一???愚蠢的小?? 比如美利??邦政府主持？
"And after three weeks of debate, in the end  the Senate did not cave in.",之后??三周的??， 最后??院也?有屈服。
"Instead, they agreed to use the title ""President"" for now,  but they also wanted it absolutely set down  that they didn't agree with it  from a decent respect for the opinions and practice of civilized nations,  whether under republican or monarchical forms of government,  whose custom it is to annex,  through the office of the Chief Magistrate, titles of respectability --  not bloody President --  and that in the intercourse with foreign nations,",作?替代，他?同意先用???“President”， 但他?也要求??确定下? 他?不同意???? 是出于?文明?家的意?和做法的尊重， ??是民主党?是共和党?政， 他??自定?它， 通?首席行政官?公室，?得非常体面的???? - 而不是杯具的“President”- ?有在同外?交??，
"the majesty of the people of the United States  may not be hazarded by an appearance of singularity,  i.e., we don't want to look like bloody weirdos.",美利?人?的威? 可能不?有被??奇特???害的危?， 即我?不想被后人看成一群杯具的??。
Now you can learn three interesting things from this.,?在???故事里你能?了解到三件有趣的事情。
"First of all -- and this is my favorite --  is that so far as I've ever been able to find out,  the Senate has never formally endorsed the title of President.",首先，也是我最喜?的地方， 到目前?止所有我能找到的?料里， ??院???有正式的?可?“??”????。
"Barack Obama, President Obama, is there on borrowed time,  just waiting for the Senate to spring into action.",巴拉克·?巴?，“???巴?”的??，到?在?是?借的， 只是在一直等待??院的突然正式任命。
Second thing you can learn is that  when a government says that this is a temporary measure --   --  you can still be waiting 223 years later.,第二件事你可以了解到 ?美?政府宣??只是一???措施? -- -- 它?持?223年之久。
"But the third thing you can learn,  and this is the really important one,  this is the point I want to leave you on,  is that the title, President of the United States of America,  doesn't sound that humble at all these days, does it?",但第三件事你能了解到的， 而且也是非常重要的一件， 我很想?你??住??要?， 就是????，美利??邦政府??， 听起???也?有?地位低微的意思，不是?？
"Something to do with the slightly over 5,000  nuclear warheads he has at his disposal  and the largest economy in the world  and a fleet of drones and all that sort of stuff.",大概是有?超?5000多的 核??被他支配控制?， ?有?全世界最大的??体， ?有一大群?机及其他?事力量。

And so the Senate won in the end.,所以最后??院?了。
They got their title of respectability.,他?得到了他?要的体面??。
"And also, the Senate's other worry, the appearance of singularity --  well, it was a singularity back then.",而且，??院?心的另一件事，????听起?很古怪 -- 哦，它曾?在那段?光听起?古怪。
"But now, do you know how many nations have a president?",但是?在，你知道?在有多少??家有???？
"All because they want to sound like  the guy who's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads, etc.",?都是因?他?想?自己的??听起? 像那??有5000多?核??的家伙，等等。
"And so, in the end, the Senate won  and the House of Representatives lost,  because nobody's going to feel that humble  when they're told that they are now  the President of the United States of America.",所以到最后，??院胜利了 ??院?了， 因??有人?感到不体面 ?他?被告知他??在是 美利??邦政府??。
"And that's the important lesson I think you can take away,  and the one I want to leave you with.",而且?是很重要的一?我??你?能??到的， 也是我想留?你?的要?。
"Politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality  and control reality, but in fact,  reality changes words far more  than words can ever change reality.",政客?小心翼翼地??用?，并利用??塑造 和控制??，但是事?上， ??改?????超? ??能改?的??。

"Now, if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons  and fire into this bottle,  how will those photons shatter into this bottle?",?在，如果你把??子?，?些光子 打入??瓶子里， ?些光子?怎么?撞?瓶子？
How does light look in slow motion?,光在慢?作下?是什么?？

"Because the tomato is actually ripe,  and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato,  and it comes out after several trillionths of a second.",?什么？因?西?柿熟了， 并且光在西?柿?部反射， 在几万?分之一秒后出?。
"So in the future, when this femto-camera is in your camera phone,  you might be able to go to a supermarket  and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it.",所以，在未?，??米成像相机 在你的手机里的?候， 你就可以去超市， 不用摸就能?查一下水果是否熟了。

"But we're going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure,  so you're going to get hardly any light.",但我?需要比最短的曝光?? 快一百万倍， 所以你几乎得不到任何光。
"So what we do is we send that bullet --  that packet of photons -- millions of times,  and record again and again with very clever synchronization,  and from the gigabytes of data,  we computationally weave together  to create those femto-videos I showed you.",所以，我?做的是， 把?些光子送?去，并重复百万多次， 每次都以极好的同步?像， 然后?几?GB的?据中， 我?“??”起?一幅?， 而?幅?就是你?之前看到的。

"And a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera,  but most interestingly,  they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot.",而一部分光?最? 返回到相机里，但最有趣的是， 他??在略微不同的??到?。
And because we have a camera that can run so fast --  our femto-camera -- it has some unique abilities.,而且因?我?有一?可以?行如此之快的相机， 也就是我?的?秒相机，??相机就有一些特?的能力。
"It has very good time resolution,  and it can look at the world at the speed of light.",它有很好的??分辨率， 并且可以以光速捕捉世界。
"And this way, we know the distances, of course to the door,  but also to the hidden objects,  but we don't know which point corresponds to which distance.",所以??，我?不?知道相机到?的距离， 同?知道到?藏物品的距离， 但我?不知道哪?? ??哪?距离。
"By shining one laser, we can record one raw photo,  which, if you look on the screen, doesn't really make any sense.",通?用激光，我?能??一?原始的照片， 也就是你?在屏幕上看到的??，好像?什么意?，

My work focuses on the connection of  both thinking about our community life  being part of the environment  where architecture grows from the natural  local conditions and traditions.,"作?一名建筑???, 我在??建筑的?候?同?考?, 建筑与周?的自然?境,, 以及建筑与周?的人文?境, 即??文化之?的?系."
Today I brought two recent projects  as an example of this.,"今天, 我?与大家分享?? 基于?种理念的案例."
"Both projects are in emerging countries,  one in Ethiopia and another one in Tunisia.","???案例都位于新??家, 一?在埃塞俄比?, 另一?在突尼斯."
And also they have in common  that the different analyses from different perspectives  becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture.,"???案例的共同?之一, 在于??方案的最?成型?程中, ?多?不同的角度 ?建筑的分析, 构成了??方案重要的?成部分."
The first example started with an invitation  in Ethiopia's capital city Addis Ababa.,第一?案例起源与我受到邀? 去?埃塞俄比?首都?的斯??巴 ??一?新的多??物??.
"And this is the type of building  we were shown as an example, to my team and myself,  of what we had to design.","?就是??我和我的?? ?得的一??例, 我?被要求 ??成?种?子."
"At first, the first thing I thought was,  I want to run away.",我??始看到??的感?是 我真不想干了.
After seeing a few of these buildings --  there are many in the city --  we realized that they have three very big points.,在?察了?似?种?格的建筑之后-- ??城市有很多?种?格的建筑-- 我???了?些建筑最重要的三???.
"First, these buildings, they are almost empty  because they have very large shops  where people cannot afford to buy things.","首先, ?些建筑基本上都是空的, 因?他?里面都是一些大的商?, ?地人是?不起那些大品牌的."
"Second, they need tons of energy to perform  because of the skin treatment with glass  that creates heat in the inside,  and then you need a lot of cooling.","第二???, 它?需要大量的能源去??度, 因?建筑外??的都是玻璃, ?种????量困在建筑?部, ??致我?需要很多制冷??."
In a city where this shouldn't happen  because they have really mild weather  that ranges from 20 to 25 degrees the whole year.,"?种情?不???生在?座城市, 因??座城市的气候是相?宜人的, 全年?度?定在20~25度左右."
And third is that their image has nothing to do  with Africa and with Ethiopia.,第三???就是??建筑看起?跟非洲 或者埃塞俄比?一??系都?有.
It is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions.,"?于一?文化底?如此丰富的城市, ?太叫人失望了."
"Also during our first visit to Ethiopia,  I was really captivated by the old merkato  that is this open-air structure  where thousands of people, they go and buy things  every day from small vendors.","同?, 在我第一次考察埃塞俄比?的?候, 我被?地的集?市?深深的迷住了. 每天, 成百上千的人 聚集在露天的建筑?境中, ?小商?手里 ?到各种想要的商品."
And also it has this idea of the public space  that uses the outdoors to create activity.,"?跟我的想法是一致的, 就是在室外 公共?合?造各种活?的想法."
"So I thought, this is what I really want to design,  not a shopping mall.","于是我想, ?才是我想要??的, 忘掉?物中心吧."
"But the question was how we could do a multistory,  contemporary building with these principles.","但是??是, 我?怎么才能在??一? ?代多?建筑中???些理念呢?"
"The next challenge was when we looked at the site,  that is, in a really growing area of the city,  where most of these buildings that you see in the image,  they were not there.","第二?挑?就是?我??始??的?候, ?是一座快速?展的城市, 你?在照片上看到的很多建筑物, 在我???的?候 根本不存在."
And it's also between two parallel streets  that don't have any connection for hundreds of meters.,"而且?座建筑前后靠?的??平行街道, 在前后几百米都?有小路可以?通."
"So the first thing we did was to create a connection  between these two streets,  putting all the entrances of the building.","于是我?首先要做的就是 利用我??座建筑物的 所有出入口, ????路?起?."
And this extends with an inclined atrium  that creates an open-air space in the building  that self-protects itself with its own shape  from the sun and the rain.,"然后我?通?一??斜的中庭的??, ?造了一??放的建筑空?, 而且?种??能?通?自身的形?避免下面的行人 受到日晒雨淋."
"And around this void  we placed this idea of the market with small shops,  that change in each floor because of the shape of the void.","????些空洞, 我?划分出很多的小商?, 基于我?小集市的想法. 每?的商?的布局都是??空洞的形?不同而不同."
"I also thought, how to close the building?","我思考的另一???是, 建筑物的外?如何???"
And I really wanted to find a solution  that would respond to the local climate conditions.,"而且我真的希望能?找到一种????, 能?适合?地的气候?件."
"And I started thinking about the textile  like a shell made of concrete  with perforations that would let the air in,  and also the light, but in a filtered way.","我?始?想一种?理?构, 用?有穿孔的水泥制成, 能?用一种受控的方式, ?外界的光?和空气能??入建筑物中."
And then the inspiration came from these beautiful patterns of the Ethiopian women's dresses.,我??埃塞俄比??女美?的??服?的?案上得到了?感.
That they have fractal geometry properties  and this helped me to shape the whole facade.,"?些?案中包含了一些几何形?的 ?理片段, 我??似的????了整?外?."
And we are building that  with these small prefabricated pieces  that are the windows that let the air and the light  in a controlled way inside the building.,"我??外?使用的 是?些小的?制材料, ?些窗?能??空气和光? 按照我?控制的方式?入建筑物."
And this is complemented by these small colored glasses  that use the light from the inside of the building  to light up the building at night.,"?了????, 我?使用?些小的有色玻璃, 利用建筑物?部的光源, 在夜?照亮整?建筑."
"With these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers  because they were like,  ""This is not a shopping mall. We didn't ask for that.""","但是我?的?些想法一?始并?有打?建造者, 他?的反??似于, ""?根本不是商?. ?不是我?想要的."""
But then we all realized that this idea of the market  happened to be a lot more profitable than the idea of the shopping mall  because basically they had more shops to sell.,"但是?后我?都??到, ?种??方案 比??的?物商?的方案更加的能??, 因??种??方案能?出售的店??量更多."
"And also that the idea of the facade was much, much cheaper,  not only because of the material compared with the glass,  but also because we didn't need to have air conditioning anymore.","而且?种外?的??, 降低了很多很多的成本, 不??是因??种?制的材料比玻璃要便宜, ?因?我?不再需要使用那么多的空??控制?度了."
So we created some budget savings  that we used to implement the project.,?果我?最? ???了一部分?算.
And the first implementation was to think  about how we could make the building self-sufficient in terms of energy  in a city that has electricity cuts almost every day.,"构造?段的第一???就是思考 如何保?大?能?在?力上自?自足, 因?所在的城市几乎每天都要拉?限?."
So we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof.,于是我?在屋??上了很多的太?能?池板.
And then under those panels  we thought about the roof like a new public space with gathering areas and bars  that would create this urban oasis.,"接?我?想, 能不能在屋?, 在?些太?能?池板下面, 放置一些桌椅用?休息, ??里成?城市中的?洲, 供人?小憩."
"And these porches on the roof,  all together they collect the water to reuse for sanitation on the inside.","屋?上的?些游廊, 被集中利用?收集雨水, 用于建筑?部的清洁."
"Hopefully by the beginning of next year, because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction.","我??在已??到第五?, ??在明年初的?候完工."
"The second example is a master plan  of 2,000 apartments and facilities in the city of Tunis.",第二?案例是?突尼斯城?划一? 超?2000套?公寓及附??施的建筑.
"And for doing such a big project, the biggest project I've ever designed,  I really needed to understand the city of Tunis,  but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture.","做?么大?模的?目, ?是我做?的最大的?目, 我不?需要非常深刻的理解突尼斯??城市, ?需要理解与她相?的种种??以及文化."
"During that analysis I paid special attention to the medina  that is this 1,000-year-old structure that used to be closed by a wall,  opened by twelve different gates, connected by almost straight lines.","在分析的?程中我的注意力被一?阿拉伯人聚居?吸引, ?是一?有?一千多年?史的?构, ???构, 有12??, 相互之?通?几乎是直?的道路相?."
"When I went to the site, the first design operation we did  was to extend the existing streets, creating 12 initial blocks  similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in Barcelona  and other cities in Europe with these courtyards.","?我?始在??上?划, 我?做的第一件事情 就是延?周?的街道, ?大??分割12?基本的小?? 在大小和特征上都?似于我?在巴塞?那 和其它?洲城市常?的街??划."
"On top of that, we selected some strategic points  reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines,  and this modified this initial pattern.","在?些街??划的基?上, 借??才提到的想法, 我???了一些???, ??些???通?直? ?接起?, 改?了一?始的模式."
"And the last operation was to think about the cell,  the small cell of the project, like the apartment,  as an essential part of the master plan.","最后一步是考?具体的???建筑的??, ?些?似公寓的小隔?, 是构成??巨大?划的基本?成部分."
"And for that I thought, what would be the best orientation  in the Mediterranean climate for an apartment?","???候我在想, ?于一?位于地中海气候的公寓, 什么?的朝向是最好的?"
"And it's north-south, because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house  and then a natural ventilation.","答案是南北朝向, 可以利用房子南北??的?度差异, ?造了一?自然的穿堂?效果."
So we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments  are perfectly oriented in that direction.,"于是我???了?种模式,?所有的公寓 都?有完美的朝向."
And this is the result  that is almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.,"?是我???的效果, 像是一种?合, 阿拉伯城市?格与?洲住宅?格的?合."
"It has these blocks with courtyards,  and then on the ground floor  you have all these connections for the pedestrians.","有些建筑??是?有走庭院的, 而周?地面上的 人行道能?完整的?接起?."
And also it responds to the local regulations that establish  a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor.,"同?她也?足的?地管理部?的需求, 上?建筑中的人口密度高, 地面人口密度不高."
And it also reinforces this idea of the gates.,同?她也?足了我??出入口之??通性要求.
"The volume has this connecting shape  that shades itself with three different types of apartments  and also lets the light go on the ground floor in a very dense neighborhood  And in the courtyards there are the different facilities,  such as a gym and a kindergarten  and close by, a series of commercial [spaces] that bring activity to the ground floor.","??建筑群的相互?接的形?, 通?三?不同?型的公寓建筑, 起到遮?的作用. 同?, ??光能?透?密集的建筑穿透到地表. 在?些中庭之?, 包含了?多不同的?施, 像是健身?, 幼儿?等, 以及一系列商???, ?公共?域充?活力."
"The roof, which is my favorite space of the project  is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction.","屋?是???目中我最得意的部分, ?就像是?被?些建筑物占用的空?重新??了社?."
"And it's where all the neighbors, they can go up and socialize,  and do activities such as having a two-kilometer run in the morning,  jumping from one building to another.","社?的人?可以爬上屋?, 相互打打招呼聊聊天, 或者做一些??, 像是在早晨的?候在屋?上 跑??公里, 或是在建筑之??回跳?."
"These two examples,  they have a common approach in the design process.","???案例 有一些共同?, 在???程中采用了同?的方法."
"And also, they are in emerging countries where you can see  the cities literally growing.","同?, 他?都位于新?城市, 你能直?的看到 建筑物一??拔地而起."
"In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives of today and tomorrow  changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow.","在?些城市, 建筑?于人?的影?, ???下?是未? ??地社?及??的影?, 跟建筑物建造的速度一?快."
"For this reason, I see even more importance  to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions  that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment  and that aim to connect nature and people.","出于??原因, 我?得?于建筑??而言, ???衡越?越重要, 即, ?找??并且足?便宜的方案, 能?增?和促??地的人?与城市?境的?系, 并且能??人很好的接近自然."

"And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence,  I don't know the answer.",如果我在?有?据的基?上考?， 我真的不知道答案是什么。
I'm inclined to think it may have declined  in some activities or some institutions  and it might have grown in others.,我?向于??信任感确?是有降低， 但那是在某些活?中，或者在某些机构里。 而在其他的方面也?是增加的。
I don't have an overview.,我?法一概而?。
"But, of course, I can look at the opinion polls,  and the opinion polls are supposedly  the source of a belief that trust has declined.",但?然了，我可以去看看民意?查， 民意?查??是 ?得信任感在降低的出?。
"When you actually look at opinion polls across time,  there's not much evidence for that.",但?你真的去看看不同??的民意?查的?， 其??有多少?据支持????。
"That's to say, the people who were mistrusted  20 years ago,  principally journalists and politicians, are still mistrusted.",也就是?，那些 在20年前就不被相信的人 主要是?者和政客，?在仍不被信任。
"And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago  are still rather highly trusted: judges, nurses.",而20年前就被高度信任的人， 比如法官和?士，?在仍得到高度的信任。

So they're looking at the generic attitudes  that people report when you ask them certain questions.,不?就是一些普遍的?度。 你?他?什么，他?就?什么。
Do you trust politicians? Do you trust teachers?,你信任政客?？信任老??？
"Now if somebody said to you, ""Do you trust greengrocers?",如果有人?你，“你信任蔬菜商?？”
Do you trust fishmongers?,你信任??的?？

That's a perfectly rational thing.,非常理性的回答。
"In short, in our real lives,  we seek to place trust in a differentiated way.",?而言之，在我???生活中， 我?以不同的方式??求信任。
We don't make an assumption that the level of trust  that we will have in every instance of a certain type  of official or office-holder or type of person  is going to be uniform.,我?不?信任感的程度做假?。 我???特定?型?行具体分析。 那些公??，官?之?的人， ?被?型化。

"So if we've got those evidence in our ordinary lives  of the way that trust is differentiated,  why do we sort of drop all that intelligence  when we think about trust more abstractly?",在日常生活中我?有了??的?据， ?信任感是有?分的， 那么?什么民意?查?我?一下子糊涂了， 把信任感想得更概念化了呢？
"I think the polls are very bad guides  to the level of trust that actually exists,  because they try to obliterate the good judgment  that goes into placing trust.",我?得民意?查是?很差?的 衡量信任感是否存在的依据。 因?它抹?了人?良好的判?力。 ?考?信任感的判?力。
"Secondly, what about the aim?",第二，那?目的是怎么回事儿呢？
The aim is to have more trust.,目的是我?需要更多的信任感。
"Well frankly, I think that's a stupid aim.",坦白?，我?得??目的挺可笑的。
It's not what I would aim at.,?不是我想的那?目的。
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy  but not in the untrustworthy.,我??，人????值得信?的更加地信任。 而不是去信任不值得信?的人。
"In fact, I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy.",??上，我所?的目的是?量不要信任不值得信?的人。

More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life.,?度地信任?人不是一?很明智的目的。
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust  is the proper aim.,明智地信任和明智地??不信任 才是正确的目的。
"Well once one says that, one says, yeah, okay,  that means that what matters in the first place  is not trust but trustworthiness.",那么有人?，好呀，好， ?不就是?最重要的 不是要去信任，而是信?度?？
It's judging how trustworthy people are  in particular respects.,就是?要判??人在某些方面 是否值得信任。
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things.,我?得要想正确做出判?需要考?三?。
Are they competent? Are they honest? Are they reliable?,要看他?是否??？是否??？是否可靠？
"And if we find that a person is competent  in the relevant matters,  and reliable and honest,  we'll have a pretty good reason to trust them,  because they'll be trustworthy.",如果我??得一?人是??的， 在他自己的?域是??的。 而且是??可靠的。 我?就有理由去相信他?， 因?他?是可信?的。
"But if, on the other hand, they're unreliable, we might not.",但是反??，如果他?不可靠，那我?就不能信任他?。
"I have friends who are competent and honest,  but I would not trust them to post a letter,  because they're forgetful.",我有一些??可靠的朋友， 但我就信不?他?去?我寄信， 因?他?很健忘。
"I have friends who are very confident  they can do certain things,  but I realize that they overestimate their own competence.",我有些非常自信的朋友， 他?很能干， 但是我?得他?有些?于自信。
"And I'm very glad to say, I don't think I have many friends  who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest.",?然我很高?的是，我的朋友都是 ??可靠，又不是非常不??的。
"If so, I haven't yet spotted it.",也?有，我????。
But that's what we're looking for:  trustworthiness before trust.,我?需要的就是： 信任?人之前要看他的信?度。
Trust is the response.,信任是我?的反?。
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge.,信?度是需要我??判?的。
"And, of course, it's difficult.",所以?然?不是容易做到的。
"Across the last few decades, we've tried to construct  systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions  and professionals and officials and so on  that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness.",?去的几十年里，我?努力地建立 各种机构里的??制度， 是否?到??水准或者官方要求等等 ?些使我?更容易判?是否有信?。
A lot of these systems have the converse effect.,很多机构都有??的逆反?。
They don't work as they're supposed to.,他?不象他???做的那?做事。
"I remember I was talking with a midwife who said,  ""Well, you see, the problem is it takes longer  to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby.""",我?得和我一?助?士聊天，她? ”你看看，?在的??是我要 ??什么手?比接生一?孩子??！“
"And all over our public life, our institutional life,  we find that problem,  that the system of accountability  that is meant to secure trustworthiness  and evidence of trustworthiness  is actually doing the opposite.",在我?的公共生活里，我?的机构生活里， 我???很多??。 ?些机构里的??制度 ?些能保障自己的信? 能作?值得信任的依据的制度 往往施行起?是相反的。
"It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks,  like midwives, from doing them  by requiring them to tick the boxes, as we say.",?就使人??以?注自己的工作， 比如助?士?， ?他?把??浪?在填表上。就象我?提到的。
You can all give your own examples there.,你?其?都有??的??。
So so much for the aim.,?于目的要?的很多很多。
"The aim, I think, is more trustworthiness,  and that is going to be different  if we are trying to be trustworthy  and communicate our trustworthiness to other people,  and if we are trying to judge whether other people  or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy.",我想??目的更重要的是?方的信?度。 那就完全不一?了。 比如?我?努力去成?值得信任的人， 把我?值得信任的一面展示??人。 比如?我?先判??人， 官?或者政客是否值得信任。
"It's not easy. It is judgment, and simple reaction,  attitudes, don't do adequately here.",?不是容易的事。?是判?，是迅速反?， 是?度，在?里都?不完。
"Now thirdly, the task.",那么第三?，?于任?。
"Calling the task rebuilding trust, I think,  also gets things backwards.",??任?叫做重建信任感。 ?又是弄反了的。
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.,??任?建?你和我要重建信任。
"Well, we can do that for ourselves.",好吧，我?能?自己?么做，
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness.,我?能重建一些自己的信?，
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust.,我?可以互相努力增加我?的信任。
"But trust, in the end, is distinctive  because it's given by other people.",但?根到底，信任是很?特的。 因?是?自他人的。
You can't rebuild what other people give you.,你不可能重建?人?你的看法。
You have to give them the basis  for giving you their trust.,你需要做出努力 ?人家信任你。
"So you have to, I think, be trustworthy.",我是?，你要成?一?值得信?的人。
"And that, of course, is because you can't fool  all of the people all of the time, usually.",?然，?就是?你不能 在永?愚弄住所有的人，一般??。
But you also have to provide usable evidence  that you are trustworthy.,你得提供一些有用的依据， ??人知道你是值得信?的。
How to do it?,??怎么做？
"Well every day, all over the place, it's being done  by ordinary people, by officials, by institutions,  quite effectively.",其?每天，在不同得地方， 普通人，?公人?，各?机构都在努力， 往往做得很有效呢。
Let me give you a simple commercial example.,我?你????的商家??的例子，
"The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back,  and they don't ask any questions.",有?商店?我可以把?的?子退回去， 他??不?任何??。
They take them back and give me the money  or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted.,他?收退?，我拿退?款。 或者?我?是我喜??色的?子。
That's super. I trust them  because they have made themselves vulnerable to me.,?很好。我信任他?。 因?他??我?得他?是?于弱?。
I think there's a big lesson in that.,我?得?很有教益。
"If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party,  then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy  and you have confidence in what you are saying.",如果?于?人，你使自己?于弱?， ?就是?很好的值得信任的依据。 ?自己?的?就有自信。
"So in the end, I think what we are aiming for  is not very difficult to discern.",所以最?呢，我?的意? 就不那么?辨?了。
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy  and can judge when and how the other person  is trustworthy.,人?是否值得信任是一种人和人之?的?系。 我?可以判?什么?候人?是如何 值得你信任的。
"So the moral of all this is,  we need to think much less about trust,  let alone about attitudes of trust  detected or mis-detected by opinion polls,  much more about being trustworthy,  and how you give people adequate, useful  and simple evidence that you're trustworthy.",?道?上?， 我?要少考?信任， 更不要??信任的?度， 或者??民意???判?或者?判， ?我?更?注于成?值得信?的人。 ?注于如何提供恰?、有益 ??的依据?人??得你是可以信?的。

"Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital  for over four hundred years,  at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom,  about four thousand years ago.",伊其塔?曾?是古埃及的首都， ??400年， ??古埃及?于中王??期， 大?4000年前。
"The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt,  and the site is really important, because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance  for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.",?址坐落在如今埃及的法尤姆。 ?座?址非常珍?，因?在中王??期 是一?古埃及??，建筑，宗教的复??期
"Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy  was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it,  indicated within the red circles here,  but somewhere within this massive flood plain.",埃及?家很早就知道伊其塔?的大概位置， 在?位?城?王的金字塔附近， 也就是用?圈的?域， 在?片??的泛洪?的某?。
This area is huge --  it's four miles by three miles in size.,?篇?域非常??， 四公里?，三公里?。
"The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy,  and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east,  it covered over the city.",尼?河曾?在“伊其塔?”古城周?流? ??河道?化，河流??的向?移? 最?覆?了?座城市。

We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow.,然后看出尼?河?去流?哪里。

"And, five meters down,  underneath a thick layer of mud,  we found a dense layer of pottery.",5米朝下， 在一?厚厚的泥?下， 我???了包含大量陶器的地?。
"What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy,  five meters down,  we have a layer of occupation for several hundred years,  dating to the Middle Kingdom, dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is.",??明，在??可能的位置 5米朝下 是一?有几百年?史的地?， 其?史可以追溯到中王??期，正好是我???伊其塔?存在的?期。
"We also found work stone --  carnelian, quartz and agate  that shows that there was a jeweler's workshop here.",我??找到了石料—— 各种?瑙，水晶，?示出 ?里曾?有一?珠?作坊。
"These might not look like much,  but when you think about the most common stones  used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom,  these are the stones that were used.",?些可能看起?很普通， 但比?一下中王??期 珠?最常用的石料， ?就是那些最常?的石料。
"So, we have a dense layer of occupation  dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site.",所以我?在?里找到了一?人?居住?的痕?， 一直追溯到中王??期。
"We also have evidence of an elite jeweler's workshop,  showing that whatever was there was a very important city.",我?同?有一座名?珠?作坊的?据， ?示不?如何，?是一座非常重要的城市。
"No Itjtawy was here yet,  but we're going to be returning to the site  in the near future to map it out.",?里?不一定是伊其塔?， 但我?在不遠的未來就?回到?片?址 去?行??。
"And even more importantly,  we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology  so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well.",更重要的是， 我?????年?的埃及人 使用?星技?， ??他?自己也能?做出?些重要??了。
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom --  it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago.,所以我想用中王??期，我最喜?的引述 ?作??尾—— ?句?很可能在4000年前，在伊其塔??下的

"Through a college prep program,  I was able to take part  in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.",在?科期?， 我?与了 在?城??的全?青年大?。
"My particular group's focus was on youth violence,  and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life,  this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate.",我??的??是?于青少年暴力， 作?倍受欺?的受害者， ????我很感?趣。
The members of our group came from many different walks of life.,??都有?不同的生活??。
"One day toward the end of the convention,  I found out that one of the kids I had befriended  was Jewish.",大??近?束的某天， 我??我的某?朋友 是?太人。
"Now, it had taken several days  for this detail to come to light,  and I realized that there was no natural animosity  between the two of us.",我也是?了几天 才知??件事情， 我??到，我?之? 并?有与生俱?的仇恨。
"I had never had a Jewish friend before,  and frankly I felt a sense of pride  in having been able to overcome a barrier  that for most of my life I had been led to believe  was insurmountable.",我?未有??太朋友， 坦白地?，我?此感到?傲， 能?跨越 我人生?大部分?? ??是不可能逾越的障?。
"Another major turning point came when  I found a summer job at Busch Gardens,  an amusement park.",另一??折?是， 某年暑假，我在布希花? ??主???打工。
"There, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures,  and that experience proved to be fundamental  to the development of my character.",我??到有?不同信仰， ?自不同文化的人?， ??的?? ?我的人格?展 是至?重要的。
"Most of my life, I'd been taught  that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,  that all gay people were a negative influence.",因?在?去的日子， 我接收到的教育是， 同性?是罪?的， 据此推?， 所有的同性?者都有? 消极的影?。
"As chance would have it, I had the opportunity  to work with some of the gay performers  at a show there,  and soon found that many were the kindest,  least judgmental people I had ever met.",在我打暑期工的??里， 我有机?和同性?演? 一起合作， 我很快??，很多同性?者 是我所??最善良， 最自由?放尊重他人的人。
"Being bullied as a kid  created a sense of empathy in me  toward the suffering of others,  and it comes very unnaturally to me  to treat people who are kind  in any other way than how I would want to be treated.",在儿童?期被欺?的?? 教?我要?他人的遭遇 感到同情和怜?， ?我??， 我?善待那些 ?我好的人。

He was in many ways a father figure to me  when I was in desperate need of one.,某种程度上?， 每?我迫切需要一?父?的?候， 他就在那里。
"Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place,  and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more  to positively influence my worldview  than my own extremist father  is not lost on me.",鼓舞人心之事 往往?自你?法?知的地方， 事?上，一??太裔喜?明星 ?极地影?我的世界?， 比我那极端的?生父? 多得多。
"One day, I had a conversation with my mother  about how my worldview was starting to change,  and she said something to me  that I will hold dear to my heart  for as long as I live.",某天，我和母??到 我的世界?正在改?， 她?我?， 我?在生命里 一直??尊重的心。
"She looked at me with the weary eyes  of someone who had experienced  enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,  ""I'm tired of hating people.""",她用疲倦的眼神看?我， 她受?了 被教?主?侵占的人生， ?到：“我不愿憎恨他人了。”
"In that instant, I realized how much negative energy  it takes to hold that hatred inside of you.",瞬?，我意?到，在?心里承受憎恨 需要多么巨大的?能量。

"Well, that's simple.",嗯，?很容易解?。
"I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday  who is compelled to use violence  may hear my story and realize  that there is a better way,  that although I had been subjected  to this violent, intolerant ideology,  that I did not become fanaticized.",我??做是希望也?某人某天 ?他?定使用武力 反抗社?的?候 可能?听到我的故事，并意?到 有比?武更好的方法， ?管我曾被灌? ??的暴力思?， 偏?的意?， 我并?有?其所?。
"Instead, I choose to use my experience  to fight back against terrorism,  against the bigotry.",而是??通?自己的?? ?抵抗恐怖主?， ?反?偏?。
"I do it for the victims of terrorism  and their loved ones,  for the terrible pain and loss  that terrorism has forced upon their lives.",我?了那些恐怖??的受害者 以及他?的?人而??做， ?了那些被恐怖主?活?所造成的 生命的苦痛和?失而??做。
"For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out  against these senseless acts  and condemn my father's actions.",?了那些遭受恐怖??的 受害者，我站出? 反??些毫?意?的??行?， ??我父?的行?。
"And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof  that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,  and the son does not have to follow  the ways of his father.",就是????的原因， 我站在?里?明 暴力不是宗教或种族与生俱?的， 儿子并不需要走上 和父?相同的道路。

And it has this constant voiceover narrative  in your stream of conscious thinking.,并且它在你的有意?的思?流中 ?有琠w的旁白。
At the heart of this movie is you  experiencing all this directly.,?部?影的核心 是你直接体??一切。
"This movie is your stream of consciousness,  the subject of experience  of the mind and the world.",?部?影是你的意?流， 它是一部?于 ?思想和世界的体??主?的影片。
Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts  of human existence.,意?是人?之所以存在 的基本事?之一。
Each of us is conscious.,我?每?人都是有意?的。
"We all have our own inner movie,  you and you and you.",我?都有自己的?心?影， 包括你、你、?有你。
There's nothing we know about more directly.,?有什么是我?能直接了解的。
"At least, I know about my consciousness directly.",至少，我能直接了解我的意?。

"But at the same time, it's the most  mysterious phenomenon in the universe.",同?，意?也是 最宇宙中最神秘的?象。
Why are we conscious?,?什么我??有意?？
Why do we have these inner movies?,?什么我??有?些?心?影？
"Why aren't we just robots  who process all this input,  produce all that output,  without experiencing the inner movie at all?",?什么我?不只是那种 ?理?入 再?出?果 而不?体?任何?心?影的机器人？
"Right now, nobody knows the answers  to those questions.",目前?止，?有人知道???? 的答案。
"I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness  into science, some radical ideas may be needed.",我想?如果要?意?整合 到科?中去，一些激?的想法也?是需要的。
Some people say a science of consciousness  is impossible.,有人?意?科? 是不可能存在的。
"Science, by its nature, is objective.",科?，?它的本?上?看，是客?的。
"Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.",意?，?它的本?上?看，是主?的。
So there can never be a science of consciousness.,所以，不可能?有意?科?。
"For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.",在20世?的大部分??里，?种??占据?治地位。
"Psychologists studied behavior objectively,  neuroscientists studied the brain objectively,  and nobody even mentioned consciousness.",心理?家客?地研究行??止， 神?科?家客?地研究大?， 但是?有人哪怕是提到意?。
"Even 30 years ago, when TED got started,  there was very little scientific work  on consciousness.",即使30年前，?TED??始?， 也很少?到?于意?方面 的科?研究。
"Now, about 20 years ago,  all that began to change.",大?在20年前， 所有?些都?始改?了。
Neuroscientists like Francis Crick  and physicists like Roger Penrose  said now is the time for science  to attack consciousness.,像弗朗西斯·克里克??的神?科?家 以及像?杰·彭?斯??的物理?家 都??在正是科?向意?方面?攻 的?候。
"And since then, there's been a real explosion,  a flowering of scientific work  on consciousness.",?那以?， ?于意?方面的科?研究 遍地?花。
And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.,??研究很奇妙，很了不起。
But it also has some fundamental  limitations so far.,但是迄今?止它也?有一些 根本的局限性。
"The centerpiece  of the science of consciousness in recent years  has been the search for correlations,  correlations between certain areas of the brain  and certain states of consciousness.",近几年 意?科?研究的核心 是?找相?性， ?于大?的特定?域 和特定的意???之?的相?性。
We saw some of this kind of work  from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work  she presented just a few minutes ago.,我?看了南希·坎?舍 做的一些?方面的研究以及几分?之前 她??提交的精彩工作。
"Now we understand much better, for example,  the kinds of brain areas that go along with  the conscious experience of seeing faces  or of feeling pain  or of feeling happy.",?在我?有了更好的理解，例如， 不同的大??域???不同 的意?体?：人??? 或者感受痛苦 或者感受快?。
But this is still a science of correlations.,但?仍然是?于相?性的科?。
It's not a science of explanations.,?不是意?科?。
"We know that these brain areas  go along with certain kinds of conscious experience,  but we don't know why they do.",我?知道?些大??域 ???特定的意?体?， 但是我?不知道?什么???。
"I like to put this by saying  that this kind of work from neuroscience  is answering some of the questions  we want answered about consciousness,  the questions about what certain brain areas do  and what they correlate with.",我想?的是， 神?科?方面的?种研究 正回答?那些 我?想要回答的?于意?、 ?于某些特定大??域做些什么 以及??哪种的??。
"But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.",但是?某种意?上??，?些都是??的??。
No knock on the neuroscientists.,都不是神?科?家想要研究的。
There are no truly easy problems with consciousness.,?有真正的?于意?的????。
But it doesn't address the real mystery  at the core of this subject:  why is it that all that physical processing in a brain  should be accompanied by consciousness at all?,它?能解??于????的核心 的真正??： ?什么大?中所有的物理?程 必?伴??意?？
Why is there this inner subjective movie?,?什么?有?种?心的主??影的存在？
"Right now, we don't really have a bead on that.",目前?止，我??此??有一???。
"And you might say,  let's just give neuroscience a few years.",也?你??， ?我?再?神?科?几年??。
"It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon  like traffic jams, like hurricanes,  like life, and we'll figure it out.",它?被?明是另一种涌??象， 就像塞?、就像??、 就像生命一?，并且我??弄明白它。
"The classical cases of emergence  are all cases of emergent behavior,  how a traffic jam behaves,  how a hurricane functions,  how a living organism reproduces  and adapts and metabolizes,  all questions about objective functioning.",所有涌??象的?典案例 都是?急行?的表?， 塞?是如何行成的， ??是如何作用的， 生物体是如何繁殖、 适??境和新?代?的， 所有?些??都是?于客?机能的。
"You could apply that to the human brain  in explaining some of the behaviors  and the functions of the human brain  as emergent phenomena:  how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,  all these questions about behavior.",你可以把它?用到人?的大?上 去解??什么人?大?的某些行? 和功能 跟涌??象很像： 我?如何走路，如何??，如何下象棋， 所有?些??都是?于行?的。
"But when it comes to consciousness,  questions about behavior  are among the easy problems.",但是??到意??， ?于行?的?? 只是一???的??。
"When it comes to the hard problem,  that's the question of why is it  that all this behavior  is accompanied by subjective experience?",?涉及到困????， ??就?成了?什么 所有的?些行? 都伴??主?体?。
"And here, the standard paradigm  of emergence,  even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,  don't really, so far, have that much to say.",?此，涌??象 的?准范例， 甚至神?科?的?准范例， 到目前?止都?有太多可以?的。
"Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.",?在，我本?上是一?科?唯物主?者。
"I want a scientific theory of consciousness  that works,  and for a long time, I banged my head  against the wall  looking for a theory of consciousness  in purely physical terms  that would work.",我希望某种?于意?的科?理? 能?奏效， 在?去很?一段??里， 我埋?苦干， 努力?找一种有效的 ??物理的角度去解?的 ?于意?的理?。
But I eventually came to the conclusion  that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.,但我最?得出一???， 那就是它不起作用只是因?系?性的原因。
"It's a long story,  but the core idea is just that what you get  from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms, in brain-based terms,  is stories about the functioning of a system,  its structure, its dynamics,  the behavior it produces,  great for solving the easy problems —  how we behave, how we function —  but when it comes to subjective experience —  why does all this feel like something from the inside? —",????， 但是??故事的核心就是 你?在物理方面，在基于大?方面的 ?粹的?原?者的解?中得到的?西， 是?于一?系?的功能、 它的?构、它的?力、 以及它所?生的行?的， 它可以很好地解?????—— 比如?我?如何表?，我?如何活?—— 但是?它涉及到主?体??—— 比如??什么所有?些都感?像是?自?心的某些?西？——
"that's something fundamentally new,  and it's always a further question.",?是一些全新的?西， 并且它??成?一?更深?次的??。
So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.,因此我想我??入了僵局。
"We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,  we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,  chemistry explains biology,  biology explains parts of psychology.",我?已?有了一套美妙的、?大的解??， 我?已???了它，那就是用用物理解?化?， 用化?解?生物， 用生物解?部分心理?。
But consciousness  doesn't seem to fit into this picture.,但是意? 似乎并不符合?种情形。
"On the one hand, it's a datum  that we're conscious.",一方面，它是一?已知? 即我?是有意?的。
"On the other hand, we don't know how  to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world.",另一方面，我??并不知道 如何使它与我?的科?的世界?相适?。
"So I think consciousness right now  is a kind of anomaly,  one that we need to integrate  into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.",所以我??就目前而言意? 是一种反常事物， 是一种需要我??它整合到 我?的世界?中，而我???不知道如何整合的事物。
"Faced with an anomaly like this,  radical ideas may be needed,  and I think that we may need one or two ideas  that initially seem crazy  before we can come to grips with consciousness  scientifically. Now, there are a few candidates  for what those crazy ideas might be.",面???的反常事物， 我?可能需要一些激?的想法， 并且我??我?可能需要一?? 在我?可以科?地 面?意?之前 看起?很?狂的想法。 ?在，?于?些?狂的想法可能是什么
"My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.",已?有了一些候??。 我的朋友丹·丹尼特就有一???的想法，他今天也在?里。
His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem  of consciousness.,他的?狂想法是?于意? 的困???并不存在。
The whole idea of the inner subjective movie  involves a kind of illusion or confusion.,整??心主??影的想法 涉及一种幻?或困惑。
"Actually, all we've got to do is explain  the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,  and then we've explained everything  that needs to be explained.",事?上，我??在要做的就是解? 客?功能和大?行?， 然后自然地我?就解?了 所有需要被解?的。
"Well I say, more power to him.",我想?，?他更多的能量。
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore  if you want to have a purely reductionist  brain-based theory of consciousness.,?就是那种我?需要去探索的 激?想法， 如果你想?得?于意?的 ??原?者的基于大?的理?的?。
"At the same time, for me and for many other people,  that view is a bit too close to simply  denying the datum of consciousness  to be satisfactory.",同?，?于我和其他很多人??， ????有一?太接近于??地 否??于意?的已知?料 而不能令人?意。
So I go in a different direction.,因此我??了另一?不同的方向。
"In the time remaining,  I want to explore two crazy ideas  that I think may have some promise.",在余下的??里， 我想探???我??可能有希望的 ?狂想法。
The first crazy idea  is that consciousness is fundamental.,第一种?狂想法是 意?是一种基本概念。
Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe  as fundamental building blocks:  space and time and mass.,物理?家有?候?把宇宙中的某些方面 作?基本概念，如： 空?、??和?量。
"They postulate fundamental laws governing them,  like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.",他??定了一些基本定律去管理它?， 例如重力定律和量子力?定律。
These fundamental properties and laws  aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.,?些基本性?和定律 不能解?一些更基?的?西。
"Rather, they're taken as primitive,  and you build up the world from there.",?相?于以它??根本， 然后你在它?的基?上建立??世界。
"Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.",?在，??基本定律名??不??大。
"In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out  that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals —  space, time, mass, Newton's laws —  so he postulated fundamental laws  of electromagnetism  and postulated electric charge  as a fundamental element  that those laws govern.",在19世?，?克斯??定 你?法用??存在的基本概念—— 空?、??、?量、牛?定律—— 去解??磁?象， 因此他?定了?磁?的 基本定律， 并且?定了?荷 作??些定律的 基本元素。
I think that's the situation we're in  with consciousness.,我???与我?在研究意?上的 情形是一?的。
"If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals —  space, time, mass, charge —  then as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.",如果我?不能用?存的基本概念—— ??、空?、?量、?荷—— 去解?意?， 那么???上而言，你需要去?充??名?。
"The natural thing to do is to postulate  consciousness itself as something fundamental,  a fundamental building block of nature.",接下??意?本身?定? 某种根本性的?西， 作?自然界的基本概念就是一件自然而然的事。
This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.,?并不意味?突然?你不能用它?研究科?了。
This opens up the way for you to do science with it.,?反而是?你?僻了一?用它?研究科?的道路。
"What we then need is to study  the fundamental laws governing consciousness,  the laws that connect consciousness  to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,  physical processes.",然后我?需要做的就是研究 那些掌控?意?的基本定律， 那些?意?与其它基本概念—— 空?、??、?量、物理?程—— ?系在一起的定律。
Physicists sometimes say  that we want fundamental laws so simple  that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.,物理?家有?候? 我?希望那些基本定律可以??到 能?把它??在T恤上。
Well I think something like that is the situation  we're in with consciousness.,我想我?在?意?的研究上 也????。
We want to find fundamental laws so simple  we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.,我希望我???的?于意?的基本定律也可以??到 能?把它??在T恤上。
"We don't know what those laws are yet,  but that's what we're after.",我??在?不知道?些定律是什么， 但?是我?正在?找的。
The second crazy idea  is that consciousness might be universal.,第二??狂的想法 是意?也?是普通存在的。
Every system might have some degree  of consciousness.,也?每?系?都有某种程度的 意?。
"This view is sometimes called panpsychism:  pan for all, psych for mind,  every system is conscious,  not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,  but even Rob Knight's microbes,  elementary particles.",?种??有?被?作泛心?： 万物皆有精神或心理活?， 每?系?都具有意?， 不?是人?、狗、老鼠、??， 甚至??伯·奈特的微生物、 基本粒子都具有意?。
Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.,甚至?一?光子都有某种程度的意?。
The idea is not that photons are intelligent  or thinking.,????不是?光子是智能的 或者能思考的。
"It's not that a photon  is wracked with angst  because it's thinking, ""Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light.",不是?一?光子 ?由于焦?而被破坏， 而?种焦?是因?它想?“哦，我?是以接近光速的速度
I never get to slow down and smell the roses.",??地跑?跑去，???有放慢速度??一?玫瑰花香“。
"No, not like that.",不，事情不是??子的。
"But the thought is maybe photons might have  some element of raw, subjective feeling,  some primitive precursor to consciousness.",?种??想要表?的是也?光子可能?有 一些原始的、主?的体?， 一些原始的意?的前兆。
This may sound a bit kooky to you.,?你??，?听起?可能有?怪。
"I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?",我的意思是，?什么不可以有人思考???狂的事呢？
"Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,  that consciousness is fundamental.",有一些?机?自第一??狂想法， 即意?是基本概念。
"If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,  it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,  the way they are.",如果它是基本概念，就像空?、??和?量一?， 那么很自然地可以假定它也可能具有普遍性， 就像其它的基本概念一?。
"It's also worth noting that although the idea  seems counterintuitive to us,  it's much less counterintuitive to people  from different cultures,  where the human mind is seen as much more  continuous with nature.",?有一?值得注意的是?然??想法 ?我???是?反直?的， 但??自其他文化的人?? 可能就不是那么?反直?了， 那些人的心? 跟自然?系在一起的??更?。
A deeper motivation comes from the idea that  perhaps the most simple and powerful way  to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness  to physical processing  is to link consciousness to information.,???想法中得到的一?更深的?机是 也?找出?意?与物理?程 ?系在一起的 最??和最有力的方式 就是?意?与信息相?合。
"Wherever there's information processing,  there's consciousness.",有信息?理的地方 就有意?。
"Complex information processing, like in a human,  complex consciousness.",复?的信息?理，比如?人?的信息?理， 伴??复?的意?。
"Simple information processing,  simple consciousness.",??的信息?理， 伴????的意?。
"A really exciting thing is in recent years  a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,  has taken this kind of theory  and developed it rigorously  with a mathematical theory.",一件令人很??的事是最近几年 有一?神?科?家，朱利?·托?尼 采用了?种理? 并且?格按照??理? 的方式?展了它。
"He has a mathematical measure  of information integration  which he calls phi,  measuring the amount of information  integrated in a system.",他有一??于信息整合 的???量， 他?之?phi， 他用它??量 一?系?中的信息整合的量。
And he supposes that phi goes along  with consciousness.,他推?phi 是与意?相?的。
"So in a human brain,  incredibly large amount of information integration,  high degree of phi,  a whole lot of consciousness.",所以在人?的大?中， 有?令人?以置信的信息整合量， 高度的phi值， 一大堆的意?。
"In a mouse, medium degree of information integration,  still pretty significant,  pretty serious amount of consciousness.",在老鼠的大?中，有中度的信息整合量， 但仍然?目?大， 仍然具有大量的意?。
"But as you go down to worms,  microbes, particles,  the amount of phi falls off.",但是?你?研究目?降至蠕虫、 微生物、粒子， phi的值就?跌落。
"The amount of information integration falls off,  but it's still non-zero.",信息整合量?跌落， 但不??零。
"On Tononi's theory,  there's still going to be a non-zero degree  of consciousness.",在托?尼的理?中， 意?程度 也不?降?零。
"In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law  of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.",事?上，他正在提出??一??于意?的 基本定律：phi值越高，意?度也越高。
"Now, I don't know if this theory is right,  but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now  in the science of consciousness,  and it's been used to integrate a whole range  of scientific data,  and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough  you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.",?在，我不知道??理?是否正确， 但是??上或?它正?于 意?科?的理?前沿， 并且它已?被用于整合 各方面的科??据， 它?有一?很好的?性就是它足???， ??到你可以?它?在T恤上。
Another final motivation is that  panpsychism might help us to integrate  consciousness into the physical world.,另外一?最??机就是 泛心?可以?助我? ?意?和物理世界相?合。
Physicists and philosophers have often observed  that physics is curiously abstract.,物理?家和哲?家?常注意到 物理?是深?抽象的。
"It describes the structure of reality  using a bunch of equations,  but it doesn't tell us about the reality  that underlies it.",它用一?串的方程式 去描述???构， 但是它又不告?我? 构成它的??基?。
"As Stephen Hawking puts it,  what puts the fire into the equations?",正如史蒂芬·霍金所?， 是什么?火放?方程式的？
"Well, on the panpsychist view,  you can leave the equations of physics as they are,  but you can take them to be describing  the flux of consciousness.",而在泛心?者看?， 物理方程可以是它?在的?子， 但是你也可以用它?描述 意?的量。
"That's what physics really is ultimately doing,  describing the flux of consciousness.",?是物理?最?要做的， 描述意?的量。
"On this view, it's consciousness  that puts the fire into the equations.",用?种??看?，是意? ?火放到了方程中。
"On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle  outside the physical world  as some kind of extra.",在那种??看?，意? 不是晃?在物?世界之外 的特?的?西。

"And I think mostly in images,  and so for me that became a key metric --  how to get these mental images  that I use as a way of rapid prototyping,  if you will, my ideas,  trying on different new ideas for size,  playing out scenarios.",我主要是通??像?思考的， 所以?我??最??的， 就是如何找回?些大?中的?像， 因?我是用?像?快速地构建原型想法的。 只要我愿意，我的想法， ???不同?模的新想法， ?想各种?景。
This kind of thinking isn't new.,?种思?方式并不罕?。
Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes  saw things similarly.,哲?家?，像休?、笛卡儿、霍布斯 也是??看事情的。
They thought that mental images and ideas  were actually the same thing.,他????中的?像和思想 是一回事。
"There are those today that dispute that,  and lots of debates about how the mind works,  but for me it's simple:  Mental images, for most of us,  are central in inventive and creative thinking.",?在有很多人?疑?一?， 也有很多?于大?如何思考的??， 但?我??很??： ?大多?人??，大?中的?像 是在?造性思考中?于核心地位。
"So after several years,  I tuned myself up and I have lots of great,  really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication  and the analytical backbone behind them.",在我??了几年之后， 我找到了合适的?物?量， 我?中?始出?了很多栩栩如生 又非常复?的?像， ?有?像中包含的思路。
"And so now I'm working on,  how can I get these mental images in my mind  out to my computer screen faster?",?在我在做的， 就是如何把我?子中的?些?像 更快地?到我的??屏幕上?
"Can you imagine, if you will,  a movie director being able to use  her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?",想像一下， 如果一??影?演?靠她的想象力 就可以?演她眼前的世界?
Or a musician to get the music out of his head?,或者一?音?家??就能把他?子里的音??出??
There are incredible possibilities with this  as a way for creative people  to share at light speed.,?件事有不可思?的可能性， 它可以?有?造性的人? 以??般的速度?分享想法。
"And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck  in being able to do this  is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.",事?上，要???一? ?在剩下的瓶???在于 提高大??描系?的分辨率。
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting there  by sharing with you two recent experiments  from two top neuroscience groups.,?在我要?大家看看， ?什么我?得我?已?接近成功了， 我要展示??近期的??， 分?是在????的?科?研究?做的。
"Both used fMRI technology --  functional magnetic resonance imaging technology --  to image the brain,  and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis  and his colleagues at Harvard.",他?都用了fMRI技? 也就是功能性核磁共振成像技? ??大??行造影。 ?套大??描?是 哈佛的吉?吉?•加尼斯和他的同事?做的。
And the left-hand column shows a brain scan  of a person looking at an image.,左?一列?描的 是一?正看?一??的人的大?。
"The middle column shows the brainscan  of that same individual  imagining, seeing that same image.",中?一列 是同一?人的大??描?， 但他只是在想像看?才那??片，
"And the right column was created  by subtracting the middle column from the left column,  showing the difference to be nearly zero.",右?一列是? 中?的??左?的??去后得到的 可以看出?差?几乎?零。
"This was repeated on lots of different individuals  with lots of different images,  always with a similar result.",????在很多不同的人身上重复?， 而且用了很多不同的?片， ?果几乎?是一?。
The difference between seeing an image  and imagining seeing that same image  is next to nothing.,真正看一??片 和想像看同一??片 之?几乎?有差?。
"Next let me share with you one other experiment,  this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.",下面我再?你?看一???， 是在加州大?伯克利分校 杰克•加?特的??室做的。
They've been able to decode brainwaves  into recognizable visual fields.,他?有?法???波 ??成可??的??。
So let me set this up for you.,我?演示一下。
"In this experiment, individuals were shown  hundreds of hours of YouTube videos  while scans were made of their brains  to create a large library of their brain reacting  to video sequences.",在????里，受?者 要看几百小?的youtube??， 看的?候他?的大??被?描， ??就建立了一?巨大的?据?，里面??下了 他?的大??一系列??的反?，
"Then a new movie was shown with new images,  new people, new animals in it,  and a new scan set was recorded.",然后?他?看一段新??，里面有新的?像， 新的人物，新的?物， 并且新的大??描?也被??下?。
"The computer, using brain scan data alone,  decoded that new brain scan  to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing.",????通?大??描?据 就可以解析新的?描?， 推?出受?者??看到的是什么?像。
"On the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess,  and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.",右?是??的猜?， 而左?是?受?者看的片段。
This is the jaw-dropper.,?真是?人印象极?深刻。
We are so close to being able to do this.,我?离真正???一?已?不?了，
We just need to up the resolution.,只是需要提高分辨率。
"And now remember that when you see an image  versus when you imagine that same image,  it creates the same brain scan.",??住?你看一副?片 或者你想同一副?片?， 大??描的?果是一?的。
"So this was done with the highest-resolution  brain scan systems available today,  and their resolution has increased really  about a thousandfold in the last several years.",?是用?今分辨率最高的 大??描系?做的。 ??系?的分辨率在近几年里 提高了?近一千倍。
Next we need to increase the resolution  another thousandfold  to get a deeper glimpse.,下一步我?需要?分辨率 再提高一千倍， 才能看得更深。
How do we do that?,我?怎???呢？
There's a lot of techniques in this approach.,?方面有很多技?可用。
One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes.,一种方法是把?骨撬?把?极放?去，
I'm not for that.,我不做??。
"There's a lot of new imaging techniques  being proposed, some even by me,  but given the recent success of MRI,  first we need to ask the question,  is it the end of the road with this technology?",?有很多新的成像技?被提出?， 有些?是我提出?的， 不?考?到最近在核磁共振上的成功， 我?首先???的??是， ??技?已??展到??了?？
"Conventional wisdom says the only way  to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,  but at this point bigger magnets  only offer incremental resolution improvements,  not the thousandfold we need.",??的???? 提高分辨率的唯一方法是用更大的磁?， 但是?在更大的磁?只能 ??分辨率的提升只是固定增量的， 不是我?想要的一千倍。
"I'm putting forward an idea:  instead of bigger magnets,  let's make better magnets.",我提出了一?想法： 不用更大的磁?， 我??做更好的磁?。
"There's some new technology breakthroughs  when applied to magnetic structures  that have created a whole new class of magnets,  and with these magnets, we can lay down  very fine detailed magnetic field patterns  throughout the brain,  and using those, we can actually create  holographic-like interference structures  to get precision control over many patterns,  as is shown here by shifting things.",?米科?方面?在有些技?突破， 而用在磁??构上 已?制造出了一种全新?型的磁?。 用?些磁?，我?可以 在整?大?里布置出?构非常?致的磁?模式， 在整?大?里布置出?构非常?致的磁?模式， ??我?就能造出 ?似于全息的干扰?构， 可以?很多模式?行精确控制， 只要像??移?一些?西就行了。
"We can create much more complicated structures  with slightly different arrangements,  kind of like making Spirograph.",我??可以造出更复?的?构， 只要使用稍微不同的排列就可以了。 有?儿像?螺旋?。
So why does that matter?,?有什么用呢？
"A lot of effort in MRI over the years  has gone into making really big,  really huge magnets, right?",?些年?MRI?域很多人 不是在??做出 非常非常大的磁??？
But yet most of the recent advances  in resolution have actually come from  ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions  in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers  in the MRI systems.,但是最近分辨率?域的?步， ??上是源于 MRI系?中 ???波?率?射和接收器 极?精巧的??解?方法。
"Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,  put down structured magnetic patterns  in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.",另外，我?可以不再使用?是一?的磁?， 而是用有一定?构的磁?模式， 再加上???波?率。
So by combining the magnetics patterns  with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies  processing which can massively increase  the information that we can extract in a single scan.,??就?磁?模式 与???波?率模式相?合， 可以极大地增加 我?在一次?描中所提取的信息。
"And on top of that, we can then layer  our ever-growing knowledge of brain structure and memory  to create a thousandfold increase that we need.",除此之外， 我?在大??构和??方面的知?也在不?增加， 我?可以把?些知?整合?去， 就能得到我?想要的1000倍的增?了。
"And using fMRI, we should be able to measure  not just oxygenated blood flow,  but the hormones and neurotransmitters I've talked about  and maybe even the direct neural activity,  which is the dream.",?用fMRI，我?不?可以 ?量?氧的血液流?， ?可以?量我?才?的激素和神???， 甚至有可能直接?量神?活?， 那就是?。
We're going to be able to dump our ideas  directly to digital media.,那?我?就可以把我?的想法 直接下?到?字媒体上。
Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language  and communicate directly with human thought?,想像一下，如果我?可以不借助?言 而直接交流思想？
What would we be capable of then?,那?候我?能有什么?的成就呢？
And how will we learn to deal  with the truths of unfiltered human thought?,我?要怎???面? 未加修?的，完全真?的人?思想呢？
You think the Internet was big.,你?得互?网很大，
These are huge questions.,那?些??就是巨大了。
It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.,把它作?一种工具?放大我?的思考和?通能力，
"And indeed, this very same tool  may prove to lead to the cure  for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.",??想法可能?人?以抗拒。 确?，??方法有可能???治? 阿??海默式症或其它疾病的方法。
We have little option but to open this door.,除了???扇?之外，我?????。
"Regardless, pick a year --  will it happen in five years or 15 years?",不管怎?，??一下， 五年?是十五年之后能??呢？
It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.,很?想像要花更久的??。
We need to learn how to take this step together.,我?要一起??如何一起?出?一步。

Intelligence -- what is it?,智能--它是什么？
"If we take a look back at the history  of how intelligence has been viewed,  one seminal example has been  Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that  ""the question of whether a machine can think  is about as interesting  as the question of whether a submarine  can swim.""",?我?回?在?史上 智能是如何被看待的， 一???性的例子是 艾?格•迪杰斯特拉的著名引述， "?于一台机器能否思考的?? 与?于 一艘?艇是否?游泳的?? 几乎同?有趣"。
"Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,  intended it as a criticism  of the early pioneers of computer science,  like Alan Turing.",?艾?格•迪杰斯特拉 ?下?句?的?候， 他的用意是去批判那些 早年??辟了?算机科?的先?， 比如阿? · ??。
"However, if you take a look back  and think about what have been  the most empowering innovations  that enabled us to build  artificial machines that swim  and artificial machines that [fly],  you find that it was only through understanding  the underlying physical mechanisms  of swimming and flight  that we were able to build these machines.",然而，如果你回??去 并予以思考，有哪些 最有利于?展的?新， ?我?有机?能?制造出 ?游泳的机器 和?[?]的机器， 你???，只有通?了解 游泳和?行 背后的物理机制， 我?才有能力去制造?些机器。
"And so, several years ago,  I undertook a program to try to understand  the fundamental physical mechanisms  underlying intelligence.",所以?，在几年前， 我?手了一??目， ??去了解 智能背后的 基?物理机制。
Let's take a step back.,我?先退一步?。
Let's first begin with a thought experiment.,首先，?我??一?思????始。
"Pretend that you're an alien race  that doesn't know anything about Earth biology  or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,  but you have amazing telescopes  and you're able to watch the Earth,  and you have amazingly long lives,  so you're able to watch the Earth  over millions, even billions of years.",假?你是一?外星人， 你?地球上的生物?、 神?科?和智能一?所知， 但你有?佳的望??， 因此你能?望地球， 你的?命也惊人地?， 所以你可以?察地球 超??百万年，甚至几十?年。
And you observe a really strange effect.,然后你?察到一?很奇怪的?象。
"You observe that, over the course of the millennia,  Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids  up until a point,  and that at some point,  corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,  asteroids that are on  a collision course with the Earth  that otherwise would have collided  mysteriously get deflected  or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.",你?察到，几千年?， 地球不?地与小行星?生碰撞 直到某一刻， 而在那一刻， 大???的是公元2000年， 那些在地球撞??道 上的小行星， 本?相撞 但?被神秘地??了 或者在碰到地球之前就引爆了。
"Now of course, as earthlings,  we know the reason would be  that we're trying to save ourselves.",?然，作?地球人， 我?知道其中的原因是 我?正??自我拯救。
We're trying to prevent an impact.,我?要防止撞??生。
"But if you're an alien race  who doesn't know any of this,  doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,  you'd be forced to put together  a physical theory that explains how,  up until a certain point in time,  asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet  mysteriously stop doing that.",但如果你是一?外星人， ??些一?所知， ?地球上的智能也?有任何概念， ?就迫使你去?? 一种物理理?， 去解?其原因， 直到在某一刻， 本?摧?一?星球表面的小行星， 神秘地停止了?种行?。
And so I claim that this is the same question  as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.,因此我?????? 与理解智能的物理本?的?? 是相同的。
"So in this program that I undertook several years ago,  I looked at a variety of different threads  across science, across a variety of disciplines,  that were pointing, I think,  towards a single, underlying mechanism  for intelligence.",因此，在我几年前?手的 ???目中， 我研究了?多不同的?程， 跨越科?界，跨越多??科， 在我看?，他?都指向 一??一的、?在的 智能机制。
"In cosmology, for example,  there have been a variety of different threads of evidence  that our universe appears to be finely tuned  for the development of intelligence,  and, in particular, for the development  of universal states  that maximize the diversity of possible futures.",例如在宇宙?中， 就存在?各种各?的?索， 它??示我?的宇宙就 ?了智能的??， 而被精准地???， 和特?是的?于?展 世界各? 去??有最大多?化可能性的未?。
"In game play, for example, in Go --  everyone remembers in 1997  when IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess --  fewer people are aware  that in the past 10 years or so,  the game of Go,  arguably a much more challenging game  because it has a much higher branching factor,  has also started to succumb  to computer game players  for the same reason:  the best techniques right now for computers playing Go",在棋牌界，??例子，?棋-- 大家都?得在1997年的?候 IBM制作的机器人“深?“打?了 世界象棋冠?加里·卡斯帕?夫-- 很少有人意?到 在?去10年左右的??里， ?棋， 可以?是一?更具挑?性的游?， 因?它具有更高的分支系?， 也已?始屈服于 ????游??手， 出于同?的原因： ?在，??下?棋的 最佳技?方法
are techniques that try to maximize future options  during game play.,是在下棋的?程中， ??最大化 未?的各种可能性。
"Finally, in robotic motion planning,  there have been a variety of recent techniques  that have tried to take advantage  of abilities of robots to maximize  future freedom of action  in order to accomplish complex tasks.",最后，在机器人的???划中， 有各种各?的新?技?， 它?有??利用 机器人的能力去? 未?的行?自由最大化， ?而完成复?的任?。
"And so, taking all of these different threads  and putting them together,  I asked, starting several years ago,  is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence  that we can factor out  of all of these different threads?",因此，考?所有?些不同的?程 并把它?放在一起， ?几年前?始我就在?， 有?有一种?在的智能机制 可以?我?分解出 所有?些不同的?程？
Is there a single equation for intelligence?,是否存在一? ?于智能的公式？
"And the answer, I believe, is yes. [""F = T ? Sτ""]  What you're seeing is probably  the closest equivalent to an E = mc2  for intelligence that I've seen.",而我相信答案是有。 ["F = T ? SΤ"] 你看到的可能是 我所??最接近于 E = mc2 的智慧。
"So what you're seeing here  is a statement of correspondence  that intelligence is a force, F,  that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.",所以你在?里看到的 是一???表， 其中智能是一种力量，F， 它的作用是?了便于?未?的 行?自由最大化。
"It acts to maximize future freedom of action,  or keep options open,  with some strength T,  with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,  up to some future time horizon, tau.",它的作用是?未?的 行?自由最大化， 或是保留?活的???， 与一种力量 T， 和有多种可能性的、 可??的未?，S， 一直到某?未?的?始， tau。
"In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.",?而言之，智能不喜?被困住。
Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action  and keep options open.,智能???未?的行?自由最大化， 并保留???。
"And so, given this one equation,  it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?",所以，?于?一公式， 你自然??， 那么?些可以?你做什么？
How predictive is it?,它是??性有多高？
Does it predict human-level intelligence?,它能否??人?的智能水平？
Does it predict artificial intelligence?,它能???人工智能?？
"So I'm going to show you now a video  that will, I think, demonstrate  some of the amazing applications  of just this single equation.",因此，我?要展示?你?一段??， 我??，它?展示出 ?是?一?公式的 一些惊人的?用。
"Narrator: Recent research in cosmology  has suggested that universes that produce  more disorder, or ""entropy,"" over their lifetimes  should tend to have more favorable conditions  for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves.",?述人： 宇宙?的最近研究 反?了那些?生更多混?、 或者"熵"的宇宙， 在他?的生命中 ???向于?生更多 有利的情?， ?像我???的智慧生物 得以存在。
But what if that tentative cosmological connection  between entropy and intelligence  hints at a deeper relationship?,但假如那?在熵与智能之? ?定的宇宙?接 暗示?更深?的?系呢？
"What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate  with the production of long-term entropy,  but actually emerges directly from it?",如果智能的行?不?只与 ?期熵的生?相?， 而是直接由其?生的呢？
"To find out, we developed a software engine  called Entropica, designed to maximize  the production of long-term entropy  of any system that it finds itself in.",?了找到答案， 我???了一??件引擎 ?? Entropica， ??的意?是? ?期熵的生?最大化， ??它身在任何系??。
"Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass  multiple animal intelligence tests, play human games,  and even earn money trading stocks,  all without being instructed to do so.",惊人的是，Entropica 通?了 多??物的智能??、 玩人?的游?、 甚至在股票交易中??， 而且完全?有被?出那些指示。
Here are some examples of Entropica in action.,下面是一些 Entropica 的行??例。
"Just like a human standing upright without falling over,  here we see Entropica  automatically balancing a pole using a cart.",就像人?站立不?跌到， ?里我?可以看到 Entropica 自?地使用?物?去平衡棍子。
This behavior is remarkable in part  because we never gave Entropica a goal.,?种行?可以?是非常卓越的 因?我??未? Entropica ?定一?目?。
It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.,它自己就?定去平衡那根棍子。
This balancing ability will have appliactions  for humanoid robotics  and human assistive technologies.,?种平衡能力?能?用于 人形机器人 和人?的?助科技。
"Just as some animals can use objects  in their environments as tools  to reach into narrow spaces,  here we see that Entropica,  again on its own initiative,  was able to move a large disk representing an animal  around so as to cause a small disk,  representing a tool, to reach into a confined space  holding a third disk  and release the third disk from its initially fixed position.",正如一些?物可以使用 ?境中的物体作?工具 去伸入?窄的空?， ?里我?可以看到 Entropica， 同?是自主的， 能?移?一?表示?物的大?? 去把一?表示工具的小??， 去深入一??窄的空?， 那里有第三???， 并把第三????它初始 的??解放出?.
This tool use ability will have applications  for smart manufacturing and agriculture.,?种工具的使用能力?能?用于 智能制造?和??。
"In addition, just as some other animals  are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope  at the same time to release food,  here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish  a model version of that task.",此外，正如其他一些?物 能?合作起?同?去拉 一根?子的?端 ?而?放食物， ?里我?可以看到 Entropica 有能力完成 ??任?的模型版本。
This cooperative ability has interesting implications  for economic planning and a variety of other fields.,?种合作能力能???有趣的影?， 在???划和各种其他?域中。
Entropica is broadly applicable  to a variety of domains.,Entropica 可以?泛适用于 各种各?的?域。
"For example, here we see it successfully  playing a game of pong against itself,  illustrating its potential for gaming.",例如，在?里我?看到它成功的 与自己玩乒乓球游?， ?明其在游?界的?力。
Here we see Entropica orchestrating  new connections on a social network  where friends are constantly falling out of touch  and successfully keeping the network well connected.,在?里我?看到 Entropica 指?? 社交网?上新的?系， 在?朋友?不?的失去?系 并成功地保持有效的网??接。
"This same network orchestration ability  also has applications in health care,  energy, and intelligence.",?种相同的网?指?能力 在??保健、能源、和智能方面 都有相?的?用。
"Here we see Entropica directing the paths  of a fleet of ships,  successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal  to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic  to the Pacific.",?里我?可以看到 Entropica 指?一支??的路?， 成功地??并利用巴拿??河， 然后?其范??大西洋到太平洋 全球性地?大。
"By the same token, Entropica  is broadly applicable to problems  in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.",同?的，Entropica 可以?泛地适用于 自主防御、 物流和??地?用。
"Finally, here we see Entropica  spontaneously discovering and executing  a buy-low, sell-high strategy  on a simulated range traded stock,  successfully growing assets under management  exponentially.",最后，在?里我?看到 Entropica 自主地??和?行 一?低?高?的策略， ?是在模?的范?交易股票上， 它成功地?其管理的?? 成指?升?。
This risk management ability  will have broad applications in finance  and insurance.,?种??管理的能力 ?在金融和保??域 有?泛的?用。
"Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen  is that a variety of signature human intelligent  cognitive behaviors  such as tool use and walking upright  and social cooperation  all follow from a single equation,  which drives a system  to maximize its future freedom of action.",阿?克斯•?斯?-格?斯： 你?看到的 是各种具有代表性的人?智能 的?知行?， 例如工具的使用、直立行走 和社?合作， 它?都遵循一?公式， ?公式所??的系? 是要?其未?的行?自由最大化。
"Now, there's a profound irony here.",?在，?里存在一?深刻的?刺。
"Going back to the beginning  of the usage of the term robot,  the play ""RUR,""  there was always a concept  that if we developed machine intelligence,  there would be a cybernetic revolt.",回到最初， 机器人????的用法， "RUR，"?出?， ?存在一种概念就是 如果我???了机器智能 就??生一?人工智能的叛?。
The machines would rise up against us.,机器??起反抗我?。
"One major consequence of this work  is that maybe all of these decades,  we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt  in reverse.",??工作的主要成果之一 就是也??几十年?， 我??于人工智能的叛? 的整?概念 是?倒的。
It's not that machines first become intelligent  and then megalomaniacal  and try to take over the world.,机器不是先有了智慧 然后才?得狂妄 并??接管世界的。
"It's quite the opposite,  that the urge to take control  of all possible futures  is a more fundamental principle  than that of intelligence,  that general intelligence may in fact emerge  directly from this sort of control-grabbing,  rather than vice versa.",其?几乎是相反的， 那种迫切的欲望， 想要控制所有未?的所有可能 是比智能更基本的 一?原?， ?合智能事?上可能是? ?种控制欲中直接?生的， 而不是反之。
Another important consequence is goal seeking.,另一?重要的成果是?找目?。
"I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals  follow from this sort of framework?",我?常被?道， ?找目?的能力 怎么?遵循?种框架?构呢？
"And the answer is, the ability to seek goals  will follow directly from this  in the following sense:  just like you would travel through a tunnel,  a bottleneck in your future path space,  in order to achieve many other  diverse objectives later on,  or just like you would invest  in a financial security,  reducing your short-term liquidity  in order to increase your wealth over the long term,  goal seeking emerges directly",答案是，?找目?的能力 ?直接遵循它， 道理是??的： 就像你要穿?一?隧道， 你未?道路空?中的一?瓶?， ?了在以后???多 其他的各种目?， 或者就像你?投? 于金融?券， ?少你的短期流?性 ?而??的增加你的?富， 目?的?求直接涌?于
from a long-term drive  to increase future freedom of action.,?期的??， ?了增加未?的行?自由。
"Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,  once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed  and you could pass only a single concept  on to our descendants  to help them rebuild civilization,  that concept should be  that all matter around us  is made out of tiny elements  that attract each other when they're far apart  but repel each other when they're close together.",最后，理查德 · ?曼， ?位著名的物理?家， 曾??道， 如果人?文明被摧? 并且你只能?一?概念 ?承?我?的后代， ??助他?重建文明， ??概念??是 我?身?的一切物? 都是由微小的元素?成的， 它?之?距离?的?候 ?相互吸引， 但在靠的很近? 它??互相排斥。
"My equivalent of that statement  to pass on to descendants  to help them build artificial intelligences  or to help them understand human intelligence,  is the following:  Intelligence should be viewed  as a physical process  that tries to maximize future freedom of action  and avoid constraints in its own future.",我与?句?等同的?明， ????后代， ?助他?建立人工智能 或是?助他?理解 人?的智慧， 是如下的?： 智能??被看作是 一?物理?程， 它???未?的行?自由最大化 并且避免在自己的未?中的?束。
Thank you very much.,非常感?。
