*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> very much <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Bob</COREF> .
There could be <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">verdicts today in three different court cases relating to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the State 's</COREF> contested presidential election in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF></COREF> and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the verdicts</COREF> are believed *-1 to comprise <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Vice President Al Gore 's</COREF> last chance *PRO* to win <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> by *PRO* reversing <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">George W Bush 's</COREF> election day victory .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Corespondent Nick Semion</COREF> reports from <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Tallahassee where the most closely watched ruling could come from <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's</COREF> Supreme Court</COREF> *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's</COREF> highest court</COREF> must decide whether *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">overturn</COREF> a strongly ordered lower court decision that *T*-2 firmly rejected <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Vice President Gore 's</COREF> request for a hand recount of thousands of .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> campaign</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> would amount to *PRO* rewriting <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> election law and that no evidence *ICH*-1 exists that any voter was denied *-2 the right *PRO* to cast the ballot .
In two separate cases , lower courts are considering <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">a demand *ICH*-1 by <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT" S_OFF="4">pro-Gore</COREF> voters</COREF> that thousands of absentee ballots be thrown *-2 out because Republican party workers were allowed *-3 to adjust ballot applications</COREF> .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> campaign</COREF> attorney Matthew Staber says 0 the solution should not be *PRO* to penalize the wrong people .
When we look at <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the remedy that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are requesting *T*-1</COREF> *T*-2 , even the disenfranchisement of one voice in this case is a price too high 0 *PRO* to pay *T*-3 .
While all this is going on , the Republican leaders of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's</COREF> legislature <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">begin</COREF> a special session Friday , *PRO* to appoint <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> 25 electors , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">a move designed * *PRO* to ensure that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">George W Bush</COREF> is guaranteed *-1 enough electoral votes *PRO*-1 to win <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF></COREF> .
