<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">The United Nations</COREF> and <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the government of Indonesia</COREF> are trying *PRO*-1 to work out <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">a plan 0 *T*-2 to do <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> , as <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">VOA 's</COREF> Breck Ardery</COREF> reports *?* from <COREF ID="VOA20001121.0500.0871.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the UN</COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Namibia 's <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> Ambassador</COREF> <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Martin Angava</COREF> who *T*-1 recently lead <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">a seven member Security Council delegation to <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">East Timor</COREF> and to <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Indonesia</COREF></COREF></COREF> , told reporters 0 <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> involves <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">a joint security assessment of conditions in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the camps</COREF></COREF> .
What we have proposed *T*-1 and <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the government of Indonesia</COREF> is willing *PRO*-2 to embark on discussions with the <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> officials in Jakarta is for <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> security experts to be sent *-3 to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the camps</COREF> and to assess <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the situation , and of course , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">East Timor perhaps as a whole</COREF></COREF> , to assess <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the situation</COREF> , together with the Indonesian military and police , and it would be on the basis of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">their assessment</COREF> that a decision *ICH*-5 would then be taken *-4 as to whether <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the humanitarian agents</COREF> should go back to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">West Timor</COREF> or not *T*-6 .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Angava</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the government of Indonesia</COREF> has increased <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">security in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the refugee camps</COREF></COREF> since September .
There are tens of thousands of refugees from <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">East Timor</COREF> in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the camps</COREF> , but the exact number is in dispute .
International relief workers were evacuated *-1 from <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">West Timor</COREF> after <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">an incident on September 6th , in which three <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> aid workers were killed *-2 *T*-3</COREF> .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">The Indonesian government</COREF> has arrested six people in connection with <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the murders</COREF> .
The situation in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the refugee camps of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">West Timor</COREF></COREF> has been an ongoing source of concern for the <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">UN</COREF> transitional administration in <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">East Timor</COREF> that *T*-1 is helping *PRO* to prepare <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">that territory</COREF> for independence .
Numbers of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">anti-independence militia groups</COREF> have been intimidating refugees and even sometimes crossing over into <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">East Timor</COREF> .
Despite the increased presence of <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Indonesian security forces</COREF> in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the camps</COREF> , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Ambassador Angava</COREF> says 0 *?* , there is evidence 0 <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">the militias</COREF> still have a lot of influence .
