<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">VOA 's</COREF> Greg Flankis</COREF> reports from <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Quito</COREF> , 0 while <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> is working , economists still see some problems ahead .
*PRO*-1 Driving through the narrow streets of downtown Quito , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">taxi driver Abdun Mesios</COREF> has nothing but praise for <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the dollarization of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> country 's</COREF> economy</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 things are more stable now and that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the transition from <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the former currency known * as the sucre</COREF></COREF> has not been difficult .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says that <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">people who *T*-1 work with the public</COREF> are having *-2 to make change everyday and so <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> learned fast how *PRO* to work with the money from <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> *T*-3 .
When <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the six month transition</COREF> ended last month and all transactions in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador</COREF> moved to <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar system</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">many merchants</COREF> found 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were short of change .

<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> happens all the time and that <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> loses money because <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't have enough coins *PRO*-1 to make change .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The Ecuadorian government</COREF> has minted coins that *T*-1 resemble US coins in an effort *PRO* to provide more small change for merchants , but it *EXP*-2 has taken some time * to reach all areas , in small rural communities in the countryside , because not enough dollars have made it into circulation there , but <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> and <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">President Gustavo Nobora</COREF> considers these to be short - term problems and views <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the overall policy</COREF> as a grand success .
Most people in the financial community agree .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Economist Maria Delapasvela , who *T*-1 works with <COREF ID="100" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the magazine</COREF> <COREF ID="100" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rabista Hastion</COREF></COREF> says 0 *PRO* <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">adopting</COREF> <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the US dollar</COREF> has put an end to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador 's</COREF> crisis atmosphere characterized * by runs on banks and other disruptions .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the immediate effect of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the dollarization</COREF></COREF> has been the stabilization of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says 0 1998 and 1999 were years in which <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador</COREF> suffered the worst economic crisis in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> history *T*-1 .
During that time , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> notes 0 *?* , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the sucre</COREF> went from just over 6,000 to the dollar to almost 25,000 to the dollar .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Maria Delapasvela</COREF> says 0 * conducting business in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador</COREF> had become a real challenge as <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">factory and storeowners</COREF> needed *-1 to keep an eye on currency fluctuation almost on an hourly basis in order *PRO*-1 to plan <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> purchases and sales .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says 0 inflation is now on the decline and bank deposits are increasing .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">The transition to dollars</COREF> was eased *-1 somewhat by a sharp increase in oil prices in the past year , which *T*-2 allowed <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">oil - producing Ecuador</COREF> to buy plenty of dollars on the international market , but <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Maria Delapasvela</COREF> says 0 now is *T*-3 the time 0 *PRO* to start *-7 thinking about what *T*-4 happens when the situation changes *T*-6 *T*-5 .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> asks what *T*-1 will happen when oil prices go back down and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> can no longer bring in sufficient dollars *-2 to sustain <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> economy</COREF> *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">The Ecuadorian economist</COREF> says 0 now is *T*-1 the time for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> to implement fiscal reforms and to stimulate competitiveness and diversification in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Nobora</COREF> government</COREF> is rightfully proud of <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the immediate short - term effects of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> dollarization policy</COREF></COREF> , but that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> needs *-1 to concentrate on the medium and long - term outlook .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says , 0 unless <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> develops a plan *ICH*-1 soon * to address <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador 's</COREF> fundamental structural problems , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the use of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the US dollar</COREF> as a medium of exchange</COREF> will not be enough *PRO* to keep <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> economy</COREF> *PRO*-2 healthy .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">The experiment in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador</COREF></COREF> is being watched *-1 closely not only by <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the United States , which *T*-2 receives a certain benefit from the increased demand for dollars</COREF> , but by other nations in the region .
<COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">The concept of dollarization</COREF> has been discussed *-1 from Argentina to Mexico in the past few years .
Some US economists , in fact , had viewed <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador</COREF> as a poor place 0 * to test <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the idea</COREF> *T*-1 since <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> economy</COREF> is still burdened *-2 by heavy external debt and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> export sector is relatively undeveloped .
Still , as one observer puts it , officials in some nations may conclude that if <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">dollarization</COREF> can work here in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador</COREF> , <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can work anywhere .
