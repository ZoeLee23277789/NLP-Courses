<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">US Energy Secretary Bill Richardson</COREF> has <COREF ID="VOA20001220.2000.3038.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">extended</COREF> <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">an emergency order *PRO* to keep electricity flowing to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The measure</COREF> will require western suppliers *PRO*-1 to sell power to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> for at least another week .
As we hear *?* from <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Michael Sullivan</COREF> , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the official</COREF> also <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">proposed</COREF> an energy price cap for <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the West</COREF> , but <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the suggestion</COREF> had a mixed response from western governors .
<COREF ID="VOA20001220.2000.3038.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">The extension of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the federal order</COREF></COREF> will require <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">power suppliers in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the West</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-1 to keep *-2 sending <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> surplus electricity to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Electrical resources in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the West Coast state</COREF></COREF> are stretched *-1 to <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> limit with a looming threat of rolling blackouts .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California 's</COREF> utility companies</COREF> are not able *PRO*-1 to generate all the power 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> customers need *T*-2 , so <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have turned to outside suppliers and in the face of rising prices <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> two largest utility firms have sunk more than eight billion dollars in debt .
Suppliers outside <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> had threatened *PRO*-1 to cut off <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the power</COREF> , *PRO*-1 afraid that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the cash - strapped utilities</COREF> were not able *PRO*-2 to pay for <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The emergency order <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF></COREF> and <COREF ID="VOA20001220.2000.3038.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the extension announced * in Denver at a meeting of western governors</COREF> will keep electricity flowing to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> through the middle of next week .
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">The crisis</COREF> began three years ago when <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> imposed <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">a price freeze</COREF> on <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> private utility firms *PRO* to protect consumers while <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> deregulates <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> energy sector *T*-1 , but the lifting of market controls led to wild price fluctuations on the wholesale market .
This was made *-1 worse by several factors .
No new generating stations have been built *-1 in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> in recent years and some existing generators are offline for repairs .
At the same time <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> has been growing .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Energy Secretary Bill Richardson</COREF> says 0 it is a case of demand outpacing supplies .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know 0 in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California alone</COREF> in the last year electricity demand has increased 13 % .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California 's</COREF> wholesale electricity prices , which *T*-1 had been capped *-2 at 250 dollars per megawatt hour in a regulated market , have peaked under deregulation at 1400 dollars per megawatt hour .
With <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the current price freeze</COREF> , utilities have been prevented *-1 from *PRO*-1 passing along the increase to consumers .
Wednesday , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Energy Secretary Bill Richardson</COREF> suggested <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">a new price cap for electricity throughout the western states</COREF> .
Oregon 's Governor supports <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the idea</COREF> .
Some other western leaders are not convinced that a price cap will solve the problem .
<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">Energy suppliers</COREF> oppose a cap , *PRO*-1 saying instead 0 <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need incentives *PRO* to build more generating stations .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Last week</COREF> federal regulators imposed <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">a so - called soft cap *ICH*-1</COREF> on <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> , which *T*-2 requires <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">power firms</COREF> *PRO*-3 to justify prices above <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">150 dollars per megawatt hour</COREF> .
<COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">The measure</COREF> does not however prevent <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> from *PRO*-1 charging above <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">that level</COREF> .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">One large utility company</COREF> , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Southern California Edison</COREF></COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> may have *-1 to file for bankruptcy unless government officials can offer some relief .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">The privately owned company</COREF> is now three and a half billion dollars in debt .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Consumer activists</COREF> are skeptical .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the utility</COREF> recently declared a dividend for <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> stockholders , but <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Edison 's</COREF> Tom Higgins says 0 <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the firm</COREF> can not continue *-1 to pay high prices for electricity while *PRO*-2 keeping prices *PRO*-3 low for <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> customers .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> books are an open matter .
It 's not hard 0 for <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">anybody</COREF> to see *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> can talk to the banks <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> and see that you know , clearly <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't have the ability *PRO*-1 to do this .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do n't print money in the basement .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">California 's</COREF> Governor this week warned that intermittent cutoffs of power around <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> may begin as early as next week if nothing more is done *-1 *PRO* to alleviate <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the crisis</COREF> .
