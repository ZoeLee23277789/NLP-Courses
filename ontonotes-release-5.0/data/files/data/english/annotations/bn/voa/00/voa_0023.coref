This is <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">VOA</COREF> News now .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">A new and simple blood test</COREF> *ICH*-3 may soon be available 0 *T*-4 to help <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">doctors</COREF> tell which of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> diabetic patients *T*-1 is most likely *-2 to develop crippling and life - threatening complications .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">VOA 's</COREF> Jessica Berman explains .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Researcher Andrew Levi</COREF> says 0 scientists have long been puzzled *-2 by the question of which diabetics *T*-1 develop <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">complications</COREF> and why .
We know that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the complications</COREF> are directly related to a couple of things .
One is how long you 've had <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the diabetes</COREF> *T*-1 , how well you 've been controlled *-2 *T*-3 , but it *EXP*-4 's clear that <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">people with the same level of control of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> glucose , same duration of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the diabetes</COREF></COREF> differ dramatically in <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> susceptibility to <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">these complications that *T*-5 are so devastating</COREF> .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Levi</COREF> says 0 one third of insulin taking patients ends up with kidney failure and 80 % develop blinding eye disease .
Scientists have suspected 0 there must be <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">something different about the genetic make - up of diabetics who *T*-1 develop complications</COREF> ; and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">that difference</COREF> may have *-3 to do with <COREF ID="VOA20001008.2100.2700.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">haptoglobin</COREF> , <COREF ID="VOA20001008.2100.2700.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a protein whose function *T*-2 is *PRO* to mop up <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">blood vessel destroying free radicals</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">The free radicals</COREF> are released *-1 when oxygen carrying red blood cells called * *PRO*-2 haemoglobin die *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Andrew Levi</COREF> says 0 there are three different types of haptoglobin and <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> colleagues at <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Israel 's Technion Institute</COREF></COREF> have found that one type of haptoglobin called * *PRO*-1 Type 1 - 1 appears *-2 protective against diabetic complications while the other two types do not *?* .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Researchers at <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Technion Institute</COREF> led * by <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Levi</COREF></COREF> have developed <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">a simple blood test 0 *T*-1 to let doctors and patients know who *T*-2 is most likely *-3 to develop diabetic complications</COREF> .
