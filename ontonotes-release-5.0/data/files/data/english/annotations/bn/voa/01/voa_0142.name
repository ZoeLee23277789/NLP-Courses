Ebola virus is one of the most feared in the world .
The deadly disease periodically attacks <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">African</ENAMEX> villages and kills <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">up to 90 %</ENAMEX> of those infected .
Now , a team of researchers led by scientists at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Institutes of Health</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Bethesda</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> has developed a vaccine that prevents Ebola virus infections in monkeys .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Garry Nabal</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NIH</ENAMEX> says , the experiment with the new vaccine involved giving <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> monkeys the Ebola virus , then injecting them with a placebo immunization , which has no effect .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Four</ENAMEX> other monkeys were infected with the Ebola virus DNA and then were injected with a vaccine called Ebola - Adnia virus booster .
In the animals that received the control vaccine , i.e. the same vectors , but not expressing the virus proteins , all of the animals had died within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</ENAMEX> after challenge .
In contrast , the animals who received the DNA plus the Adnia viral vector that made the viral proteins , not only survived the challenge , but they continued to be symptom - free for over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> , the time point that they were followed .
Scientists must do far more research on this vaccine before a version of it might be used to prevent the disease in humans .
