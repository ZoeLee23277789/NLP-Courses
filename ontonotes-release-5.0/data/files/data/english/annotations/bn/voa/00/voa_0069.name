The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">US Navy</ENAMEX> destroyer damaged apparently by a terrorist bomb while refueling at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Red Sea</ENAMEX> port , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> has begun its journey back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">States</ENAMEX> for repair .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Gavlak</ENAMEX> reports , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the US Cole</ENAMEX> was towed out of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Aden Harbor</ENAMEX> to a waiting <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Norwegian</ENAMEX> transport ship , that will actually carry the damaged destroyer home .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> national anthem played as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> tug boats pulled <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the USS Cole</ENAMEX> slowly out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> 's southern port of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Aden</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> was badly damaged <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</ENAMEX> in an apparent suicide bombing that killed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">17</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> sailors .
Security was tight as the ship was towed out .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> patrol boats mounted with machine guns escorted the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> out to open waters while <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> helicopters flew overhead .
Some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemenis</ENAMEX> expressed relief to see the ship leave .
Many locals said they feared the bombing of the ship would serve as an excuse for continued <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military presence in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Gulf</ENAMEX> country .
Diplomats and analysts have commented that a joint investigation into the attack may in fact strengthen ties between the world super power and the poor , but strategic <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> state .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> officials say they believe <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> militants may have carried out the bombing .
So far <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> little known <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> groups have claimed responsibility for the attack .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yemeni</ENAMEX> authorities claimed they have detained <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">over 70</ENAMEX> people for questioning .
These include some <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Afghan - Arab</ENAMEX> volunteers who came to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> after fighting against <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> forces in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> .
