<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The Legend of Bagger Vance directed * by Robert Redford</COREF> is the latest movie 0 *T*-1 to bring the game of golf to the screen and is one of the most popular attractions of theaters in the United States .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Entertainment reporter Chuck Rich</COREF> discussed <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and previous golf films with <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">VOA 's Dave Arlington</COREF> .
<COREF ID="VOA20001117.2000.1387.mrg-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The movies</COREF> <COREF ID="VOA20001117.2000.1387.mrg-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">' The Natural ' and ' Field of Dreams '</COREF> brought mystical and nostalgic qualities to baseball and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The Legend of Bagger Vance , set * during the economic depression over the 1920s and 1930s</COREF> , does the same thing for golf .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Will Smith</COREF> plays a caddy who *T*-1 revives the confidence , as well as the skill of a golfer whose glory *T*-2 has faded .
You know <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> understood everything 0 <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Will Smith</COREF> said *T*-1 in films like '' Men in Black '' and '' Independence Day . ''
What was <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> talking about *T*-1 there ?
*PRO* Beats the heck out of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
Seriously , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">golf and many golf films</COREF> can be whatever you interpret <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to be *T*-2 , what the player or the moviegoer decides 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll be *T*-3 .
Some people consider <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">golf</COREF> to be a silly and dull game , *PRO* following a little ball around the course , others , including some filmmakers , view <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as a symbol or as a gauge of a person 's philosophy or psychology .
For example in <COREF ID="VOA20001117.2000.1387.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the 1996 movie</COREF> <COREF ID="VOA20001117.2000.1387.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">'' Tin Cup '' with Kevin Costner and Cheech Merrin</COREF> , what *T*-1 might be an embarrassing experience in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">one golfer 's</COREF> past is for <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a badge of honor .
Do you have *-1 to <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">like</COREF> golf *PRO*-1 to like golf movies ?
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> helps , but <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not necessary .
Some filmmakers and performers used <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">golf</COREF> as a setting for broad comedy with potential appeal both inside and outside of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the sport</COREF> .
<COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="VOA20001117.2000.1387.mrg-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The 1996 golf movie</COREF> <COREF ID="VOA20001117.2000.1387.mrg-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">'' Happy Gilmore ''</COREF> starring *RNR*-1 and co-written * by *RNR*-1 Adam Sandler</COREF> , placed the temperamental ice hockey player in a professional sport that some people consider *T*-2 refined .
Golf can be a very frustrating game .
So , any golfer <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess 0 *?* would understand that gag in <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">'' Happy Gilmore</COREF> . ''
And anyone who *T*-1 dislikes *RNR*-2 or is bored *-5 by *RNR*-2 <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">golf</COREF> , might appreciate *PRO*-3 seeing <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the game</COREF> played *-4 for laughs there .
What is <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> take on golf movies *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> only play miniature golf and <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't watch golf on television .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am one of the people 0 <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">filmmakers</COREF> are thinking of *T*-1 , when <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> try *PRO*-2 to give a golf movie wide appeal , humor , or a love story for example *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">One film that *T*-1 's attracted a lot of golf loving fans over the years</COREF> is 1980 's '' Caddy Shack '' .
*PRO*-1 Set *-2 at the exclusive Bush Wood country club , <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's about <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">class conflict</COREF> or as movie advertising sometimes calls <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">the snobs versus the flops</COREF> .
Here is *T*-1 one golfer in <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">'' Caddy Shack ''</COREF> played * by <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">Rodney Dangerfield</COREF> , bothering <COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">another</COREF> , <COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a judge played * by the late Ted Night</COREF> .
As a comedian , <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">Rodney Dangerfield</COREF> often says 0 <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets no respect , but were n't <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the filmmakers</COREF> really showing <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> respect for <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> drawing power by *PRO*-1 casting <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">this film</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">Dangerfield</COREF> was a big selling point who *T*-1 attracted a lot of <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fans , who *T*-2 include <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , *PRO*-4 to see <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">'' Caddy Shack</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a very good film , but <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a popular one and <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">the music in <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">'' Caddy Shack ''</COREF></COREF> got some attention too .
<COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're going *-1 to finish up <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> cinematic round of golf with some of <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Chuck</COREF> .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> 're welcome , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Dave</COREF> .
