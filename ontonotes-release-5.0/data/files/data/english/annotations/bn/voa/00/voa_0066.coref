*PRO* Let 's go to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Russia *ICH*-1</COREF> right now <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Joe</COREF> , where <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Vladimir Putin who *T*-2 still remains something of an enigmatic presence in the Russian political scene since <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took office at the beginning of the year 2000</COREF> , is apparently under siege *ICH*-7 yet again by <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">revelations that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> might possibly have been able *PRO*-3 to rescue <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">those trapped sailors in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the Kursk submarine</COREF></COREF> because <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">some of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> evidently survived and it 's apparent that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian military</COREF> suppressed <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">information about what *T*-4 had happened</COREF> or even distorted <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and was singularly slow in *PRO*-5 taking up offers of assistance from <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the Norwegians and the British</COREF> *PRO* to help</COREF> *T*-6 .
What impact *ICH*-2 do <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this new revelation</COREF> has *T*-1 on <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Putin 's</COREF> political stature ?
Oh , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is another step in a diminution of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 a number of things have happened ;
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> attempt *PRO* to restore the image of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Russia as a great power</COREF> has been , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think backfired generally .
The <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> plunged <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> long after it *EXP*-1 was clear that <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was finished *-2 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has tried *PRO*-1 to form a strategic relationship with China and India , but this <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 *?* has reflected in a much more dramatic way , the weakness of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> .
After all , you 've got *-1 to remember that when <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the Kursk</COREF> <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">went</COREF> down *T*-2 , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was on vacation in the Black Sea and did n't bother even *PRO*-3 to come back to Moscow , let alone going to Mermonsk at the scene of <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the disaster</COREF> and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="VOA20001028.2100.2746.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">held</COREF> back for days before <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> requested help from <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Norwegian and British experts</COREF> and those kind of thing , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that there is a sense that <COREF ID="VOA20001028.2100.2746.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> may have contributed to <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the disaster</COREF> .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Tom</COREF> , what 's the thinking in <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Putin 's</COREF> performance so far *T*-1 ?
Very disappointing .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> , it *EXP*-1 's clear 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is no new style Democrat , *PRO* to put it mildly .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is a man who *T*-1 still behaves like a KGB operator *ICH*-2 rather than a ... which , of course , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was *T*-3 .
Yeah , for many , many years at a high level , than a President of a country trying *PRO* to grapple with democracy .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the Clinton administration</COREF> <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was hopeful for <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Boris Yeltsin</COREF> and then <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> got disappointed in <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Yeltsin</COREF> and then <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> thought that reluctantly <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Putin</COREF> was a man that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could do business with *T*-1 , *PRO* to coin former Prime Minister of Britain Margaret Thatcher 's phrase about Mikhail Gorbachov , but <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> <COREF ID="VOA20001028.2100.2746.mrg-E6" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> disappointing <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the United States government</COREF> .
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> wo n't say <COREF ID="VOA20001028.2100.2746.mrg-E6" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> of course , but <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has turned out *-1 to be a disappointment , and <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> agree with <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Joe</COREF> , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">these latest revelations that <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">23 sailors on <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the Kursk</COREF></COREF> survived several days and theoretically might have been saved *-2 , had <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the Russians</COREF> gotten off the dime and asked for help sooner</COREF> , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think are devastating .
And David , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it *ICH*-4 's important 0 the views that <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 *T*-1 is gaining headway in <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the Administration</COREF> and voiced *-5 generally is that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> is a bureaucrat and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> runs <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> in a bureaucratic kind of way and that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has no chance whatever of *PRO*-2 rebuilding the Russian economy and the Russian political stability , and that a continuing decline appears *-3 to be in the cards for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF> under <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> leadership .
