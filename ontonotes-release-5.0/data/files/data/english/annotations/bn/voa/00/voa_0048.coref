*PRO* Thank you and Goodday .
More deadly violence has erupted in the West Bank as <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Israel 's</COREF> Prime Minister Ehud Barak</COREF> failed *-1 to form a government of national unity .
As night fell <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Monday</COREF> , in the town of Hebron , one Palestinian man was shot *-1 *PRO*-2 dead in an exchange of fire between Palestinian militiamen and Israeli soldiers .
There were also gun battles near Jerusalem .
About 130 people have been killed *-1 in more than three weeks of violence , almost all Palestinians .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Monday</COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Barak</COREF> met with <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="36" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Israel 's</COREF> right wing <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Likud Party</COREF> leader</COREF> <COREF ID="36" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ariel Sharon</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-1 to form an emergency unity government 0 *T*-2 to deal with the crisis , but <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Likud</COREF> says 0 the two failed *-3 to agree on terms .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="VOA20001023.2100.1838.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Middle East</COREF> expert Mark Gulpan , of Tufts University</COREF> , says 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Israel 's</COREF> fragile coalition politics may stand in the way .
Well , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have made deals with <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Likud</COREF> before and <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Likud</COREF> is not completely <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">just Sharon</COREF> , there are moderates within <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Likud</COREF> .
So , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are capable of *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">making</COREF> deals with <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's not really <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the problem</COREF> .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">The problem</COREF> is that the coalition may prevent any possibility of *PRO* creating a real agreement .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Palestinians</COREF> have said 0 <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will not work with <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Sharon</COREF> , and here in US , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> administration spokesman Jake Sewart says 0 <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> is still hard at work *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to find a solution for the <COREF ID="VOA20001023.2100.1838.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Middle East</COREF> crisis .
