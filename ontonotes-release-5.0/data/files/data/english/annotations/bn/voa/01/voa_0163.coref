<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">President Vladimir Putin</COREF> began <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">an official visit to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> *ICH*-1</COREF> Wednesday , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the first by a Russian leader since the collapse of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviet Union</COREF> almost a decade ago</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">VOA 's</COREF> Sonia Paes</COREF> reports that unlike Soviet leaders , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Putin</COREF> intends *PRO*-1 to concentrate on business , not politics .
In the old days of the Cold War when Soviet leaders <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">met</COREF> with <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba 's</COREF> Fidel Castro</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was usually a time for bear hugs and long and often fiery ideological speeches .
Times have changed .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Russian President Vladimir Putin</COREF> has made it *EXP*-1 clear 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> brings no ideological baggage with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> this week .
According to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">political analyst Andre Reabov of the Carnegie Endowment in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Moscow</COREF></COREF> , *PRO* strengthening <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Russia 's</COREF> business and economic ties with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> are a priority for <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Putin</COREF> .
*PRO* Seems to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> that one of the goals of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">this visit</COREF> is *PRO* to help *RNR*-1 , maybe to advance *RNR*-1 the interest of Russian companies in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">this island</COREF> and maybe to restore <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the economical relationship between <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian Federation</COREF> and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF></COREF> .
During Soviet times , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Moscow</COREF> poured in cash 0 *T*-1 to subsidize the Cuban economy .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">The Soviet Union</COREF> provided <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> with oil , petroleum products , foodstuffs and heavy machinery .
In return <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Moscow</COREF> took Cuban sugar , citrus fruits , nickel and cobalt .
Today <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">bilateral trade</COREF> is a fraction of what <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> once was *T*-1 and stands at under one billion dollars a year .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">President Putin</COREF> has said 0 it *EXP*-1 was a mistake *T* to let <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">that relationship</COREF> wither and to allow foreign competitors to take the place that Russian enterprises once held *T*-3 .
The debt issue is certain *PRO* to come up during talks in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Havana</COREF> .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Moscow</COREF> would like *PRO*-1 to see <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> repay some of the billions of dollars 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> still owes *T*-2 from loans that *T*-3 date back to the Soviet era .
No breakthrough agreements are expected *-1 but discussions are likely *-2 to also focus on *PRO* finishing or reactivating a number of projects begun * during Soviet times .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The Russian leader</COREF> meets with <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">President Castro</COREF> <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">Thursday</COREF> morning and is also *-1 to hold talks with National Assembly President Ricardo Alarkon .
The issue of Cuban - American affairs is another likely topic of discussion .
On Tuesday <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">President Putin</COREF> called for an end to the American trade embargo against <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Political analyst Riyardov</COREF> thinks 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Putin</COREF> would like *PRO*-1 to encourage some sort of a between <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Havana</COREF> and <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF></COREF> , much as <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has tried *PRO*-2 to do earlier this year with <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> and <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">North Korea</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Putin</COREF> tried *PRO*-1 to play the role of mediator between <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the Kinshumir regime of the Northern Korea</COREF> and <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">the US administration</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* Seems to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would delight *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to use the same line in the relationship between <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the Castro 's</COREF> regime</COREF> and <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">the US administration</COREF></COREF> too .
Such an attempt would be in line with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Putin 's</COREF> overall foreign policy agenda .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">enhance</COREF> <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Russia 's</COREF> standing in the world and *PRO* to do <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> believes that <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Moscow</COREF> must assume a greater role in international affairs .
After talks in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Havana</COREF> on <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">Thursday</COREF> , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Putin</COREF> and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife are scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to head to one of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba 's</COREF> premier beach resorts for two days of rest before *PRO*-3 traveling on to Canada .
