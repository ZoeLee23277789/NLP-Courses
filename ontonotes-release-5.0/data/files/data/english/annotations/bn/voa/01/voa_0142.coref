<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="VOA20001205.2000.2777.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Ebola</COREF> virus</COREF> is one of the most feared in the world .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The deadly disease</COREF> periodically attacks African villages and kills up to 90 % of those infected * .
Now , a team of researchers led * by scientists at <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda , Maryland</COREF> has developed <COREF ID="VOA20001205.2000.2777.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">a vaccine that *T*-1 prevents <COREF ID="VOA20001205.2000.2777.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Ebola</COREF> virus infections in monkeys</COREF> .
Dr. Garry Nabal of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">NIH</COREF> says , 0 the experiment with <COREF ID="VOA20001205.2000.2777.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the new vaccine</COREF> involved *PRO* giving <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">four monkeys</COREF> the <COREF ID="VOA20001205.2000.2777.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Ebola</COREF> virus , then injecting <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> with <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">a placebo immunization , which *T*-1 has no effect</COREF> .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Four other monkeys</COREF> were infected *-1 with <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="VOA20001205.2000.2777.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Ebola</COREF> virus DNA</COREF> and then were injected *-1 with <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">a vaccine called * *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="VOA20001205.2000.2777.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Ebola</COREF> - Adnia virus booster</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the animals that *T*-1 received <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the control vaccine , i.e. the same vectors , but *PRO* not expressing <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the virus proteins</COREF></COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">all of the animals</COREF> had died within six days after challenge .
In contrast , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the animals who *T*-1 received <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the DNA</COREF> plus <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the Adnia viral vector that *T*-2 made <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the viral proteins</COREF></COREF></COREF> , not only survived the challenge , but <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> continued *-3 to be symptom - free for over six months , the time point that <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were followed *-4 *T*-5 .
Scientists must do far more research on <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">this vaccine</COREF> before a version of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> might be used *-1 *PRO* to prevent the disease in humans .
