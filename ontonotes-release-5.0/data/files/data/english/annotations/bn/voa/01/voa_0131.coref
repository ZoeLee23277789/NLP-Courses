*PRO* Welcome to this hour of VOA News Now .
I 'm Erin Brumett in Washington .
The incredibly close <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> vote count for President is in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the state courts</COREF> and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">heading</COREF> for <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the US Supreme Court</COREF> at the end of the week .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's virtually unprecedented , as <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the federal courts</COREF> have tended *-1 to stay out of elections , which *T*-2 are the responsibility of the states .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Joe O'Grossman</COREF> is a professor of constitutional law at <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Baltimore 's Johns Hopkins University</COREF> .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says that in this instance <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> probably felt 0 the circumstances were such that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had no real alternative but *PRO*-1 to take <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> .
Well , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> took <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> because it seemed like it was such a important issue that it *EXP*-1 would be kind of unseemly for <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to try *PRO*-2 to reject <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out of hand .
In fact , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lawrence Tribe</COREF> , <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Harvard Law School professor who *T*-1 is arguing for <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> tomorrow</COREF> , is going *-2 to ask <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> *PRO*-3 to hold <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> , moot and dismiss <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> campaign</COREF> has brought <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> , but recognizes that the particular issues that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> brought *T*-1 to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> are really not very relevant anymore .
They are going *-1 to probably , well , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know what <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are going *-3 to do *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are going *-1 to try *PRO*-2 to broaden <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> *PRO*-3 to make <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> a kind of a general referendum on election procedures .
So , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are looking for a coronation , and <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> people</COREF> at this point just want *PRO*-1 to get rid *-2 of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> , because <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have a better chance in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> courts</COREF> .
Republicans generally support states ' rights .
So , does it *EXP*-1 appear *-2 somewhat ironic that they are going to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> in this instance ?
No , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think first of all 0 <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the notion that Republicans favor <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">states ' rights</COREF> and Democrats oppose <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> , is much too simplistic .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's generally true , but <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's only true on some issues , and in this case , you could argue that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> people</COREF> are going to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> *PRO*-2 to preserve <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">the right *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> , *PRO* to determine <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own electors</COREF> .
So , there is a kind of states ' rights issue there , but <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need *RNR*-1 , or at least <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> once thought 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> needed *RNR*-1 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> to endorse <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
So it goes both ways .
What are <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the justices</COREF> likely looking for *T*-1 ?
Well , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know .
But I think that - and <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will be divided , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will be unanimous .
Obviously , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would like *PRO*-1 to be able *PRO*-2 to achieve some kind of resolution of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> .
American election laws are often challenged *-1 at the local level and sometimes in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the federal courts</COREF> , but this is certainly the first time 0 we have had a <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> challenge over presidential election *T*-2 .
So , there is a lot of new law here 0 *T*-1 to be made *-2 or at least law that *T*-3 has n't been made *-4 yet .
It *EXP*-1 's possible that if <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> accepts <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the invitation of <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> campaign</COREF> , at least as <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is expressed *-2 in the briefs 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> submitted *T*-3 yesterday</COREF> , that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> will in the sense , take the entire issue , even - not just the specific questions that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was asked *T*-5 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> and try *PRO*-6 to resolve the question .
For example , if <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">says</COREF> 0 it *EXP*-2 is clearly the fact that <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">the legislature of <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the state of Florida</COREF></COREF> can <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">determine</COREF> for <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> who <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> electors will be *T*-1 , <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> will pretty much end <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> , because <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">the legislature</COREF> already plans *PRO*-4 to do *T*-3 , and that does n't mean 0 <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> people</COREF> wo n't keep *-6 trying , because ultimately <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> has *-5 to decide *RNR*-7 and <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">only Congress</COREF> can decide *RNR*-7 if there are competing slates of electors submitted * , which slate *PRO* to accept *T*-8 .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="208" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Johns Hopkins University</COREF> constitutional law professor</COREF> <COREF ID="208" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Joe O'Grossman</COREF></COREF> says , 0 it *EXP*-1 's still not certain 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> will actually hear <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> case</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> first order , of business Friday , <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">attorneys for <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Vice President Gore</COREF></COREF> will move *PRO* to have <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> dismiss <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the case brought * by <COREF ID="VOA20001129.2000.0364.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Republican George W Bush</COREF></COREF> .
