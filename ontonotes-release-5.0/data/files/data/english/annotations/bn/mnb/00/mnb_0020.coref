There was , of course , *NOT* a team of attorneys on both sides of this live network coverage over the weekend of this trial going on in the courtroom in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> , and , of course , among <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the teams of lawyers on the Bush side</COREF> , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the leaders</COREF> , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ben Ginsberg</COREF> , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the lawyers who *T*-2 argued <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> in Leon County Circuit Court</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's with <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> , *PRO*-1 victorious in Tallahassee , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> , and <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Ben</COREF> , whatever the outcome *T*-2 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> , and <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were on the upside , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are forced *-3 now *PRO*-4 to go along with <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the appeals process</COREF> as is *T*-5 the right of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> team</COREF> .
What is <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> reaction to the work 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> will cause *T*-2 *T*-1 ?
Well , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're certainly prepared *PRO*-1 to -- to brief all the issues .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the -- the circuit court judge</COREF> , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Judge Sauls</COREF></COREF> gave a very well reasoned and thorough , both legal and factual discussion of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> law .
Well , *PRO* let <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> talk about <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> statement *ICH*-1 earlier today that -- that <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the Vice President --</COREF> <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were asked *-2 should <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the Vice President</COREF> <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">concede</COREF> , and <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> answered , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the Vice President</COREF> should do what *T*-3 's best for the United States .
Is <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> what <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're trying *PRO*-1 to say *T*-2 ?
Well , sure .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">all the people involved * in this unique -- this unique situation , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the first time 0 a presidential election in our history has been contested *-2 *T*-1</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> , need *-3 to do the right thing , and <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm sure 0 *PRO* do the right thing , as <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> see *PRO* fit .
Do <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the judge there</COREF> , in addition to *PRO*-1 just giving out <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> ruling</COREF> at the end of the court session <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went on beyond the basic issues and added reason upon reason for why <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> turned down the <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> case *T*-2 .
Do <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> method there was *PRO* to try *PRO*-1 to make <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> more or less appeal proof ?
Well , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 what <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did *T*-1 was *PRO* addressed <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the situation as <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> exists in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF></COREF> and addressed the contingencies that *T*-2 were raised *-3 in the voluminous briefs that <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had *T*-4 , not only from the two party candidates involved * , but also of the interveners who *T*-5 were in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know *?* , the Democratic line throughout is 0 they wo n't be happy until every vote is counted *-1 , and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> could n't help *PRO*-2 but notice , should <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> call it *PRO*-3 *?* a rhetorical device 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> used *T*-4 when *PRO* talking to reporters this afternoon *T*-5 .
*PRO* Pause and listen along with <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> to the following piece of videotape .
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Those ballots</COREF> have been counted *-1 not once on <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">election night</COREF> but twice in the recount and how many did you -- did <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> say 0 there were *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">10,750 --</COREF>
If you <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">know</COREF> <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the exact number</COREF> , does n't <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> mean 0 <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've been counted *-1 ?
So <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't suppose 0 that was any accident on <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> part ?
Well , they have been making <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">this point *ICH*-1</COREF> throughout <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">these proceedings</COREF> that <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">these ballots</COREF> have never been counted *-2 , and <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is factually not true .
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have been counted *-1 on <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">election night</COREF> -- <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've been counted *-2 in the recounts , and it *EXP*-4 simply happens *-3 to be not -- not the case that <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">those ballots</COREF> have failed *-5 to be counted *-6 by anyone .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Ben</COREF> , for better or worse , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are forced *-1 now *PRO*-2 to follow <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> team</COREF> as <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> take <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> on a kind of trail of appeal here .
If <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were asked *-1 *PRO*-2 to predict whether <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> stops at the <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> or U.S. Supreme Court , what would <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> prediction be *T*-3 ?
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it 's one of those situations where <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would have predicted all *T*-1 , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that the decisions are not <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">ours</COREF> 0 *PRO* to make *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll be involved in <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">all the legal processes</COREF> obviously as long as <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> campaign</COREF> keeps <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> up , no matter how long that takes *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="223" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ben Ginsberg</COREF> , <COREF ID="223" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">attorney for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the Bush team , victorious <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> in Tallahassee</COREF></COREF> .</COREF>
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> very much , after <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">a long day</COREF> , for *PRO* being with <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> .
Thanks , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> .
