*PRO* Let 's check in with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the court where it 's the law enforcement watch *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Dan Abrams outside <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the building</COREF> .</COREF>
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> , if <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> had *-1 to make a case that it could be <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> , what are the signs *T*-2 ?
Well , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 the number one most important sign is looking at what *T*-1 happened last night , and that is 0 last night at about 7:00 , the public information officer of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> came to <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> and said 0 <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going home .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">told</COREF> *-1 , in effect , 0 there wo n't be a ruling <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> has n't happened <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> .
Now , you know 0 the time is ticking away and yet <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are still here .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Everyone</COREF> still here .
All 0 <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> know *T*-1 is that <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">justices Breyer and Souter</COREF> have been <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">seen</COREF> *-2 driving away , but <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> does n't necessarily tell <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> anything .
There are all sorts of possible explanations for <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
It could be that <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not actually involved in *PRO* finishing up *PRO*-1 writing one of the opinions .
*PRO* Remember , very often , the justices are joint in another justice 's opinion .
It also could be that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the opinion</COREF> is already finished *-1 , and , of course , there 's always the possibility that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not finished *-2 , but <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 the fact that the public information office and many security officers here at <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> are still here tells <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> that the court is in all likelihood still working on this case .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Dan Abrams , outside <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the court , still active court</COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> .</COREF>
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> for that .
