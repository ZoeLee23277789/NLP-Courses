Most Americans do n't yet have a really good picture of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Laura Bush</COREF> .
*PRO* To discuss <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the new first lady</COREF> , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are rejoined *-1 by <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> panel</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> , why do n't <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> take a whack at this *T*-1 .
Have <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ever met <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> ?
No , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have n't *?* .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it is clear *ICH*-1 , though , from *PRO* watching <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> throughout the past year and a half 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is more of the traditional mold of predecessors of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary Clinton</COREF> than like <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary Clinton</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> is not going *-1 to try *PRO*-2 to break the mold like <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Clinton</COREF> did by *PRO* <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">taking</COREF> an active role in policy making .
A lot of Americans were uncomfortable with <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> and <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 *PRO* ended up *-1 being a mistake .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Joyce</COREF> , it looks like <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to say something .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> quibble with the idea 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is of another generation .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Not every wife</COREF> necessarily wants *PRO*-1 to be in politics just because <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband is in politics .
That does n't make <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> a throwback .
I think , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe 0 it *EXP*-1 is probably true , and <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary</COREF> also learned in time that it *ICH*-3 is n't a good idea for the first lady to become too identified with specific policy initiates , at least publicly .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">she <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF></COREF> pulled back on that .
Well , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Deborah</COREF> , *PRO* let's <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> pay proper respect .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> is a teacher and cares about <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">something tremendously important to <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">literacy</COREF></COREF> .
Exactly .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> has worked hard on <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> will tackle <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> the same way 0 <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Barbara Bush</COREF> did *?* *T*-1 , *PRO* encouraging reading .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm sure 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> will have programs and initiatives .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary Clinton</COREF> did a lot of things too .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> is out with another book , *PRO* Entertaining at the White House and Redecorating the White House .
*PRO* Doing what we think of *T*-1 as more traditional first lady things can be very , very effective .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Deborah</COREF> , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> remember that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Clinton</COREF> chafed at <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the idea of *PRO* being in the traditional role</COREF> .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> was not at all happy about <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
In the first campaign <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> talked about *PRO* <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">having</COREF> *-1 to bake cookies .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> n't pleased with <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
<COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is right .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Joyce</COREF> makes a good point , too .
After health care reform failed , <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> changed <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> steages a bit .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> pulled back .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> began *-1 doing more traditional things in public , whereas in private <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did still work on the causes 0 <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> cared about *T*-2 , <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> advocated and lobbied in a quiet , behind the scenes way .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> did n't make a big deal out of *PRO* being a co-president anymore .
That is exactly my point , Joe .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Clinton</COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">deal</COREF> with policy .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> loves <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> and is steeped *-1 in <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Clearly <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Bush</COREF> does n't want *PRO*-1 to go down that road .
It depends .
<COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">Literacy</COREF> is a big problem in <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF> .
Nothing that <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Barbara Bush</COREF> did or said *T*-1 , with due respect , addressed <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in an important way .
It was more of a show .
What *T*-1 needs *-2 to be done *-3 about literacy is *PRO* to spend a lot of money , which President - elect Bush proposed *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> was <COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a large spending program</COREF> , <COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a $ 5 billion *U* literacy program</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Laura Bush</COREF> could be a big help with <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , not like <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Hillary Clinton with health care</COREF> , but a symbol with teachers , librarians , people who *T*-1 care about reading and believe 0 every American should be able *PRO*-2 to read and put clout behind <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
In that way <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could be a great asset .
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is a policy that *T*-1 is very hard 0 *PRO* to disagree with *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> could be the symbol of *PRO* really doing something .
*PRO* Let us hope so .
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> for *PRO* talking to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
