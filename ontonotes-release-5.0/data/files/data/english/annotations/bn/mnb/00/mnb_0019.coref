<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Gregg Jarrett</COREF> , they did get <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">a unanimous court for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this decision</COREF></COREF> .
Absolutely , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a very stern , very direct and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> left no question *ICH*-1 , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think , in the minds of anybody that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">this court</COREF> unanimously believes that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">certification</COREF> should <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">include</COREF> <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the manual recount</COREF> , and <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is a clear victory for <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Vice President Al Gore</COREF> .
The language here , really leaves no doubt .
The right *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> *PRO* to cast <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> vote , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> said 0 *?* , is paramount .
<COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">The amended certifications</COREF> must be accepted *-1 by <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">November 26</COREF> .
The reason 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are picking <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">that particular day</COREF> *T*-1 is 0 it allows , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> , enough time for <COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the aggrieved party</COREF> , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the losing party</COREF> to file within 10 days <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">a contest of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the certification</COREF></COREF> and that still allows enough time for <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the contest</COREF> to be litigated *-2 through the courts <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">primarily the circuit court</COREF> and back to the Supreme Court if necessary and still meet the December 12 deadline for the Electoral College vote here .
Now , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Greg</COREF> , the only question that *T*-1 mean means anything at this hour .
We know 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> view is 0 <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the hand counts</COREF> should now <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> included *-2 .
Will <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> put <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF> over the top in the race *PRO* to match and exceed the votes of George W. Bush ?
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> very well could *?* , although , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> must say that <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> campaign</COREF> has been somewhat disappointed by the number of votes 0 <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have not received *T*-1 thus far in the counties that *T*-2 are undertaking <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the manual recounts</COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> , but a lot of hand counts still must be tallied *-3 .
We are also including <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the undervotes of 10,000 in Palm Beach and junt votes of 10,000 in Miami - Dade</COREF> as well .
*PRO* Keep in mind , 0 <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> were not registered *-1 by the computers because <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> either had a hanging chad or dimpled chad .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Those</COREF> must be gone over *-1 by hand by each respective canvassing board .
So there are a lot of votes remaining there .
This is a <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> campaign to the White House .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Greg</COREF> , just a logistic question , How long is it *EXP*-3 going *-1 take <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *T*-2 *PRO* to get <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the opinion</COREF> run to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> from the building behind <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say 0 <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> should have <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> here in the next five minutes .
It depends how quickly the line moves *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">two producers , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe 0 *?* , near the front of the line</COREF> .
It how quickly <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get handed *T*-1 .
It reversed the two orders of the earlier trial court , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Circuit Court</COREF> Judge Terry Lewis .
The bottom line , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">this court</COREF> rules unanimously 0 the right *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> *PRO* to have the votes counted *-2 is paramount , thus , <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the amended certifications *PRO* to include <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the hand counts</COREF></COREF> must be accepted *-3 by <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">November 26</COREF> .
In fact , it seemed *-1 to have <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">some language here</COREF> .
In fact , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do have <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> handed *-1 to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> now .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> take a the .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> , if for some reason the Secretary of State would n't accept by <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the 26th</COREF> , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the certification</COREF> , it could be certified *-1 elsewhere .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Gregg Jarrett .</COREF>
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> should point out , 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is a former lawyer <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> and so can help *PRO* put <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> into English .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Greg</COREF> , *PRO* go ahead , if <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> come to a passage 0 <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> should hear *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm flipping through <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">the summary of enacts</COREF> because <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is not important .
<COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">The summary of facts .</COREF>
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> flag <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> when <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> come to the first portion 0 <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> should hear *T*-1 aloud *T*-2 .
