And <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> continue <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> *-1 to try *PRO*-2 to measure just how <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this story</COREF> is playing overseas *T*-3 as <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll be doing each night all week .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Tonight</COREF> , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the anchor of <COREF ID="MNB20001113.2100.2801.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Israeli network evening newscast on <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Channel 2 Jerusalem</COREF></COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jacob Elon</COREF></COREF> on what <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Israelis</COREF> are thinking and saying *T*-1 about <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">America 's</COREF> long wait for a President - elect .
Frankly , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are shocked here .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are used to <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the Israeli political system , always tied * and always tied * up</COREF> , and election nights here too close 0 *PRO* to call *T*-1 more often than not , but what you 're experiencing *T*-2 over there is really inconceivable to <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Israelis</COREF> .
They spend a lot of air time here *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to convey <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the electoral system</COREF> to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> viewers here , and the election action 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> got *T*-3 was basically Hey , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is undemocratic .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is the greatest democracy 0 we 're talking about *T*-1 , and <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the system</COREF> is undemocratic , and the turnout as well <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> felt 's over 90 % here usually , and it *EXP*-2 's hard for Israeli citizens to grasp 50 % .
Since we 're talking about Israeli reel and the Middle East , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not , you know , the major headline <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">every day</COREF> , but <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> certainly was a major story .
On the election day , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had hours and hours of broadcast here live , same as in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the States</COREF> , and <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've been following <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this story</COREF> , of course , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">every day</COREF> , but here as usual , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> might say *T*-1 , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have news of <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> own .
Actually today , we just had four Israelis killed *-1 in three separate terrorist acts .
The peace forces do n't like uncertainty , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say 0 *?* even less than the stock market , and things here are getting worse day by day .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> is usually looking up to <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the President of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF></COREF> for some help .
Some Israelis at least , if not most of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , are still hoping that <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF> might be able *PRO*-1 to intervene and help in the short time 0 <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has left *T*-2 , but the more things are complicated and uncertain back there in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the States</COREF> , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 more and more Israelis are worried that there 's nobody 0 *PRO* to turn toment -- to *T*-3 , and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 what *T*-4 happened in the past few days among Israelis here is a new perception that maybe <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">things in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF></COREF> are not as perfect as they might have thought .
Actually , <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're far from *PRO* being perfect , and <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are sounding and looking to <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">us here</COREF> more and more like what <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> know *T*-1 from <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> own political system</COREF> .
That insight <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> from <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jacob Eilon</COREF> , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the anchorman <COREF ID="MNB20001113.2100.2801.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Israel 's</COREF> <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Channel 2</COREF> network news</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> took time out from *PRO*-1 covering the death of <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="137" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lea Rabin</COREF> , <COREF ID="137" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">widow of Yitzhak Rabin</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> died yesterday of cancer at the age of 72 .
