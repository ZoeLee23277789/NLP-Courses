And good evening to you .
There is still no clear winner in the election that *T*-1 was now two nights ago .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">A recount</COREF> under way in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> , and it may not end there .
Here is *T*-1 the status of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the recount</COREF> as of this hour .
The two candidates <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">separated</COREF> * by only 225 votes , with <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">65 out of 67 counties</COREF> reporting .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has narrowed dramatically <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">all day</COREF> long .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> campaign</COREF> seemed *-1 to say 0 the case belongs in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> state courts .
The <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> campaign chided right back that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the other side</COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to keep voting until <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> like the and increasingly across <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> you can hear <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and feel <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">The split</COREF> now palpable .
There 's and among partisan , anger .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Americans</COREF> remain glued to <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> television sets , but no answer is coming out and even Cuba remarked <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> in an official statement that it *EXP*-1 sure is taking <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> a long time *PRO*-2 to pake pick a .
Odd pairings <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> at <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> when all <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the nation 's</COREF> living presidents except Reagan were together at <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> *PRO*-1 celebrating the 200th anniversary of <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the grand house</COREF> *T*-2 .
There was <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">George W. Bush 's</COREF> dad alongside the President <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> for a photo op .
We have correspondents <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> .
First to <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> capital</COREF> and <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">legal correspondent Dan Abrams in <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Tallahassee</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was supposed *-1 to be the day when <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were going *-2 to have a final decision , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were going *-4 to know what *T*-5 is the result of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the recount in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF></COREF> *T*-3 .
*PRO* Not to be the case .
The official results showing 0 <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">only 53 of the 67 counties</COREF> have issued <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> recount results</COREF> and provided <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the state government here</COREF> .
On the other hand , as <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> reported *?* just a moment ago , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the Associated Press</COREF> reporting that <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">65 of the 67 counties</COREF> have reported .
The problem is 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the numbers</COREF> are so very different .
On the one hand you have <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the Associated Press</COREF> saying <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">225 - vote difference after <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">65 counties</COREF></COREF> .
You have the officials here saying after <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">53 counties</COREF> , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">exactly the same number difference that it was *T*-1 when <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the recount</COREF> began *T*-2</COREF> , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">1,784</COREF> , and if you watch the way 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">these numbers</COREF> have been coming in *T*-3 , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Associated Press</COREF> numbers</COREF> have constantly made <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> closer and closer , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> gaining ground on <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> with almost every county 's result .
On the other hand , <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the official numbers that *T*-1 have been coming in</COREF> keep seesawing .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> gets a few more , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> gets a few more and we 're gack back to even again , according to state officials .
So when we get the two remaining counties *T*-1 will that be <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the best number going</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know if to be <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the best number</COREF> .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just ca n't believe 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">these numbers</COREF> are going *-1 to end up *-2 matching at the end .
MSNBC
Because as <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">A.P.</COREF> has continued with <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> numbers</COREF> the progression has been consistent .
Every time 0 <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> gave you a set of count ids counties that *T*-1 have been vaulted evaluated *-2 *T*-3 , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> was getting closer and closer .
On the other hand , with every group of counties reporting officially it remained about even .
So in the end , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">Brian</COREF> , <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 official <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the official numbers</COREF> will be the numbers that *T*-1 apply but we 'll have *-2 to wait and see when all 67 are counted *-4 by both *T*-3 .
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> for that .
And there are still several thousand absentee votes .
