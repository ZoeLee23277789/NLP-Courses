<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Correa</ENAMEX> is the new President of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> .
This has become almost certain , even before the release of the official results of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> round of presidential elections which this country , located on the western side of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">South America</ENAMEX> , has witnessed .
The difference in the announced numbers between what the leftist candidate , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correa</ENAMEX> , and his competitor , billionaire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvaro Noboa</ENAMEX> , have achieved is so great , it is hard for any expected change to occur in the early announcement of the results , according to voter surveys .
Observers do not expect the predictions of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noboa</ENAMEX> , who fought his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> presidential battle armed with money , to come true : that a civil war would erupt if his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">forty - three - year - old</ENAMEX> rival , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correa</ENAMEX> , won .
This choice of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Ecuadorian</ENAMEX> voters reflects great hopes on one hand for political stability for the country , for which <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> Presidents of the Republic have alternated since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 1996</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> of them were forced to resign under the pressure of public demonstrations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Secondly</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> , with its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thirteen - and - a - half million</ENAMEX> residents , is left with the paradox that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three quarters</ENAMEX> of those live in a state of poverty , though it is an oil producing country .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Thirdly</ENAMEX> , in getting out of the orbit of the political influence of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , which owns a military base in it , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correa</ENAMEX> has promised to remove it unless <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington</ENAMEX> accepts <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> having a military base on its land .
