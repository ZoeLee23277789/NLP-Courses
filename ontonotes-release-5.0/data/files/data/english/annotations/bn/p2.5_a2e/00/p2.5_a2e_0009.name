The young man , who leads the armed wing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Tawhid Wal Jihad Organization</ENAMEX> , tried to escape but the security forces surrounded him , and he had no alternative , either to surrender or to commit suicide , so he chose the latter by detonating an explosive belt he had tied around his waist .
