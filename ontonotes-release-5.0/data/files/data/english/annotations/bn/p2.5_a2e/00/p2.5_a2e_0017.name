From <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> ,
Pope <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benedict XVI</ENAMEX> began his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> visit to the lands of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ankara</ENAMEX> .
The Supreme Pontiff received <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> welcomes , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> official that was not lacking in hospitality , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> was popular and it was an angry one .
The Pope met with the supreme religious authority in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Turkey</ENAMEX> and called for a dialogue of civilizations .
In spite of his attempts at distancing his visit from any political character , he nevertheless declared his support for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> 's accession to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> .
A noticeable change in his position did not alter the resentment of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkish</ENAMEX> street on account of his previous statements on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Ankara Airport</ENAMEX> is the first <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> soil on which Pope <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benedict XVI</ENAMEX> sets foot since his ascension to the papal throne .
In his reception , he found the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Turkish</ENAMEX> Prime Minister , who postponed his trip to attend the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> summit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Latvia</ENAMEX> so that the Pope would not seem as officially unwelcome as he is popularly unwelcome .
But the diplomacy of welcomes does not hide the embarrassment of both sides at a visit laden with veiled political symbolism , including the symbol communicated by the Pope 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> activity .
The visit to the mausoleum of the founder of modern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kemal Ataturk</ENAMEX> , was a stance on the proposition of secularism , and words with religious significance written by the Pope in the mausoleum 's golden visitors ' book and a stamp that the Pope insisted on displaying in the plane that carried him to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> .
This is not a political visit ; it is a religious visit aiming at finding common ground for peace and deepening the dialogue .
A dialogue between the various cultures and between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> religions of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Christianity</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> .
But politics has followed the Pope as it has preceded him .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erdogan</ENAMEX> tried to ease the atmosphere by saying that the Pope 's position on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> 's accession to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> was contrary to his position when he was called Cardinal Ratzinger .
The Pope said in reply to my question on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Turkey</ENAMEX> 's joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> that he is not a politician but he supports this accession .
But the change in positions did not change anything in the universal anger that is sweeping through the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Turkish</ENAMEX> street .
Thousands of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Turks</ENAMEX> came out under the vigilant eyes of the security forces to reject the Pope 's visit and to protest his failure to retract his statements about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Islam</ENAMEX> .
