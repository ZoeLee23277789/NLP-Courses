The surprise victory of the leftist candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Correa</ENAMEX> in the run - off presidential elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> recalled the rise of the leftist tide in many countries in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Latin American</ENAMEX> states region .
The victory of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correa</ENAMEX> , who is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">eighth</ENAMEX> president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</ENAMEX> , will strengthen the campaign of his ally , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Venezuelan</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugo Chavez</ENAMEX> , who aims at establishing an alliance of the leftist governments facing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> influence in the region .
The initial results that have been announced confirmed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Correa</ENAMEX> received <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">sixty - eight percent</ENAMEX> of the total votes versus <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">thirty - one percent</ENAMEX> for his competitor , the rightist candidate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvaro Noboa</ENAMEX> , who had won the majority of votes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> round of the elections .
While supporters of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Correa</ENAMEX> started to celebrate the victory in different areas of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alvaro Noboa</ENAMEX> , the richest man in the country , who is seeking to win the presidency position for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> time , questioned the accuracy of these results .
The winning candidate , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafael Correa</ENAMEX> , who preceded the announcement of the final results , renewed his intention to call for forming a constitutional association that enjoys full authority , and opposed the currently stalled negotiations for reaching a free trade agreement with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
The winning president in these elections faces a difficult challenge to his ability to govern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ecuador</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next four years</ENAMEX> , as it is a politically unstable country that has overthrown many presidents : the last of them was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lucio Gutierrez</ENAMEX> , who dissolved <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Court</ENAMEX> and appointed new judges who cancelled an arrest warrant against a former president accused of corruption .
