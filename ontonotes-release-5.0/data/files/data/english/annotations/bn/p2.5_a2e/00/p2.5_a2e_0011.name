He prolonged his visit by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> day and broadened the scope of his meetings .
He also stayed his course by repeating the refrain of hope that he and his mission will achieve some success .
He insisted on pointing to the full <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> , and not the empty <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> , of the glass .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Arab League</ENAMEX> Secretary General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amr Moussa</ENAMEX> , who is apprehensive of the devil in the details , carried what he had in his bag and tirelessly made the rounds of those involved in the current crisis .
After his meeting with Lt. General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michel Aoun</ENAMEX> , he reiterated that it is the responsibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> before anyone else to search for the desired solution .
I think that here , even though there may be regional or international influences or other considerations , the solution must be <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> .
The responsibility is that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> leaders , indeed of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> people , not to allow the collapse of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and the harm that is occurring to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussa</ENAMEX> , who revealed that he had , away from the limelight , a positive meeting with the Secretary General of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah</ENAMEX> , also paid a visit to the leader of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> Forces Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samir Geagea</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Maronite</ENAMEX> Patriarch Cardinal <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nasrallah Boutros Sfeir</ENAMEX> , after he had met earlier with Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fouad Siniora</ENAMEX> and the leader of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Future Movement</ENAMEX> , MP <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saad Hariri</ENAMEX> .
He confirmed that he was able to discuss details , and who knows what the details are !
This time , we got into the details , and the devil is in the details .
And then , there are difficulties that are becoming clearer and difficulties that are beginning to be solved .
And this requires us uh , to work , uh , to concentrate our work .
MP <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hariri</ENAMEX> praised the efforts of the Secretary General of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Arab League</ENAMEX> and his success in bringing the perspectives of the parties in the current crisis closer .
Whereas Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geagea</ENAMEX> denied on his part that the parliamentary majority group is the one putting obstacles in the way of this initiative .
However , it is striking that the MP and former Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Suleiman Franjieh</ENAMEX> , in parallel with the end of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">22nd</ENAMEX> day of the open sit - in in front of the government <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Serail building</ENAMEX> in downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beirut</ENAMEX> , launched a sharp attack on the other side , accusing it of blocking the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moussa</ENAMEX> initiative .
He revealed that the opposition will announce civil disobedience after the holidays and will close the roads leading to the airport and the harbor in order to achieve the demands put forth .
