No clear features have appeared yet for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jordanian</ENAMEX> initiative seeking a way out of the crisis between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbas</ENAMEX> ' government , amid separation of positions , between the calls of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud Abbas</ENAMEX> for early general elections and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> ' insistence on its refusal and the emphasis on a national unity government , while the realities in the field warn of destroying the fragile cease - fire .
The features of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jordanian</ENAMEX> initiative , which the media have circulated to deal with the internal <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> struggle between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fatah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> movements , have not appeared yet .
Whereas only <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud Abbas</ENAMEX> received an invitation to visit the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jordanian</ENAMEX> capital <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next Sunday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> movement announced its welcome to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jordanian</ENAMEX> role , but it confirmed its position in which it considers the only way out of the crisis is a national unity government on the basis of the national reconciliation accord , and not according to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> measures , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> movement declared its position and will not change this position , that it wo n't accept these elections and this attempt to -- the coup on the will of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> people .
Ah -- the only alternative is the dialogues in order to form the national unity government on the basis of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Palestinian Document of National Reconciliation</ENAMEX> .
Any context outside this framework will lead to agitating the internal situation and reaching a stage that has no ah -- good consequences .
In its turn , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fatah</ENAMEX> movement confirmed its insistence on the necessity to form a technocratic government that is internationally accepted and aims at removing the siege .
The position of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fatah</ENAMEX> and the position of President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud Abbas</ENAMEX> , no return to the fruitless dialogue , -- no return to a dialogue without results , no return to a dialogue in which the element of time is exploited .
We are looking forward to submitting creative ideas .
At the level of the other factions , supporters of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> factions demonstrated , raising the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> flag only , calling for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fatah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> to abide by the truce agreement , to end the security chaos syndrome , and return to the negotiations table in order to activate the talks to form a national unity government .
