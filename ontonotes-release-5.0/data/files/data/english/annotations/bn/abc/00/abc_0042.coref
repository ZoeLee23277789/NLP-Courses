In yesterday 's ruling from Florida 's Supreme Court , the chief justice <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">warned</COREF> 0 *PRO* recounting undervotes in the counties would cause `` confusion and disorder . ''
In some places today <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">those words</COREF> appeared *-1 prophetic .
<COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Mike Von Fremd</COREF> from <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Jacksonville</COREF> .
When <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> issued <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> decision *PRO* to stop</COREF> *T*-1 , observers in the counting room were told *-2 *PRO*-3 to leave .
Are you serious ?
As soon as <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> see <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in writing , if <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> says *PRO* stop , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will stop .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're stopping right now until <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> see if <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need *-1 to keep on *-2 stopping .
The process stopped before a single ballot was counted *-1 .
Tempers flared early on after <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican chairman of the Canvassing Board</COREF> announced in advance that it *EXP*-1 was impossible *PRO* to meet tomorrow 's p.m. deadline .
No possible way .
If <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can not carry out <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> constitutional duty *PRO* to do <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> , then <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> should do as the judge in Tallahassee did *?* , *PRO* recuse <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> , put somebody *ICH*-1 there who *T*-2 can get <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> done *-3 !
cheers and applause
The problem is that the 5,000 undercount ballots are mixed *-1 in with the pool of nearly 300,000 ballots .
They flew in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">a computer consultant 0 *T*-1 to install a program 0 *T*-2 to separate the ballots</COREF> .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> explanation of how it all works *T*-1 baffled <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
We load the cards into the reader hopper at which time the machine looks for a light and then passes into the stacker *T*-1 .
From beginning to end , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">both sides</COREF> fought every step of the way .
This morning <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could not decide how *PRO* to begin *T*-1 .
Tonight , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the two sides</COREF> are arguing about what *PRO* to do *T*-1 now that <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have been <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">told</COREF> *-2 *PRO*-3 to stop .
Democrats say , at least *PRO* sort the ballots .
Republicans said , No way .
