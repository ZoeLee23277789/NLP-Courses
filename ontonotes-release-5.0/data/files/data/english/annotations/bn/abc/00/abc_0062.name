But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to the serious business --
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George W. Bush 's</ENAMEX> nominees for his cabinet are still getting a going - over in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> and President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> is causing a mild stir here by his reluctance to slide out of the spotlight .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> asked for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">seven minutes</ENAMEX> on television <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> to say good-bye and he will get it , from us .
Here <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , down at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the White House</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jock Cochran</ENAMEX> .
He will point out challenges facing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , implied and that is some disapproval for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's tax cut proposals .
He will also say <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> must stay engaged with the world , and the President will talk about the importance of building one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , including racial reconciliation .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> hopes history will look kindly on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> 's speech , but history ignores most presidential farewells .
Exceptions include the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> one , from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Washington</ENAMEX> , and war hero <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dwight Eisenhower</ENAMEX> 's surprising warning about the influence of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Nixon</ENAMEX> made the history books , but only because he said -- I shall resign the presidency effective at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon tomorrow</ENAMEX> .
Even the Great Communicator , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Reagan</ENAMEX> , got only middling marks for his farewell .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is respected again in the world and looked to for leadership .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush the Elder</ENAMEX> left by saying nothing -- no farewell address .
`` It would just be an ego trip , '' he told friends .
Would n't be prudent , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> could not pass up his last chance to use the bully pulpit .
This is someone who wants to create a place for himself in the politics of the future , even if it 's simply campaigning at the side of his wife .
Therefore , what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> is said in large part with an eye to his own political future , but for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> 's speech is a real change , for , as you noted , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter</ENAMEX> , this one will be short -- very short , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">only about seven minutes</ENAMEX> .
Short for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Clinton</ENAMEX> , certainly .
Thanks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Cochran</ENAMEX> .
