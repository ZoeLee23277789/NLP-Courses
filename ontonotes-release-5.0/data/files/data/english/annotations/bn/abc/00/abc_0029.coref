We are going *-1 to take `` a closer look '' at <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the great Wind Cave in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">South Dakota</COREF></COREF> .
No easy matter .
We know 0 caving is a popular pasttime for some Americans , a horrifying thought for others , especially anyone prone to claustrophobia .
We asked <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Judy Muller</COREF> if <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> would like *PRO*-1 to do the story of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">a fascinating man</COREF> .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> took a deep breath and said , okay .
This wild landscape in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">South Dakota</COREF> may evoke images of the frontier West , but the real frontier is far beneath .
Elevation plus 11 .
The real pioneers are men like <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">John Sheltons who *T*-1 explore underground caves</COREF> .
The most fascinating is the maze known * as <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wind Cave</COREF> .
When you find one where no one has been there , you are the first person *T*-1 *T*-2 , the adrenaline is phenomenal .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> first came here as a tourist 30 years ago .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> offered *PRO*-1 to map <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> for the Park Service .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> thought 0 *PRO* would take a week or two .
It 's now 30 years down the road .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm no closer to *PRO*-1 completing the agreement .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The cave</COREF> is seemingly endless .
3 miles of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the cave</COREF> have been surveyed *-1 , every inch logged *-2 by hand , then fed *-1 into a computer which *T*-3 plots every nook and cranny .
We 're only representing about 5 % of the known volume that *T*-1 could possibly be here .
95 % of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the cave</COREF> is unmapped ?
Yes .
The first recorded discovery of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the cave</COREF> was in 1881 .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">A cowboy hunting in the area</COREF> heard <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the sound of rushing wind</COREF> .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> followed <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to this narrow opening .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The wind</COREF> was so strong , or so the story goes , that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> blew <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hat off <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> head .
Since then , many visitors have been drawn *-1 into <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this world of crystals , fossils and calcite formations known * as forecast work and popcorn and rarest of all , fox work</COREF> .
Each new discovery means *PRO* heading down another tight , dark hall .
Your stomach is against the floor and your back is against the wall .
As <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> crawled along , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> found <COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an item left * by earlier explorers</COREF> .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">A 103 - year - old newspaper .</COREF>
The ultimate payoff is when they find <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">a new chamber</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">The knowledge that our lights are the first 0 *T*-1 to light <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up , our footprints were the first , our eyes were first first 0 *T*-2 to see <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .</COREF>
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> calls <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 addictive .
You get withdrawal .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to find more , something bigger or deeper .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> no longer expects *-1 to see the end of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the cave</COREF> in <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> lifetime .
That , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , is just fine with <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
