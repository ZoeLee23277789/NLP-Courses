When <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole ''</COREF> was <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">attacked</COREF> *-1 last October and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">17 sailors</COREF> were killed *-3 *T*-2 , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">one of the sailors on board <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole ''</COREF></COREF> used <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own camera *PRO*-4 to record some of the aftermath .
These are pictures 0 you have not seen *T*-1 before , what the terrorists did *T*-2 to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">a $ 1 billion *U* ship</COREF> , not to mention the country 's morale .
Here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">ABC 's</COREF> John M Wethy</COREF> .
Most of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the sailors who *T*-1 died</COREF> were about *-2 to have lunch .
A half - eaten meal still sits on the table .
A few feet away , destruction is total -- the floor driven *-1 up through the ceiling , a deadly twisting of steel , daylight showing through a gaping hole in the side of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> .
We was lucky *PRO*-1 to make it through all this .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Seaman Carl Wingate , who *T*-1 shot this home video</COREF> , remembers the moment , along with <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> shipmates .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a really loud boom .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean , it *EXP*-1 's almost undescribable how loud <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> actually started *-1 running up the passageway , up the ladder .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> opened up the door , and there was no deck there .
It 's gone .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> felt my whole body shaking .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was getting electrocuted *-1 .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't know what *T*-1 was going on .
In the hours just after <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the blast</COREF> , the crew is in a state of shock .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Some still covered * with soot from <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the explosion</COREF></COREF> wander through darkened passageways , *PRO*-1 still not sure what *T*-2 hit <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
God was -- <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> was with me today .
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">A senior enlisted man</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would have been killed *-1 if <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had not been called *-2 to a meeting moments before <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the blast</COREF> .
There was debris laying all over .
Outside , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the ship 's</COREF> exterior walls are pitted *-1 by shrapnel from <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the explosion</COREF> .
An orange life raft , blown * from the deck , is plastered *-1 to the side of the bridge , like a moth on the front of a speeding car .
Crewmen , now at battle stations , stand at a 50 - caliber machine gun that *T*-1 was unmanned when <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the attack</COREF> occurred *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">The Navy 's</COREF> final report on <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the `` <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Cole</COREF> '' attack</COREF> is expected *-1 to explain why no one will be punished *-2 , even though the captain and crew failed *-3 to take basic steps *T* to protect <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> *T*-4 .
Sources say 0 <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> will accept part of the blame , by *PRO*-1 admitting 0 all <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> ships were vulnerable and <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sailors were not trained *-2 *PRO*-3 to expect this kind of attack .
