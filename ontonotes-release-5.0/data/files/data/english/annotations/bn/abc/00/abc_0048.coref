It will be a long time that it *EXP*-2 's forgotten *-1 that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> won this the way 0 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did *?* *T*-3 in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> .
Yes , it *EXP*-1 took a while last night *PRO* to sort out precisely what <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> had <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">decided</COREF> *T*-2 by such a narrow margin .
It is <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">case number 00949</COREF> , and <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be dissected *-1 for years 0 *PRO*-2 to come .
Here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">ABC 's</COREF> Jackie Judd</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">The Supreme Court</COREF> cleared the way for <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">George W. Bush</COREF> to become President by *PRO*-2 interpreting <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the principle of `` equal protection under the law ''</COREF> in a way 0 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had never done before *T*-1 .
Equal protection cases often deal with discrimination based * on race .
Here , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> applied <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to *PRO* counting voters ' ballots .
It *EXP*-1 's now become clear , that as a matter of federal law , there have *-2 to be reasonably uniform standards for *PRO* collecting <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">people 's votes</COREF> and for *PRO* interpreting <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">those votes</COREF> .
In fact , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">equal protection</COREF> became the single issue 0 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">this divided court</COREF> could find a majority 0 *T*-1 to support *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was a stabilizing decision that *T*-1 restored order to a very chaotic situation .
And with that in mind , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the justices</COREF> -- in a highly unusual move -- said 0 <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ruling</COREF> `` is limited *-1 to the present circumstances '' only , *PRO* meaning 0 <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> applies just to <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> v. Gore</COREF> .
Not likely say , say *?* many legal experts .
What <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've done *T*-1 now amounts to , what *T*-2 could be <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">a very important general principle</COREF> , and take <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> right back again immediately by *PRO* saying , `` well , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't intend *PRO*-3 to enforce <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> in any other case . ''
Even those who *T*-1 support aspects of <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the ruling</COREF> still expect <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to affect many states with election laws similar to Florida .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> raises a host of new questions , not just about recounts , but about different voting machines and differences between one city and another city within the same state .
Even <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> raises questions about differences between citizens of different states .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">This historic decision</COREF> will certainly be remembered *-1 as the one that *T*-2 put <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">a President</COREF> in the White House , but <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> may also become a decision that *T*-3 expands the judiciary 's role in future elections as well .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Jackie Judd</COREF> , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">ABC News</COREF> , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> .
