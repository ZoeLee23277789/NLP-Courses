This week , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> began *-1 opening <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> borders</COREF> , just slightly , so that some Palestinians could go back to work .
Officials say 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the block over the past two months</COREF> has been necessary for security , but for Palestinians in <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Gaza</COREF> and the West Bank , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has been an economic nightmare .
Here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ABC20001216.1830.0708.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">ABC 's</COREF> Gillian Findlay</COREF> .
This is how bad it has gotten *T*-1 for <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Ahmad Al - dour</COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Out of work , *PRO*-1 out of savings , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is now trying *PRO*-1 to sell <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">one of the few valuables 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has left *T*-2</COREF> .
0 The most important thing is *PRO* to buy milk for <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the children</COREF> , says *T*-1 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">this father of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">two</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't care about the price .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just need *-1 to sell <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
These days , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Gaza 's</COREF> central market is filled *-1 with people who *T*-2 need *-3 to sell .
TV's , stereos , even bicycles .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mohammed 's</COREF> parents</COREF> told <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> needed the money for food .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> closed <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> borders</COREF> for security reasons , but the economic impact here has been devastating .
It 's not just that tens of thousands of Palestinians who *T*-1 used *-2 to work in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> are unemployed , construction in <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Gaza</COREF> has all but stopped .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> has blocked cement supplies .
Gas is also in short supply , and from time to time , so is *T*-1 food .
According to the United Nations , in just three months , the number of Palestinians living below the poverty line has risen by 50 % .
One in three Palestinians now live on less than $ 2 *U* a day .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> economy , which *T*-1 had been growing , now loses close to $ 9 million *U* a day .
I really do n't think 0 we have much longer than the end of January before real disaster starts *-1 hitting from the economic point of view .
Five years ago <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Bashar Al - masri</COREF> gave up a successful Washington investment career *PRO*-1 to return to <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Ramallah</COREF> and help *PRO* build <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the new Palestinian state</COREF> .
Business was good , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , until <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">the Palestinians</COREF> started <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> uprising .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> began *-1 shooting back .
The bullet came in here and hit the wall right here .
And all of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Al - masri 's</COREF> investors fled .
Soon , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will have no choice but *PRO* to lay off <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> staff , *PRO* making more people unemployed , more people desperate .
If the Israelis think that <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">things</COREF> are going *-1 to get better , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are going *-2 to get much , much worse because you are going *-3 to have many more people who *T*-4 are hopeless .
Hopeless , and angry .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> wants security .
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Palestinians</COREF> say , 0 *PRO* strangling <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> economically is only going *-1 to make things worse .
