In space another chapter *ICH*-1 unfolding , the final chapter of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">what *T*-2 was once a shining symbol of the future</COREF> , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Russia 's failing space station Mir</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the oft - troubled craft</COREF> was <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">gassed</COREF> *-2 up , *PRO* so to speak *T*-1 , for the last time .
Here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">ABC 's</COREF> Mike Lee</COREF> .
It looked like a slow - motion video game .
It was the nose camera on the unmanned Progress shipped inched closer to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the abandoned Mir Station</COREF> , space history was being made *-1 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">This long suffering , long deteriorating orbiting lab</COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">received</COREF> the extra fuel 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> needs *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to destroy <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> .
The plan is for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mir 's</COREF> thrusters to be fired *-1 up by remote control in late February for re-entry orbit .
Most of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the station</COREF> is expected *-1 to vaporize as <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> comes down , some fragments splashing into the Pacific Ocean .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">The Mir</COREF> was first launched *-1 15 years ago .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was the cutting edge of research into long - term space stations .
Much was learned *-1 about construction , rendezvous and docking , the effect of long - term weightlessness upon plants , microorganisms and humans .
American astronauts even worked there .
As <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mir</COREF> grew old , and with little Russian money 0 *T*-1 to fix or replace <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the station</COREF> became accident - prone -- damage from the fire , gaping holes from a collision with a supply ship , computers broken * due to faulty cables .
Now <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mir</COREF> is being made *-1 irrelevant by a new , multi-nation space station under construction .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Today 's</COREF> final fuel delivery</COREF> marks the last days of one of modern Russia 's biggest triumphs and biggest embarrassments .
