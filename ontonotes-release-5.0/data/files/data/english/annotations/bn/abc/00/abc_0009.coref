<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Tomorrow 's summit meeting</COREF> will bring <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ehud Barak</COREF> and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Yasser Arafat</COREF></COREF> to the resort city of Sharm El - eikh .
*PRO* Getting <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">both</COREF> to attend was not an easy task .
The last thing 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF> did *T*-1 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> before *PRO*-2 heading to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the Mideast</COREF> is *PRO* go to church -- *PRO* appropriate , perhaps , given the enormity of the task 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> national security team face *T*-3 in the days ahead .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do have *-1 to try *PRO*-2 to reduce <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the violee</COREF> and take a turn back for a period of calmness so that <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can move back to a peace process , but even if <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the violence</COREF> subsides , Israelis and Palestinians will still have *-3 to deal with an open wound -- a scar so long and so deep from these last two weeks , 0 it may be years before there is a real effort at *PRO* talking peace again .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Both sides</COREF> have almost stepped back <COREF ID="ABC20001015.1830.0224.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">six years *ICH*-2</COREF> in terms of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> statements and attitudes , <COREF ID="ABC20001015.1830.0224.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">six years</COREF> or more -- before the Oslo accords , when <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the Israelis</COREF> promised land and <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the Palestinians</COREF> promised security *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> there is <COREF ID="ABC20001015.1830.0224.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">only finger pointing</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Arafat</COREF> deliberately launched <COREF ID="ABC20001015.1830.0224.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in order *PRO*-1 to attract the attention of the world by *PRO*-2 paying with the blood of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own people .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> urge <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Barak</COREF> *PRO*-1 to lift the siege of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Palestinians</COREF> , to speak to <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the Palestinians</COREF> as <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> neighbors because <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> neighbors .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">The Palestinians</COREF> clearly face the greatest pressure in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">this summit</COREF> , since <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the Israelis</COREF> are not the only ones blaming <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> for the outbreak of violence .
I think 0 we all know that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Arafat</COREF> is in charge of the Palestinian Authority .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has the responsibility for *PRO* <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">controlling</COREF> <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the violence</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> may not be so easy for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Arafat</COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , thousands of Palestinians are calling for continued fighting .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Half of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the Palestinian population</COREF></COREF> is under the age of 14 and many have been influenced *-1 by military factions like Hamas and Hezbollah -- not by <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Arafat</COREF> .
When you talk about <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Arafat</COREF> and the people around <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-1 , you have *-2 to understand how young <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">this population</COREF> really is *T*-3 -- how volatile , how close to exploding <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> really is *T*-4 .
Almost no one seems *-1 optimistic about the future of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the Mideast</COREF> .
0 That 's the heartbreak of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this region</COREF> says *T*-1 one State Department official .
Whenever you take a step forward *T*-1 , you are bound *-2 to be pushed *-3 way back .
