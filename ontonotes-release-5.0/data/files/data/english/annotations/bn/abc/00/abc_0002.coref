Finally this evening -- the auctioneers .
Here in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the gigantic international auction house</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sotheby 's</COREF></COREF> pleaded *PRO*-1 guilty to <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">price - fixing</COREF> with <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Christie 's</COREF> -- <COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> only real competition in an industry that *T*-2 does $ 4 billion *U* in business every year</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is a case of the rich and the powerful stifling competition .
Here is *T*-1 <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">ABC 's</COREF> Aaron Brown</COREF> .
Sold * for $ 200,000 *U* .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Diana Brooks</COREF> was at home on center stage in the toney world of high - priced art .
As <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">President of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Sotheby 's</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> often conducted the biggest *RNR*-1 , the highest profile *RNR*-1 auctions , like the Kennedy family treasures , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> .
Sold * for $ 95,000 *U* .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> took center stage in a far grittier place , *PRO*-1 pleading *PRO*-2 guilty to *PRO* bilking hundreds of wealthy art patrons out of tens of millions of dollars .
Those charged * engaged in classic cartel behavior -- price fixing , pure and simple .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">The cartel</COREF> consisted of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Sotheby 's</COREF> and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Christie 's</COREF> .
*PRO*-1 <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Arch rivals</COREF> for nearly three centuries , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the two auction houses</COREF> agreed *PRO*-1 to fix prices on what <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> charged *T*-2 the buyers and sellers of high - priced art .
Even arch rivals , it seems , have a common bond .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Sotheby 's</COREF> and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Christie 's</COREF></COREF> are all about money .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are dealing with <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">art , history and beautiful things</COREF> , but at the end of the day , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> go to <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Sotheby 's</COREF> and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Christie 's</COREF></COREF> because <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> believe 0 <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can get best price for <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have already agreed *PRO*-1 to pay more than $ 500 million *U* *PRO*-2 to settle the civil suits spawned * by <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> crimes .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Brooks , who *T*-1 could go to prison and will certainly be heavily fined *-2</COREF> has agreed *PRO*-3 to turn state 's evidence , *PRO*-3 turning against <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> boss .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> becomes Sammy `` the bull '' Gravano with better taste , and <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the art world</COREF> , well , while *PRO*-1 being more careful , perhaps , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> continues *-1 to do business with <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the same two companies who for years *T*-2 swindled <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> .
I think 0 the impact has been negligible .
Much to a lot of people 's surprise , business seems *-1 to be booming .
<COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Consignments</COREF> still seem *-1 to be as high as <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were *?* before <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the scandal</COREF> broke .
Which *T*-1 may be the clearest proof *ICH*-2 yet that the rich are different from the rest of us .
$ 1.3 million *U* .
