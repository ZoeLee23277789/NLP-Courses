<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">The Bridgestone / Firestone Company</COREF> <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> blamed a combination of factors for the flawed tires linked * to more than 150 deaths .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone</COREF> says 0 there was a design flaw .
The pockets between the tread on the tire shoulder are too steep .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">The company</COREF> also blamed <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">consumers who *T*-1 underinflate <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> tires</COREF> , Ford -- for *PRO* recommending a low tire pressure and the manufacturing process at <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">one plant in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Decatur , Illinois</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ABC20001219.1830.0368.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">ABC 's</COREF> Bob Jamieson</COREF> is in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Decatur</COREF> tonight .
Few workers were inside <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Decatur</COREF> plant</COREF> <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> , *PRO*-1 virtually closed for the next two weeks because <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone</COREF> sales have plummeted .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone 's</COREF> finding that the process , not the quality of workmanship that brought about <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the failures</COREF></COREF> has brought a sense of relief .
Many feared that <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone</COREF> would close the plants for work .
It *EXP*-1 's always been a concern , *PRO* being pointed to *-2 and singled *-2 out as a problem plant .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone</COREF> is <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Decatur 's</COREF> third - largest employer .
Though one - fourth of the workers were laid *-1 off , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the tiremaker</COREF> still employs 1,400 .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's very good news .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's very good news for us .
Economic Development Director Richard Eggars lobbied <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone</COREF> *PRO*-1 to keep <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the plant</COREF> *PRO*-2 open .
In terms of payroll and selective services , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone</COREF> infuses approximately $ 5 million *U* a month into the local economy .
But in the tidy , modest neighborhoods where <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone</COREF> workers live *T*-1 , the damage has already been done *-2 .
Until <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the problems</COREF> , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone</COREF> was a family business for <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the Coppenbargers</COREF> .
<COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Richard and Shirley , together</COREF> , have nearly 60 years on the job .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Richard Jr.</COREF> had 14 months , before <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was laid *-1 off in October .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">The job</COREF> -- <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a big history here in <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the family</COREF> , so *PRO* to speak , *PRO* following <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> parents</COREF> here .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> job meant more *ICH*-1 to <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> than just a paycheck .
<COREF ID="ABC20001219.1830.0368.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am worried .
<COREF ID="ABC20001219.1830.0368.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd like *PRO*-1 to finish out until <COREF ID="ABC20001219.1830.0368.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> actual retirement , when <COREF ID="ABC20001219.1830.0368.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was really ready *PRO*-2 to quit *T*-3 , but , yeah , <COREF ID="ABC20001219.1830.0368.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have some doubts .
It is an uncertain Christmas here .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">The report</COREF> absolves <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the workers</COREF> , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> jobs will only be safe if <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Firestone</COREF> restores faith in <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> products and sells more tires .
