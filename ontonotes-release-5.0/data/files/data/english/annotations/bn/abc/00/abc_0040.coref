Good evening .
That call to order 0 you just heard *T*-1 reverberates through <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> every day that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the justices</COREF> convene *T*-2 , but <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> was no everyday session .
Never before has <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the United States Supreme Court</COREF> taken up <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">a case that *T*-1 could decide a presidential election</COREF> *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> did *?* <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">That session of <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF></COREF> and two defeats for <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF> in <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> courts dominate the news <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .
We start with <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. Supreme Court</COREF> , specifically at issue , an appeal *ICH*-1 from <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the campaign of <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">George W. Bush</COREF></COREF> that <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Florida Supreme Court</COREF> had exceeded <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> authority</COREF> when <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">ruled</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> counties could have more time 0 *PRO*-4 to hand - count ballots *T*-3 *T*-2 .
Throughout an hour and a half of argument , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the justices</COREF> were aggressive in *PRO*-1 peppering lawyers with questions , and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> seemed *-2 interested on two issues .
Was there a federal issue *ICH*-1 involved * that *T*-2 would even require <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. Supreme Court</COREF> *PRO*-3 to rule ? and if so , did <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Florida Supreme Court</COREF> improperly rewrite <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> law , as <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Governor Bush</COREF> contends *?* ?
A sure sign of the historic nature of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the day 's</COREF> proceeding</COREF> , for the first time ever , <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> immediately released an audiotape of the arguments .
But in <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the courtroom</COREF> , *PRO*-2 listening in person was *T*-1 <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">ABC 's Jackie Judd</COREF> .
Even now , hours after <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">that hearing</COREF> ended , there are still <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">protesters circling <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* As boisterous as <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the protesters</COREF> were *?* , nothing intruded on the ritual inside .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">The chief justice</COREF> and the associate justices of <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court of the United States</COREF> .</COREF>
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">The courtroom</COREF> was packed *-1 .
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore 's</COREF> top campaign aides , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> children , Republican senators and congressmen , they were all there .
God save the United States and <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">this honorable court</COREF> .
First up , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ted Olson</COREF> <COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">lawyer for <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">George W. Bush</COREF></COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-1 laying out <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the campaign 's</COREF> main claim .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Olson</COREF> made it through only 56 seconds of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> arguments before a justice broke in .
Well , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Olson</COREF> --
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Sandra Day O'Connor , often the swing vote on <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">this court</COREF></COREF> , demanded *PRO*-1 to know why <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> even had a role in <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Olson</COREF> argued that a century - old federal statute prevents laws governing an election from *PRO* being created *-1 after the fact which *T*-2 , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> claimed 0 *?* , is just what <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> court</COREF> did *T*-3 , and also , that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. Constitution</COREF> gives state legislatures , not the courts , the right *PRO* to choose electors .
Of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">all the justices</COREF> it was Ruth Bader Ginsburg who *T*-1 seemed *-2 most sympathetic to <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Florida Supreme Court</COREF> .
Midway through <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the hearing</COREF> , <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">Chief Justice Rehnquist</COREF> seemed *-1 to scold <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> colleagues for *PRO*-2 being too talkative when <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made an unusual offer to the lawyer representing <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's</COREF> Attorney General *T*-3 .
And so it went on .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Laurence Tribe</COREF> , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Gore 's</COREF> attorney</COREF></COREF> , said 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the state court</COREF> did nothing illegal .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> simply provided a way for a close election to be examined *-1 .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Justice O'Connor</COREF> again , but *PRO* this time suggesting 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the state court</COREF> had overstepped <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> authority</COREF> and perhaps there was a federal case here .
<COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">Justice Antonin Scalia</COREF> also pressed <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Tribe</COREF> .
<COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the state court</COREF> <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">relied</COREF> on the Florida Constitution *PRO*-1 to draft <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> decision</COREF> , *PRO*-1 excluding state lawmakers and <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> violated <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. Constitution</COREF> .
It was Justice Breyer who *T*-1 asked the most straightforward question of all .
What *T*-1 happens if <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> rules in favor of <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> ?
The answer from the Secretary of State 's lawyer was , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> wins and all the litigation in <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> ends .
Not everyone agrees .
They say that no matter which way <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> rules *T*-1 , it will not provide nearly so much finality to this presidential election .
Charlie ?
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Jackie Judd at <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> .</COREF>
Our thanks .
