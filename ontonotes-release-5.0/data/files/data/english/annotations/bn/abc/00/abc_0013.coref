<COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll begin with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole</COREF> . ''
There has been <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the first break in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Morton Dean</COREF> reports in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">The investigation into <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the attack which *T*-1 crippled <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF></COREF></COREF> took a positive turn when Yemeni investigators <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">discovered</COREF> bomb making equipment in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">a house said *PRO* to be close to the port where <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> is anchored *-4 *T*-2</COREF> *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">The two men who *T*-1 briefly lived in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the house</COREF></COREF> are reportedly missing .
Yemeni authorities say 0 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the men , not believed *PRO* to be Yemenis</COREF> , are linked *-1 to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the attack</COREF> .
Eyewitnesses say 0 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the attack</COREF> was caused *-1 by two men on a suicide mission .
U.S. sources confirm key details of the report tonight , but Ambassador Barbara Bodine would only say 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the investigation</COREF> is progressing .
Throughout <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this investigation</COREF> we 're going *-1 to be making significant progress day to day and certainly from yesterday to <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> , it has been a quantum leap .
How destructive <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the bomb</COREF> was *T*-1 became even more painfully apparent <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Six more bodies</COREF> have been recovered *-1 .

<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just felt a large -- not so much a bang , but it seemed , to <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , from where <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was *T*-1 , it seemed like something had rammed <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> .
Now that <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">investigators</COREF> have had <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> first major break</COREF> , the confidence level here has risen , but U.S. officials still warn 0 a long investigation lies ahead .

<COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> will have live coverage of tomorrow 's memorial service for the sailors who *T*-1 died on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole</COREF> , '' Eastern time .
