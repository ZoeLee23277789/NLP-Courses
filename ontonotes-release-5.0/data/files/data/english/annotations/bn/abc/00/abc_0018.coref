<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The attack on <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole ''</COREF> in Yemen</COREF> is being reassessed *-1 tonight .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">ABC 's</COREF> Barry Serafin is in our Washington Bureau .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> gather 0 the thing that <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy</COREF> is looking at *T*-1 is the actual timing .
We were led *-1 *PRO*-2 to believe that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the attack</COREF> occurred just as <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole ''</COREF> was tying up .
Not true , apparently ?
Not true , according to new information now released * by <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy</COREF> , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">The Navy</COREF> now says 0 <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> was actually moored *-1 nearly two hours before <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the explosion</COREF> took place .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was , in fact , in the process of *PRO*-1 being refueled *-2 at the time of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the blast</COREF> .
The original scenario was the theory was that RTJ C World News / <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Peter Jennings</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">ABC</COREF> % RTJ ! had <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">slipped</COREF> in as part of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the mooring operation</COREF> .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> was not true .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">The ship</COREF> was tied *-1 up .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was in a very vulnerable position as <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was being refueled *-1 .
However , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy</COREF> now says that <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">hands on <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">deck</COREF> who *T*-1 were manning machine guns , as part of an alert</COREF> , still believed 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had seen <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">this small boat</COREF> as part of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the mooring operation</COREF> , and that is apparently why <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were not suspicious *T*-2 .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> understand the last point again .
If <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was not part of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the mooring operation</COREF> , does it mean 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was lost *-1 in a cluster of boats or operating clear to sea ?
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was a small boat that *T*-1 at that point , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> , should not have been approaching <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">this ship</COREF> , but apparently <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the hands on <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">deck</COREF> who *T*-2 were supposed *-3 to be maintaining security</COREF> , believed 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was a small boat 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had seen *T*-4 earlier as part of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the mooring operation</COREF> , and therefore did not view <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as a suspicious boat .
Thanks very much .
It *ICH*-1 often happens in a case like this , as time goes on , 0 the assessment changes .
Today , the bodies of the last four sailors recovered * from <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the `` Cole ''</COREF> were sent *-1 home to the United States .
17 sailors were killed *-1 in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the blast</COREF> .
At Arlington National Cemetery , the first of the funerals .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Cheron Gunn from Rex , Georgia</COREF> was buried *-1 next to <COREF ID="119" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> ship mate</COREF> <COREF ID="119" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Richard Costello</COREF> of Morrisville , Pennsylvania .
