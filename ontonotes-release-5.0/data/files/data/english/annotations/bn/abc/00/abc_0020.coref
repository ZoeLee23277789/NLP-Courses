The remains of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">four sailors killed * in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole '' bombing</COREF></COREF> returned to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were the last of the dead 0 *T*-1 to be flown *-2 home , but in Yemen , the search for those responsible for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the bombing</COREF> continues .
Investigators turned up new evidence and more leads <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">ABC 's</COREF> John Miller</COREF> reports .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Investigators</COREF> have searched at least half a dozen homes around <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the port of <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Aden</COREF></COREF> including <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this one</COREF> , *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to retrace the movements of what <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> believe 0 *T*-3 may be <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">six or more suspects</COREF> .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">This house on Al Zaharah Street half a mile from <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the port</COREF></COREF> is where investigators believe 0 <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the bomb</COREF> was built *-1 into <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the boat that *T*-2 carried <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> *T*-3 .
Just after <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the men</COREF> moved in , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">neighbors</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> erected <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">a metal corrugated wall</COREF> *PRO*-1 to block <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the neighbors '</COREF> view of the yard .
Investigators say 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the men who *T*-1 lived here</COREF> worked on <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the boat</COREF> behind <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">these walls</COREF> in the last few days of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> stay almost constantly .
At first , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">neighbors</COREF> were curious , but later <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> complained about the noise .
On the day of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the bombing</COREF> , neighbors saw <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the boat</COREF> leaving through these gates *PRO*-1 pulled *-2 by a Nissan 4 x 4 truck .
The trip from <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the house</COREF> to the harbor was only about a mile , then six miles by water to the spot where <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the American destroyer</COREF> was refueling *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">FBI agents and divers</COREF> were collecting evidence near the place 0 <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> believe 0 <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the boat</COREF> was lowered *-1 into the water just before <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the attack on <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole ''</COREF> which *T*-2 killed 17 sailors and two suicide bombers</COREF> *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Investigators</COREF> have come up with a series of <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">names of possible suspects found * on papers in the houses and cars 0 <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> searched *T*-1</COREF> .
In some cases , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have some names .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have not been able *PRO*-1 to verify whether <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're accurate , true names .
In other cases , I do n't believe 0 <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have identities yet .
Yemeni sources say 0 some of the bombers may have used ID cards issued * by a government registration center 35 miles from <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Aden</COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , at the walled - in headquarters of <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">the government security agency</COREF> , the manager of <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">that center</COREF> and several clerks who *T*-1 worked there were among dozens who *T*-2 have been detained and questioned *-3 .
Investigators are aware that a few weeks before <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the bombing</COREF> , <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">accused terrorist leader Osama Bin Laden</COREF> released a videotape calling for holy war against Americans in the Gulf .
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">American investigators</COREF> also say 0 the way 0 <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the bombers</COREF> organized the plot in <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Aden</COREF> *T*-1 has stark similarities to the way 0 <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Bin Laden 's</COREF> cells have operated in the past *T*-2 , but , <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> concede , 0 while <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are closer to *PRO*-3 learning the names of <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the bombers</COREF> , <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are still a long way from *PRO*-4 knowing or proving who *T*-5 sent <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
