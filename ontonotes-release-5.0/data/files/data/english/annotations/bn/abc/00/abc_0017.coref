As for the animals , when it comes to genetically engineered animals *T*-1 , the law 's having an even tougher time *PRO* keeping pace with science .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">A U.S. company</COREF> is seeking government permission *PRO* to bring genetically altered fish to America 's kitchens .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Kevin Newman</COREF> reports from <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">a Canadian province</COREF> .
For as long as <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've told stories , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">fishermen on <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this Canadian island province</COREF></COREF> have shared tales of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> catch .
Lobster in recent years , but not too long ago , <COREF ID="25" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">another delicacy</COREF> -- <COREF ID="25" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">salmon</COREF> .
Oh , yeah , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> used *-1 to get <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">salmon</COREF> in the spring , but <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't see <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> anymore .
I think 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are pretty well wiped *-1 out .
But only two miles away , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Atlantic salmon</COREF> <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> thriving , and <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's an understatement .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">These experimental salmon</COREF> are on the cutting edge of the debate over genetically engineered food because <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">a company</COREF> has found a way 0 *PRO* to make <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the bigger one</COREF> use growth hormone more efficiently *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> reaches full size faster .
How old is this fish *T*-1 ?
You 're looking at <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">2 1 / 2 years</COREF> .
How old is this fish *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Same age .</COREF>
It *EXP*-1 is up to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the Food and Drug Administration</COREF> *PRO* to decide if <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> will be the first genetically engineered beings 0 *T*-2 to make it to your dinner table .
But is <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">that agency</COREF> also capable of *PRO* judging what impact *ICH*-2 it may have *T*-1 on other species ?
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Senior government wildlife experts</COREF> have <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> doubts .
I think 0 it *EXP*-2 's asking more of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the FDA</COREF> than it should be asked *-1 *PRO* to turn <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> into a wildlife agency .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">The FDA</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has hired experts in the field , but unlike wildlife agencies , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the FDA</COREF> keeps <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> research and evaluations *PRO*-1 secret from the public .
Laws do stipulate that there are certain types of material that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need *-2 to hold *T*-1 in confidence .
Which *T*-1 worries some who *T*-2 think 0 it *EXP*-3 's important 0 people know if *PRO* creating <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">supersalmon 0 *T*-4 to feed human appetites</COREF> could threaten normal salmon .
We have shown 0 <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">a tremendous potential *PRO* to upset <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the balance of <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">nature</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">The company producing <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the supersalmon</COREF></COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can solve <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">that problem</COREF> by *PRO*-2 engineering fish that *T*-1 never mate , but <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the balance of <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">nature</COREF></COREF> grows more complicated and controversial , the deeper man explores the power of creation .
