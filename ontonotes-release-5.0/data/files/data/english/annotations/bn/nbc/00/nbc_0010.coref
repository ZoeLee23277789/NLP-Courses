In the waters off the coast of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> , two urgent missions tonight collecting evidence from <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the suicide bombing</COREF> and retrieving <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">bodies still buried * in debris</COREF> .
316 were aboard <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole ''</COREF> when the terrorists <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">struck</COREF> *T*-1 .
Dozens were injured *-1 .
17 were killed *-1 .
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> coverage begins with <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">NBC 's</COREF> Joe Johns</COREF> .
A plane carrying the bodies of five dead American sailors from <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole ''</COREF> arrived <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> at Dover Air Force Base , as <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the first wave of forensics experts and investigators from the Department of Defense and <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF></COREF> arrived in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> mission -- *PRO* to continue <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the search for evidence and suspects in <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the explosion</COREF></COREF> .
Also on the way , equipment 0 *T*-1 to lift <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the `` Cole ''</COREF> out of the water and specialists 0 *PRO*-2 to help *PRO* retrieve <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the bodies of those trapped * and presumed *PRO* dead</COREF> .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> know 0 there are <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">spaces that *T*-1 are inaccessible</COREF> .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> know 0 there are <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">some remains in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">those spaces</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> need *-1 to get in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> and locate <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the remains that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> anticipate *PRO*-2 finding *T*-3 there</COREF> .
Though the work was only beginning , <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">a top <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Justice Department</COREF> official in <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF></COREF> predicted the outcome of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the investigation</COREF> .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm confident that we will be able *PRO*-1 to determine who *T*-2 was behind <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the bombing</COREF> and that <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">those people , those organizations</COREF> , will be held *-3 accountable , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will be punished *-4 .
This critical phase of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the investigation</COREF> must be conducted *-1 both above and beneath the water on a tight time line .
They 'll want *PRO*-1 to get in there quickly because one of the problems when you 're dealing with <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">seawater</COREF> *T*-2 is that <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will have an adverse effect on your evidence .
*PRO* To further speed up the process , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the FBI</COREF> has now activated the Strategic Information and Operation Center in <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> , conceived * after the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , *PRO* ensuring the fastest possible exchange of information between investigators and the decision makers .
On the diplomatic front , the U.S. said 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the government of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF></COREF> is cooperating with <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the investigation</COREF> , though <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">that country 's</COREF> President</COREF> disputes charges that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> nation</COREF> is a haven for terrorists .
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">The Justice Department</COREF> says 0 no group or individual has been ruled *-1 out as a suspect , though many expect that whoever *T*-2 gets the blame will eventually be tied *-3 to <COREF ID="136" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the terrorist</COREF> <COREF ID="136" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Osama bin Laden</COREF> .
And the grieving continued <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> at the Naval Academy 's football game against Notre Dame .
A moment of silence *PRO* to remember the victims of <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">this terrorist act</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Joe Johns</COREF> , <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">NBC News</COREF> .
