<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a scene 0 few Serbs would have deemed *T*-1 possible only weeks ago , but <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> almost did n't happen , *PRO*-2 delayed *-3 by <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic 's</COREF> party , which *T*-4 still controls <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the parliament</COREF></COREF> .
After meetings earlier today with a series of foreign dignitaries , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Kostunica</COREF> admitted that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> may be down , but not out .
`` difficult times are behind us , '' <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *?* , `` but the days ahead also hold many trials . ''
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> main priority -- *PRO* bringing <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Serbia</COREF> back into the international community after a decade of economic sanctions .
Many believe 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has the credentials .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">A man who *T*-1 believes in democracy but who *T*-2 holds strong Serb views .</COREF>

In some sense , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *PRO* sort of interfering in the affairs of another state .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Kostunica</COREF> had already publicly said 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would never turn <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> over to the Hague tribunal .

Details have yet *-1 to be revealed *-2 , but at the very least , sources say 0 *?* , there was an exchange of guarantees for <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Kostunica</COREF> , a peaceful hand - over of power , and in return , safety and comfort inside <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Serbia</COREF> for <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> even intends *PRO*-1 to continue <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> political career , as leader of <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> party</COREF> , *PRO*-1 worrying many who *T*-2 opposed <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
As long as <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's on the soil of <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">this state</COREF> , no one will be able *PRO*-1 to sleep quietly .
Tonight , despite poor weather , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">thousands of Serbs</COREF> celebrated a new era of freedom , with the fate of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> former dictator</COREF> still in doubt .
