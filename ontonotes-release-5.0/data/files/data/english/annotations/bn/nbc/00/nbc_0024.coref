Now to the new face and shape of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> .
Republicans are still in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the majority</COREF> , but the election has eaten away at the size of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">that majority</COREF> .
In the House of Representatives , Democrats are likely *PRO*-1 to pick up two seats , and in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> , there could be a historic shift in the balance of power .
Here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">NBC 's</COREF> Lisa Myers</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The first first lady ever elected * to public office</COREF> -- <COREF ID="24" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hillary Clinton</COREF></COREF> becomes an instant celebrity in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> , *PRO*-1 serving alongside Republicans who *T*-2 tried *PRO*-3 to convict <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband during impeachment .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will get a very positive reception .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have worked with a number of the Republican members in the past .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate 's</COREF> top Republican offers an olive branch and some advice .
It *EXP*-1 would be wise for <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> to take a little time 0 *PRO*-3 maybe to just observe things and get used to the process and not try *PRO* to , you know , assert too aggressively <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> obvious celebrity status *T*-2 .
Otherwise , a lot of shell - shocked Republican senators <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> , stunned after *PRO* losing a net three and probably four seats .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The casualties</COREF> -- <COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Roth of Delaware , Abraham of Michigan , Grams of Minnesota , perhaps Gorton of Washington -- though that 's still too close 0 *PRO* to call *T*-1 -- and <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Ashcroft of <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Missouri</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Ashcroft</COREF> lost to <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the first dead man ever elected * to <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">former Governor Mel Carnahan , who *T*-1 perished in a plane crash and whose wife *T*-2 will be appointed *-3 to <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> seat</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Missouri</COREF> is a compassionate state , and I think 0 in a very special way , <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have demonstrated the compassion which <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *T*-1 .
The strong likelihood of a 50 / 50 tie in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> , which *T*-1 would be unprecedented , sent historians and parliamentarians *PRO*-2 scrambling for answers .
If <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> wins , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Dick Cheney</COREF> , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Vice President</COREF> , would break ties in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> wins , <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">Lieberman</COREF> would resign <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> seat and almost certainly be <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">replaced</COREF> *-1 by a Republican , appointed * by Connecticut 's Republican governor .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> would give Republicans a 51 majority .
Either way , every vote is critical every day .
I jokingly said 0 the most important person in <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Capitol</COREF> is <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Capitol</COREF> physician</COREF> , *PRO*-1 making *PRO* *EXP*-2 sure 0 <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> takes the pulse of every senator every morning .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">Democrats</COREF> demand more power , *PRO* reflecting <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> new equal numbers .
<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> recognize *RNR*-1 and I hope 0 they recognize *RNR*-1 that the only way that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> will accomplish anything *T*-2 is through bipartisanship .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The sharply divided Congress</COREF> only complicates the task of <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the new Prez</COREF> .
Whether <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> or <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> , many here say 0 <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may quickly find that *PRO* getting elected *-1 was the easy part .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Lisa Myers</COREF> , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">NBC News</COREF> , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Capitol</COREF> .
