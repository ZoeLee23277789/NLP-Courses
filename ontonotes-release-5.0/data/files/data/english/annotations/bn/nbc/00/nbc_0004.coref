Time for `` Lifeline '' -- and fresh evidence *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> 0 the kind of medical care 0 you receive *T*-2 depends to a large degree on where you live *T*-3 , but maybe not for the reasons 0 you 'recg *T*-4 .
It 's not just poor *RNR*-1 versus rich *RNR*-1 areas or rural versus urban .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">NBC 's</COREF> Robert Hager</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> on `` geographic destiny . ''
When <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Florence Kramer</COREF> discovered 0 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had breast cancer *T*-1 , a doctor in Farmington , Missouri , told <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> needed <COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a mastectomy</COREF> -- <COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">breast removal</COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> panicked and was frightened , and real depressed and upset .
But 70 miles away in St. Louis , doctors told <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">a less invasive lumpectomy</COREF> , should be enough .
Man , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was overjoyed .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> lumpectomy</COREF> , was a success , and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> case an example of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the startling differences in doctors ' choices of treatment , from one geographic area to the next</COREF> .
It 's all documented in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">an ongoing statistical analysis called * *PRO*-1 `` the Dartmouth College Atlas of Health Care , '' directed * by Dr John Wennberg</COREF> .
What we 're seeing *T*-1 is that in health care geography is basically destiny , *PRO* meaning 0 you may be destined *-2 , if you live in one community , *PRO*-3 to have major surgery for the same problem normally treated , somewhere else , with a less invasive procedure or without surgery at all .
For instance , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the Atlas</COREF> finds , 0 a breast cancer patient in Rapid City , South Dakota is twice as likely *PRO* to have a mastectomy , as a patient with the same problem in the western suburbs of Cleveland .
Prostate cancer , in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , surgery , nine times more likely than in Binghamton , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> .
Heart disease , in Bloomington , Indiana , bypass operation , three times more likely , than in Albuquerque , New Mexico .
A back problem , in Santa Barbara , California , surgery six times more likely , than in Bronx , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> .
Why these great variations ?
Not what you may think *T*-1 .
Not the size of the community , the wealth of the patients , or quality of the hospital .
It <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">seems</COREF> *-1 to be more what doctors in each area are used to *PRO* recommending *T*-2 , but patients do n't know <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
The problem of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">this incredible variation</COREF> is *PRO* to get <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the patients</COREF> involved * in *PRO* making decisions that *T*-1 express <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own preferences .
So Dartmouth 's Hitchcock Hospital has what *T*-1 's called *-2 *PRO*-3 a `` shared decision making center , '' where patients are carefully presented *-4 all the options even shown *-4 videos *T*-5 , and in Pennsylvania , a patient advocate has this advice -- when <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the physician</COREF> says , `` <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe 0 you ought *-8 to have <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">this procedure</COREF> *T*-7 , '' the very next question 0 you ask *T*-9 is `` well , why are <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> recommending <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> *T*-10 ? '' and the second question is `` what alternatives would <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> recommend *T*-11 , and what are my choices *T*-6 ? ''
Just why <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Florence Kramer</COREF> traveled 70 miles for a second opinion *T*-1 .
If <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm going *-1 to have <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">something</COREF> done *-2 to <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> body <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-3 to know about <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to know everything 0 *ICH*-4 there is *T*-2 0 *PRO* to know *T*-3 about <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
How <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> overcame geographic destiny avoided a mastectomy and remains cancer free , today *T*-1 .
