As we heard *?* from David Gregory , one of Governor Bush 's main themes in these last days of the campaign is getting rid *-6 of partisan gridlock in Washington , which *T*-1 was exactly what <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> was talking about *T*-2 today -- an attempt *PRO* to reopen <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">debate on a $ 240 billion *U* tax cut plan</COREF> , *PRO*-3 saying 0 <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the version 0 House Republicans passed *T*-5</COREF> is unacceptable , because <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is unfair *ICH*-4 , according to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> , to children and seniors .
Instead of *PRO* meeting us on common ground , instead of *PRO* working with the White House or congressional Democrats , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican leadership</COREF> closed <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> doors</COREF> to compromise -- literally closed <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the doors</COREF> to compromise .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> crafted <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own partisan tax package</COREF> and passed <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> last night on a party - line vote .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Republican leaders</COREF> for <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> part said 0 *PRO* reopening <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the tax debate</COREF> is not now realistic and <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the tax cut bill</COREF> is probably tombed *-1 .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are angry that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> is threatening *PRO*-1 to veto <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-2 saying 0 it *EXP*-3 's wrong *PRO* to have political budget battles right before the election .
