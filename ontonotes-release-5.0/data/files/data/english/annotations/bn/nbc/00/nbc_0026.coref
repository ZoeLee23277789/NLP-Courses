<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">NBC 's</COREF> Claire Shipman</COREF> now with <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Vice President 's</COREF> day back in Washington .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Claire ?</COREF>
Sources tell <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF> has not made up <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mind how far <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will push the effort in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> *T*-1 .
Certainly what his team <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> still think 0 <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could win .
As for the courts , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're told *-1 0 that decision is not likely *PRO*-2 to be made *-3 until November 17th , when the final tally is in *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF> , in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">a deliberate attempt *PRO* to publicly relax , in the midst of tension of the highest order</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-1 to win <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">this game</COREF> .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> were ahead 6 , so <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm very optimistic .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're talking about <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the touch football game</COREF> .
Sources say 0 <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> team</COREF></COREF> are also still optimistic about a win in the recount , because <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> believe 0 a manual count will turn up mistakes in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gore 's</COREF> favor .
Meanwhile , the <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> team today asserting 0 there is still a lot of work 0 *T*-1 to be done *-2 before *PRO* naming <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the President - elect</COREF> .
I hope 0 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">all Americans</COREF> agree 0 the will of <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> , not a computer glitch should select <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> next President</COREF> .
I think 0 <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> pledged <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">ourselves</COREF> *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to keep the rhetoric *PRO*-3 as low as possible , given the situation , and try to carry it out in a professional way .
Why ?
As <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> considers <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> options with <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> family</COREF> , advisers say 0 <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and the campaign</COREF> realize 0 <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are operating on two distinct and delicate tracts -- legal , which <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will pursue *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to keep options *PRO*-3 open , and political , which <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-4 to watch *T*-5 carefully as <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> feel mounting pressure .
Friends point out that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the man who *T*-1 was so quick *PRO* to concede the first time to George W. Bush when <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> lost *T*-2 and who *T*-3 told aides , `` we have *-4 to do this right</COREF> , '' is not a politician who *T*-5 would insist on <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">a long , damaging legal process</COREF> , if it *EXP*-6 is determined 0 <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's what *PRO* going to court would mean *T*-8 .
Bill Clinton called <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF> today *PRO*-1 to talk to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , less *ICH*-2 to offer advice than support .
Finally , friends tell <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> that <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> and <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> family</COREF></COREF> are also focused on the --
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> believe 0 depending on what *T*-1 happens , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">has</COREF> a strong platform *ICH*-3 right now from which *PRO* to launch a presidential bid in the year 2000 *T*-2 had , and <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is part of the calculation .
Tom ?
Thanks very much , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Claire Shipman</COREF> <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> .
