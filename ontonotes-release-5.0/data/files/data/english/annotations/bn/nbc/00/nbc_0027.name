While the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> campaigns struggle over the outcome of the presidential election , tomorrow , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , a high profile ceremony will be held on the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mall</ENAMEX> to mark the overdue beginning of a <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> memorial , but not even that moment is without controversy .
Here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Miklaszewski</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> preparations for a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Veterans Day</ENAMEX> tribute , many believe is long overdue .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">55 years</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> defeated <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , a groundbreaking on <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the National Mall</ENAMEX> , for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> ever national memorial to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> vet and chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hayden Wiiams</ENAMEX> calling it a fitting legacy to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> who served in the war .
We were fighting for freedom , not only for us but for others .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 141 million</ENAMEX> , mostly private donations , the monument will feature pillars that form an open circle .
Gold stars will commemorate the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> killed in the war , but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> , nothing in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> comes easy .
The planning alone for this memorial has lasted longer than it took to win <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> , and now , the monument itself is caught up in controversy .
Not whether to build it , but where .
It 's the right time .
It 's the wrong site .
A small group of protesters has filed a lawsuit to move the memorial off the present sight .
This is an absolute intrusion .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Graves</ENAMEX> fought the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Nazis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Battle of the Bulge</ENAMEX> and believes the new memorial would detract from the other monuments .
We do not want our legacy to be a controversy .
Other vets however , like former senator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> , say it 's not only the right place , it 's about time .
I do n't -- there would n't be any sight .
But the controversy sounds all too familiar .
Partisan bickering , public protests , even lawsuits .
That 's what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> is all about , and it 's why <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> now remembers those who fought and won <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> .
