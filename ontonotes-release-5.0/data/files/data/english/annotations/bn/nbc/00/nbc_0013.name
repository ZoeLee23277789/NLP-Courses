Meanwhile , the director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FBI</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Louis Freeh</ENAMEX> , is headed for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> to personally supervise the investigation into the attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the `` USS Cole</ENAMEX> , '' and some progress is being made .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Miklaszewski</ENAMEX> is at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> , with the latest for us now .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> , investigators tonight are still trying to figure out exactly what kind of explosive could cause such devastating damage to the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Cole</ENAMEX> . ''
They 're focusing on an abandoned apartment where bomb - making materials were found , but <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> President claims that the explosive found could only come from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , implying that the materials or the weapon itself were <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> - made .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military and intelligence officials can not confirm his claim .
Authorities also discovered two <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> passports , but quickly determined they were fakes , not surprising to one <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> official , who said everything in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yemen</ENAMEX> 's terrorist underground is a forgery .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom</ENAMEX> ?
Thanks very much , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NBC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Miklaszewski</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Pentagon</ENAMEX> tonight .
