This is <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">The World</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am Tony Kahn .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Novelist and playwright Gao Xingjian</COREF> <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> became the first Chinese language author 0 *T*-1 to win the Nobel Prize for Literature .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gao Xingjian 's</COREF> avant - garde plays made <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> persona non-grata in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> native China</COREF> and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> fled <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> in 1988 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> settled in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF> *PRO*-1 becoming a French citizen two years ago .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Gregory Lee</COREF> is a professor of <COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.1255.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese</COREF> and Chinese literature at <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">the University of Lyons in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Lee</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> gather 0 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF> and know <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> work .
*PRO* Tell <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> a little bit about <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , Who is <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> *T*-1 and why did <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> flee <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gao Xingjian</COREF> is quite an interesting writer because in some senses <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> differs from the great cohort of contemporary Chinese writers that *T*-1 are well known in the West today .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say that the great difference about <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gao Xingjian</COREF> is that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> actually received a university education .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was educated *-1 in French , so has a very good knowledge of French literature and it is very much French literature that *T*-2 has influenced <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own literary creativities , only free production , so much so that conservative Chinese critics would accuse <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> of blind worship of Western models .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Sartre</COREF> is a big man in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Xingjian 's</COREF> life , is n't <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say so that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Sartre</COREF> has been a quite a big influence .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 the other influences would be <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.1255.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Samuel Beckett</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.1255.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Irish and French language writer</COREF> , Unesco</COREF> .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> are models and , of course , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">all of these writers</COREF> are writers who *T*-1 were active in the first half of the twentieth century .
Well , this is very interesting because <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gao</COREF> left <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> before <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">Tianenmen</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> wrote a play , in particular about <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the events there</COREF> .
Would <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> say that <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> influences</COREF> may be more French literary then <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own immediate life experience ?
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say both , in fact , because <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the first play that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wrote *T*-1 that *T*-2 made <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> famous</COREF> was a play that *T*-3 dates from 1981 , which *T*-4 was actually called *-5 *PRO*-6 ` Bus Stop ' , which many people said 0 *T*-7 was based *-8 on the play or had <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">resonances from <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Beckett 's</COREF> play ` *PRO* Waiting for Godot '</COREF></COREF> and <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> concerned a number of Chinese people from different walks of life who *T*-9 were standing at a bus stop *PRO*-10 waiting for a bus that *T*-11 never came .
So , we can see immediately that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the resonances with <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">the play of <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Beckett</COREF></COREF></COREF> , but <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gao Xingjian</COREF> really before <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">1989</COREF> felt that he was restricted *-1 , that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was unable *PRO*-2 to write and to have <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> plays produced *-3 , as <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would wish , and so left <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> couple of years before <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the incident at Tiananmen in <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">1989</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a great day for modern Chinese literature and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a day that *T*-1 has been awaited *-2 for the past 60 to 70 years .

<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> spoke to <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> from <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> home in Provence .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Professor</COREF> , *PRO* thank <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> very much for *PRO* speaking with <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
