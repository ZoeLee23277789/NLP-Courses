Elsewhere in the Middle East , officials from the FBI and the CIA and marine anti-terrorist specialists have arrived in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> *PRO*-1 to investigate yesterday 's explosion that *T*-2 crippled the <COREF ID="15" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">US Navy</COREF> destroyer</COREF> , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Cole</COREF> .
Seven sailors are confirmed *-1 dead and ten of the missing are now presumed *-2 dead .
The wounded have been evacuated *-1 to Germany and to <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">neighboring Djibouti</COREF> .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Djibouti</COREF> is where until last year <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy</COREF> conducted <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Red Sea refueling operations</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20001013.2000.0896.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Moore</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20001013.2000.0896.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a former government intelligence analyst</COREF></COREF> says 0 it *ICH*-1 was a mistake for <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">those operations</COREF> to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">move</COREF> to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Aden</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> tend *-1 to fault <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the US policy that *T*-2 brought <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the refueling activity</COREF> from <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Djibouti</COREF> to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Aden</COREF></COREF> , given the abundance of threat indicators in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the country , that being Yemen</COREF> .
It *ICH*-2 has been known *-1 for some time that various groups , either Palestinians , North African groups , some of Bin Laden 's men actively reside in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> , so again , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> really question the wisdom of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">that policy</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> say that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> was using <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Djibouti</COREF> for more or less the same purposes that , for the last year or so , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have been using <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> *T*-1 , that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> knew that there was a much more anti-American atmosphere in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> .
Why then did <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> go there *T*-1 ?
Did <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have some other overriding concerns ?
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">The US</COREF> has been <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">attempting</COREF> *PRO*-1 to support movements for democratization in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> and there has been some attempts *PRO* to buttress <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the government of <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Ali Abdullah Saleh</COREF></COREF> and <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is directly tied *-2 into <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
There were <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">elections held * , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe , a year or so ago</COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">The Americans</COREF> were <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">involved</COREF> *-1 as far as *PRO* assessing and evaluating the validity of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the elections</COREF> , and <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> grew out of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">that policy of *PRO* supporting <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the Yemeni government</COREF></COREF> , but again the problem that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the Yemeni government</COREF> faces *T*-2 is 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't actively control <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the countryside</COREF> .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is split *-1 between various tribal groups and there is also , as <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mentioned *?* , <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">extremists that *T*-2 look at <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> as , say , heaven</COREF> .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have been there for well on 20 years , various groups at different times , of course .
In terms of *PRO* talking about <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> and giving <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> a feeling for what *T*-1 is interesting about <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF> , another thing that *T*-2 is interesting about <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would seem *-3 to be that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> a country that *T*-4 had pretty much sided , as I understand it , with Iraq during <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the Gulf War</COREF> .
Is <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> true and if so why is <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> involved *-1 with <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> now *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is true .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">The government of Yemen</COREF> , *PRO*-1 led *-2 by <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="152" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the current President</COREF> <COREF ID="152" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ali Abdullah Saleh</COREF></COREF> , did exhibit pro-Iraqi sentiment during <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the Gulf War</COREF> .
As far as the reasoning behind why <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> is trying *PRO*-1 to rebuild <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> ties with <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> *T*-2 , again <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the US policy</COREF> is *PRO* to try *PRO*-3 to build a bridge with <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">as many countries as possible within a region , particularly the Islamic world</COREF> .
<COREF ID="PRI20001013.2000.0896.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> hope 0 <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the countries</COREF> can become potential friends , if not allies , in the region .
So there is a bit of , ok , yes <COREF ID="PRI20001013.2000.0896.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't agree with what you did *T*-1 in the past , but *PRO* let <COREF ID="PRI20001013.2000.0896.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> try *PRO*-2 to put that behind <COREF ID="PRI20001013.2000.0896.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> and look forward .
And what have the developments there led <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *PRO*-1 to believe *T*-2 about the wisdom of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">that policy</COREF> ?
The wisdom of *PRO* <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">trying</COREF> *PRO*-1 to establish ties with <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the Yemeni government</COREF> , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can certainly see the logic behind <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
Again <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> specific question comes in to why <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> moved <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the refueling activity</COREF> from <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Djibouti</COREF> to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Aden</COREF> *T*-1 , given the level of threat in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is one thing *PRO* to build relationships , it *EXP*-2 is another thing *PRO* to put actually <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">your men and women</COREF> on the front line , when <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't have *-3 to be there *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">John Moore</COREF> is a research analyst at the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> joined <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> in <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> studios here in Boston .
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> very much .
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
