<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is The World .
I am Lisa Mullins .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">The United States</COREF> is the heavyweight champion of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> when it comes to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the internet</COREF> *T*-1 .
Now based on past experience , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 'd think 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the main challenger for the crown</COREF> would be Japan .
Well , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> would be wrong .
When it comes to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the internet</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> could have been a contender .
This week in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> , a blue ribbon advisory panel wrapped up proposals aimed * at *PRO* turning <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> into an information technology powerhouse by 2005 .
We asked <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The World 's</COREF> Lucy Craft</COREF> *PRO*-1 to find out how fast <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese</COREF> will have *-2 to drive *T*-3 *PRO*-2 to catch up to the Americans on <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the information superhighway</COREF> .
By all appearances , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> would seem *-2 a natural candidate 0 *T*-1 to be the next <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">internet</COREF> superpower .
At this recent technology trade show in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> , for example , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">NTT Docomell</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan 's</COREF> biggest cell phone maker</COREF></COREF> touted <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> latest model .
By next year <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">callers</COREF> will be able *PRO*-1 to see *RNR*-2 as well as hear *RNR*-2 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">each other</COREF> , thanks to the addition of a tiny video monitor .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">The country that *T*-1 gave <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> VCRs , the Walkman and video games</COREF> continues *-2 to churn out entertainment related devices .
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">One of this Christmas season 's hottest items</COREF> is this .
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">A consumer version of a DJ 's night club turntable , complete with simulated scraps , sounds and effects buttons .</COREF>
Whether it is cell phones , digital cameras or flat TV screens , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> continues *-1 to dominate many sectors of technology and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> manufacturing expertise is still world - class , and yet , it 's something of a paradox but after a decade of explosive <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">internet</COREF> growth around <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> , only one in five <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese</COREF> goes on line .
It *EXP*-1 is very difficult *PRO* to rationally explain why because visibly it does n't make sense .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Daniels</COREF> is President of <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jupiter Telecommunications</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan 's</COREF> largest cable operator</COREF></COREF> .
You would think that <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">companies</COREF> are so knowledgeable , so educated , so technically literate that <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would be at the forefront of the development .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> access fees here</COREF> run as much as 10 times as high as in the West , thanks to a near monopoly held * by <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">NTT</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the politically powerful former state owned telephone company</COREF></COREF> .
Though <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sky high rates</COREF> are why <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese</COREF> do n't go on line as much as citizens elsewhere *T*-1 , but <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Jupiter</COREF> chief Daniels</COREF> says 0 it all comes down to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">conservative , conformist , consensus lobbying Japanese society <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> that *T*-2 's impeding growth of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the internet</COREF> here</COREF> .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it really reverts back in to these traditional values , the way 0 <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese</COREF> are educated *-1 *T*-2 and basically individualism is not encouraged *-3 in neither school setting or corporate setting , and the people who *T*-4 are really making a difference in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> are <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">individuals who *T*-5 are entrepreneurs</COREF> .
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will come up with an idea , <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">take</COREF> the risk and lead .
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are not afraid *PRO*-1 to go against normal traditional ways of *PRO* doing things and <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">taking</COREF> personal risk , and in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> you do n't see <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">that risk factor</COREF> as evident as what you would find *T*-2 in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> .
Which *T*-1 partly explains why <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese political leaders such as Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori</COREF> are in a fix *T*-2 .
Well , *PRO*-1 desperate *PRO*-2 to escape the economic stagnation that *T*-3 has mired <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF> for over a decade , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> also worry that traditional ways of life would be swept *-4 aside by <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the internet</COREF> with dotcom jobs replacing life - long employment security , e-commerce endangering business built * on personal relationships .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> hate *PRO*-1 to see some of the traditional values that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> has always distinguished <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> *T*-2 , starting *-3 to erode .
Again , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Daniels</COREF> .
And there is <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">a conflict that *T*-1 exists</COREF> .
As you start *-1 moving down <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">this path towards technical innovation</COREF> , <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> invites disruption or <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> brings about <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the conflict</COREF> much quicker than <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 most people would be prepared *PRO*-2 to start *-3 dealing with <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 there is a lot of issues that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> is starting *-1 to question *T*-2 , how do <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> adapt *T*-3 , how do <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">change</COREF> *T*-4 , how do <COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> preserve what *T*-5 is good about <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20001129.2000.1255.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> society</COREF> while *PRO*-8 making <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">these changes</COREF> *PRO*-9 to be more competitive with what *T*-6 's happening throughout the rest of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> *T*-7 .
In a crisis , such as right after World War II , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> has proven *-1 adept at rapid change , but in the past drastic reform has always been masterminded *-2 from above by Japanese bureaucrats .
A true <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">internet</COREF> connected society and economy wo n't emerge , say 0 *?* experts , without <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">a grassroots led revolution</COREF> , and <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would be a first with <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">this 2000 - year - old country</COREF> .
For <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The World</COREF> , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am Lucy Craft in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> .
