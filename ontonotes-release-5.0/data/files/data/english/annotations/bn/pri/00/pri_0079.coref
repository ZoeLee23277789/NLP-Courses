This is <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The World</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am Tony Kahn .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gao Xingjian</COREF> arrived in Stockholm <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this week</COREF> and when <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> leaves *T*-1 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese born writer</COREF> will have <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">something extra in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> suitcase</COREF> , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Nobel Prize for Literature</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gao , who *T*-1 now lives in France</COREF> , gave the traditional Nobel lecture as part of the festivities leading up to <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Sunday 's</COREF> ceremony , and on <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the same day</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> collects <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the prize</COREF> .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gao 's</COREF> 1989 novel</COREF> <COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">` Soul Mountain '</COREF></COREF> will be published *-1 for the first time in <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> .
If you want *PRO*-1 to know what <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gao Xingjian</COREF> is all about *T*-2 , as a thinker and as an artist , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> international book critic</COREF> <COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Christopher Meryl</COREF></COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gao 's</COREF> masterpiece</COREF> is an ideal starting point .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> politics are embedded *-1 in <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> writing</COREF> and <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> writing</COREF> is first and foremost a celebration of freedom .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">This novel</COREF> <COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">` soul mountain '</COREF> , which *T*-1 is just being released *-2 in <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this week</COREF></COREF> is in every possible way a celebration of what freedom means *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a large novel , full of all kinds of ideas and incidents and stories and tales and a polyphony of voices .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is , if you like , the whole world wrapped * up in 500 pages .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the world at <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> most carnival - like</COREF> , and yet it is virtually impossible , is n't it *?* , for a Chinese artist to do something or to make <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">a statement</COREF> without <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> having some kind of either political effect or *PRO* be political in origin .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this man</COREF> took <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the trip on which <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the novel</COREF> was based *-1 *T*-2 for political reasons</COREF> , did <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> not *?* ?
Certainly .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is born *-1 in 1940 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is a product of <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the Cultural Revolution</COREF> .
In fact <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had *-1 to burn up an entire suitcase full of hundreds of poems and plays and stories at the start of <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the Cultural Revolution</COREF> in fear of *PRO*-2 going to prison , and then in 1983 after *PRO* being diagnosed *-3 with lung cancer , which *T*-4 had killed <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father three years earlier and being convinced that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> was going *-5 to die , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets a kind of reprieve .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> gets a second chest X-ray , discovers that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't have lung cancer , recognizes that by virtue of the kinds of things that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is writing *T*-1 , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> openness to Western literary ideas , that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is in political trouble again , and so <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> sets out on <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">an extraordinary odyssey of some 15,000 kilometers , mostly on foot , which <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> takes *T*-2 through southwestern China</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had survived , if you will , a death sentence , and now in that new freedom of the life in front of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> takes to the road in the tradition of old Chinese poets and records what <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> sees *T*-1 , what <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> hears *T*-2 , the stories that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is told *-3 *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">The book</COREF> is filled *-1 with marvelous descriptions of the gorges through which <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> walks *T*-2 , the mountains that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> climbs *T*-3 , indeed <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> is called *-4 *PRO*-5 <COREF ID="175" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Soul Mountain</COREF> , <COREF ID="175" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the mountain on which <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> hopes *PRO*-6 in some way or another to get in touch with <COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> soul</COREF> , <COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> individual soul</COREF> , as opposed to that mass kind of soul being enforced * upon <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> by the Communist Chinese authorities , the social realism that the cadres would have <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> write in *T*-7 *T*-8</COREF> .
Not only can <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this fellow</COREF> write , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can paint too , ca n't <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> *?* ?
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is best known *-1 among <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> neighbors in Paris as a painter .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has had more than 30 one - man shows and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> paintings are quite delicately done *-1 and there <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is also very well known *-2 as a playwright .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has published about 18 plays now and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> writes <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> plays in French .
<COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">Just one last thing</COREF> *PRO* quoting <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wonder if <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> could respond to <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Christopher</COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said at the very beginning of <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wonderful speech to the Nobel Prize Committee</COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said , `` <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do not wish *PRO*-1 to waste <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">this talk on literature</COREF> by *PRO* saying too much about politics and history , What <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-2 to do *T*-3 is *PRO* to use this opportunity *PRO*-4 to <COREF ID="PRI20001207.2000.2997.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">speak</COREF> as one writer in the voice of an individual . ''
<COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">Is</COREF> <COREF ID="PRI20001207.2000.2997.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> true basically not only for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="245" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">that day</COREF> , <COREF ID="245" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">today</COREF></COREF></COREF> , but of all of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> work ?
Well , the work that we have *T*-1 so far in English translation suggests <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , and indeed <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">this novel , which *T*-2 is a celebration *ICH*-3 as well of <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">the self of the individual</COREF></COREF> , goes so far as *PRO* to even divide up to <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">the self</COREF> .
Characters proliferate out of the imagination of the narrator so that you have at a certain point , you have a new he , you have a new she , you have a you , and each one of these characters tells stories , each story of which *T*-1 is designed *-2 *PRO*-3 to give you a deeper sense of the richness and the complexity of life in China .

Thanks , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Christopher</COREF> .
