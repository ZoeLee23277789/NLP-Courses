This is <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the World</COREF> .
I 'm Lisa Mullins .
Not since <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">power</COREF> 13 years ago , has <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Yugoslavia 's</COREF> President</COREF> <COREF ID="8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Slobodan Milosevic</COREF></COREF> appeared *-1 so close to *PRO* losing <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> grip began *-1 to slip on September 24th , when as <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">even he</COREF> admitted *?* <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">opposition candidate Vojislav Kostunica</COREF> won more votes in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">a nation - wide election</COREF> *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> claimed , however , that <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Kostunica</COREF> had failed *-1 to win at least 50 % and that another ballot would be necessary .
The opposition insisted that <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Kostunica</COREF> had won outright and staged mass anti-Milosevic demonstrations .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the protest</COREF> reached a climax as <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">hundreds of thousands of people</COREF> took to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the streets of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">The crowds</COREF> took over <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the parliament building</COREF> and <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">a state television center</COREF> and the events of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the day</COREF> resembled nothing so much as a popular revolution .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The World 's</COREF> Nenad Chebeck</COREF> takes <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the streets of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the Serbian capital</COREF></COREF> in <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> eyewitness report .
Rock drummer Dragon Zuricic pounded out a beat for marching and <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">hundreds of thousands of demonstrators</COREF> took up the call .
Within minutes , the center of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the town</COREF> was blocked *-1 *PRO*-2 solid .
Opponents of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Slobodan Milosevic</COREF> called on <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the Yugoslav President</COREF> *PRO*-1 to relinquish power immediately .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">An opposition spokesman</COREF> demanded that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> accept <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the electoral will of the people</COREF> , that the Federal Electoral Commission reveal what <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> called *T*-1 *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the true result of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF></COREF> .
There were speeches and even songs , denouncing <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Slobodan Milosevic</COREF> and praising <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">opposition leader</COREF> , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Vojislav Kostunica</COREF></COREF> , but the singing stopped and at least some shooting began .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">The crowd</COREF> converged at <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the federal parliament building</COREF> and tried *PRO*-1 to storm <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
The police retaliated with tear gas and most streets around the buildings were full of people and tear gas .
The mood became angry and several police cars were smashed *-1 or set *-1 ablaze .
Then <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the demonstrators</COREF> turned <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> fury towards a nearby police station .
That 's when <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the mass protest</COREF> took what *T*-1 may have been a `` turning point *T*-2 '' .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">The police</COREF> gave <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> up without a fight and some of <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> even joined <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the demonstrators</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the crowd</COREF> marched over to <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the state run televison station</COREF> .
Much to <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the demonstrators '</COREF> surprise dozens of heavily armed riot policemen simply walked out of <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the building</COREF> and offered no resistance .
Elsewhere in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF> , <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">journalists at three other television stations and the radio station B92</COREF> took over <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> newsrooms *PRO*-1 vowing *PRO*-2 to report independently of state control .
This evening , police withdrew from <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the streets of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF></COREF> .
Outside <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the Federal Parliament building</COREF> , <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">hundreds of thousands</COREF> gathered for a rally .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Vojislav Kostunica</COREF> appealed to <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to stay on the streets and defend democracy .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Kostunica</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> took <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> into several wars and now wanted *PRO*-1 to wage a battle against <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own people .
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">The crowd</COREF> chanted `` arrest <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Slobo</COREF> and *PRO* let <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> march onto Beveneary 3rd , to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic 's</COREF> residence .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Kostunica</COREF> advised calm .
What <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't say *T*-1 was what <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could n't *?* *T*-2 , which *T*-3 is where exactly <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Slobodan Milosevic</COREF> is *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has n't been seen *-1 or heard from *-1 in the past 24 hours .
For <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The World</COREF> , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is Nenad Chebeck in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF> .
