Neither candidate will be declared *-1 *PRO*-2 the President - elect until <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">at least Friday</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's when the overseas ballots will be counted *-1 and factored *-1 into the candidates ' final totals *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The World 's</COREF> Jennifer Glass</COREF> reports from <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> .
There are Floridians all over <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> .
Because abroad are n't counted *-1 in our census , no one knows how many , and no one knows how many *T*-2 voted .
Those who *T*-1 did it like <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Margaret Sawn</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an American working in Costa Rica</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-3 says 0 <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is glad *ICH*-2 a week and a half before Americans in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> went to the polls that <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> cast <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> absentee ballot for George Bush .
Well , because , you know , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> was going after the outer voters very hard , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did feel 0 Friday would be important , and , of course <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't think , 0 it would get down to this but who would n't *T*-1 *?* .
Here in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Frances Deek</COREF> is a retired teacher who *T*-1 lived in Britain for 18 years .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> cast <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> absentee ballot for <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF> .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Deek</COREF> says 0 in recent days , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> has had *-1 to defend <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the United States 's</COREF> political system .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Britains who *T*-1 notice 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is American</COREF> , have let <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> know what <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think *T*-2 of <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the elections</COREF> .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> keep *-1 saying , " Oh , is n't that terrible .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">The biggest democracy in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF></COREF> and <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's all falling apart .
And <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> say 0 it is because <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are a democracy that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's happening this way *T*-1 .
It 's because everybody gets the vote .
It 's because <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> will not let things slide .
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to know everything .
This is part of *PRO* being a democracy .
But for Americans abroad , says 0 *?* <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Geek</COREF> , participating in democracy <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">voting</COREF> is more work then for Americans in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> .
You have *-1 to make a very conscious effort and it *EXP*-3 takes *PRO* mailing two things *PRO* to get *PRO*-2 to vote .
You have *-1 to send in your card *PRO* to start with , and then when you get the ballot bag *T*-2 , you have *-3 to send the ballot back .
So , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's harder than if you were just wandered up to your poll on Election Day and voted because you have been registered for years .
In the Israeli town of Ramad Beithshamuz , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Karen London originally from Hollywood , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF></COREF> , says 0 <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> and <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband</COREF></COREF> almost did n't vote .
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> ballot arrived late .
<COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> husband</COREF> said 0 voting was a waste of time , but <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> insisted and mailed <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ballots .
Now <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is glad 0 <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did n't listen to <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband</COREF> and so is *T*-1 <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> .
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't think anything of it and so when <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> grandson called Wednesday morning *PRO*-1 to say , ' *PRO* Wake up , today <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> vote</COREF> is going *-2 to count ' *T*-3 , then it was really a matter of , you know , <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> vote</COREF> not only does <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> count like <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> shows in any election , but <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> really counts in the final and <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> voted an absentee ballot .
But <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Londons</COREF> did n't say which way <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> voted *T*-1 but <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have cast ballots in each of the three Presidential elections held * since <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> moved to Israel 9 years ago .
This year , says *?* <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Karen</COREF> , has been special and a little frightening .
It *EXP*-1 's quite a daunting feeling to think that , you know , of hundreds and millions of people , you know , in this case <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> vote</COREF> counts , although <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't count more than any other citizen 's vote , in this particular moment <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> counts more than everybody else 's , because <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's what they are waiting for *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Major Mikiang</COREF> , <COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Floridian based * in Germany</COREF></COREF> is from Okichobee County , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> .
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 despite the waiting , the court cases and the uncertainty , <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is not worried that there 'll be a constitutional crisis in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> .
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't really have any concerns at all .
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am very confident that <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> form of government that *T*-4 checks and balances the way 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> set <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">the process</COREF> up *T*-1 and the way 0 <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is moving *T*-2 , so many things 0 *PRO* to fall back on *T*-3 *PRO* to keep <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">the process</COREF> moving , that <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am not really concerned at all .
One radio announcer here in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> made an accurate and insightful comment today .
At a time like this with the Presidency hanging in the balance , in many nations the generals have moved in .
In <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> the lawyers do .
For <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the World</COREF> , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am Jennifer Glass in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> .
