In what *T*-1 may have been a ripple effect of the <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">Middle East</COREF> crisis , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">an explosion</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> killed at least four sailors on <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">a US Navy destroyer</COREF> in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the Yemeni port of Aden</COREF> .
American investigators are going to <COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.0851.mrg-E5" TYPE="IDENT">the scene</COREF> but in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> at the White House , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon</COREF> and the State Department , US officials are already expressing suspicions that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">today 's</COREF> explosion</COREF> was an act of terrorism .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT">The World 's</COREF> Clark Boyd</COREF> reports .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The blast , which *T*-1 occurred just after noon local time in <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF></COREF> , ripped a 20 x 40 foot gash in <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.0851.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the USS Cole</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.0851.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a state - of - the - art destroyer that *T*-2 had stopped in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Aden</COREF> *PRO*-3 to refuel before *PRO*-3 joining the carrier George Washington in the Persian Gulf</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Speaking at <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Cole 's</COREF> home base in Norfolk , Virginia , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Admiral John Foley</COREF> said that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy</COREF> is investigating <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the incident</COREF> .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know whether <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was terrorism or not .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was an act of certainly a severe belligerence but <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't know the source , nor can <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> comment any further on that .
But in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Pentagon</COREF> officials</COREF> went further *PRO*-1 saying that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had every reason 0 *PRO*-2 to suspect that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the blast</COREF> was caused *-3 by terrorists *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">The officials</COREF> said that reports from <COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.0851.mrg-E5" TYPE="IDENT">the scene</COREF> , including one from an Army officer working in Aden Harbor , suggested that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">a small rubber craft that *T*-1 was helping <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Cole</COREF> dock</COREF> came alongside <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the destroyer</COREF> and caused <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the blast</COREF> .
Many , including retired Admiral Eugene Carroll , are suspicious that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the small boat</COREF> may have been loaded *-1 with high - power explosives and that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the attack</COREF> was planned *-2 .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">That craft that *T*-1 approached <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Cole</COREF></COREF> is a rubber boat , not a big craft , but <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would have had *-2 to <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">pack</COREF> <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> fully with explosives *PRO*-3 to do the amount of damage that <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did *T*-4 to <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Cole</COREF> and <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">that *ICH*-5</COREF> certainly would have taken time *PRO* to get that put *-6 together .
While both <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon</COREF> and the Justice Department <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> dispatched teams of experts to <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> *PRO*-1 to investigate <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the explosion</COREF> , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Secretary of State Madeleine Albright</COREF> urged caution *PRO*-2 saying 0 it was too early *PRO* to jump to any conclusions .
Still , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> promised that <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> would <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">take</COREF> appropriate action if terrorists were found *-1 to be behind <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the blast</COREF> , <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">a sentiment echoed * later in the day by President Clinton</COREF> .
If , as it now appears , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was an act of terrorism , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was a despicable and cowardly act .
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> will find out who *T*-1 is responsible and hold <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> accountable .
If <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> intention was *PRO* to deter <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> from <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> mission of *PRO* promoting peace and security in <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF> , <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will fail utterly .
For some terrorism experts <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">today 's</COREF> attack , which *T*-1 occurred against the backdrop of intense clashes between Palestinians and Israelis in <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF></COREF> , has an eerily familiar ring to it .
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Bruce Hoffman</COREF> is the director of the Rand Corporation 's <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> office .
We have seen often in the past how violence and conflict and tensions in <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF> often embroil <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> *T*-1 .
One only has *-1 to recall the bombing of the US Marine barracks in <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Lebanon</COREF> in 1983 , also a month before presidential election , also at a time when <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> was involving suitable ferment at that point in <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Lebanon</COREF> now with the Palestinians *T*-2 , where <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> was also attempting actively *PRO*-5 to provide some stabilizing influence and unfortunately and tragically got caught up in the maelstrom *T*-6 and that seems *PRO* to be the salient fact of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this attack</COREF> .
And if <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this attack</COREF> turns out *-1 to be the work of terrorists , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Hoffman</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would signal a dangerous new trend .
Maritime or marine - borne terrorist attacks <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> actually quite rare .
<COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> being said *-1 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could well be the beginning of a new pattern .
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have made it far more difficult , appropriately so , for terrorists to attack <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> ground forces in the Arabian Peninsula .
So , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">terrorists prevented * from *PRO*-1 attacking <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> targets *PRO*-2 using <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> more conventional means ` truck bombs '</COREF> have merely <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">adjusted</COREF> <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> tactics slightly and obviously <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have been successful with <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .
On Yemeni TV <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> President</COREF> expressed <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> heart - felt condolences to those who *T*-1 were killed and injured *-2 , but denied that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the explosion on board <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the cole</COREF></COREF> was caused *-3 by terrorists , although , admits 0 *?* <COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.0851.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mohammed Al - Qadhi</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.0851.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">editor of the Yemen Observer newspaper in <COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.0851.mrg-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the capital</COREF> <COREF ID="PRI20001012.2000.0851.mrg-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sana</COREF></COREF> , anti-American sentiment has been running high in <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF> because of events in <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF> .
<COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">The people now in the streets</COREF> are gathering because <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> feel that not just as Arabs , as human beings , that what *T*-1 is happening in Palestine is not humanitarian .
*PRO* Regarding <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the United States '</COREF> attitude in this regard , we find that <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> until now are supporting <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> .
The people here feel that <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">United States</COREF> should do something .
With tensions running high throughout <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">today 's</COREF> incident off the coast of <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Yemen</COREF></COREF> serves as a warning .
US armed forces and diplomatic personnel might be on high alert for sometime 0 *T*-1 to come .
For <COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT">The World</COREF> <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is Clark Boyd .
