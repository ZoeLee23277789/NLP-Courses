This is <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the World</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am Lisa Mullins .
Well <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> ca n't tell you who *T*-1 won Florida , but in a moment <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will enter the musical question , who *T*-2 let the dogs out ?
First up <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the answer to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> geo quiz today</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are looking for <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">a region of central Italy bordering the Adriatic Sea</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">The area</COREF> is mostly mountainous and includes <COREF ID="23" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mt. Corno</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the highest peak of the Apennines</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also includes <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a lot of sheep</COREF> , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">good clean - living , healthy sheep</COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">an Italian entrepreneur</COREF> has an idea about how *PRO* to make a little money of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">The answer</COREF> is Abruzzo .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Journalist Carlos Depalazai</COREF> was in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Rome , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Italy</COREF></COREF> and <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Carlo</COREF> how does <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">this fellow</COREF> plan *PRO*-1 to profit from <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the sheep of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the Abruzzo</COREF></COREF> *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is taking advantage of two crazes that we are having *T*-1 in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Italy</COREF> at the moment , one is internet , the other one is the awareness on food .
So <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">this guy</COREF> came up with the idea of *PRO* having people adopting sheep by an internet .
So you can have access through your computer on your desk .
*PRO* Go to <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the web site of these guys</COREF> and you can have look at the face of sheep which *T*-1 are available *-2 to be adopted *-3 .
So what does it *EXP*-2 mean *T*-1 *PRO* to adopt <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">a sheep</COREF> , *PRO* to show up on your back step or do you , somehow keep track of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> progress on <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the farm in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Italy</COREF></COREF> ?
You are not actually adopting <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the sheep</COREF> in the sense that you can have <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with you .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> looks like distant adoption , where you do n't actually have the child in your home *T*-1 .
You are just contributing with a certain amount of money and you are monitoring the growing up .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> works in the same way , so you have access on <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the web site of <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">this little farm , in a little village of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Abrutzi</COREF></COREF></COREF> and you can choose among many , many sheeps and after *PRO* contributing with <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">a certain amount of money</COREF> the sheep is actually yours .
All right , so <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the amount of money 0 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have mentioned *T*-1 to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF></COREF> is about 160 US dollars and for <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> you get more than just a warm and fuzzy feeling .
You can also receive leggings that *T*-1 are made *-2 from wool of the sheep and even if you like some of the sheep dropping delivered * to your door .
Yeah , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean this is quite funny , but I think apart from all the details , which *T*-1 are sometimes even strange <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 what *T*-2 is really important is that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a sign of a new concern that *T*-3 is effecting <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Italian people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are notoriously lover of good food .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have a generous attitude towards food , and <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a new stuff .
The fact that you really care about <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">a sheep</COREF> in the way 0 <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is fed *-1 *T*-2 , in the way 0 <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is nurtured *-3 *T*-4 , in the way 0 people are looking after <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-5 , because it 's a way 0 *PRO* to ensure that you have something which *T*-6 is genuine on your table up the end *T*-7 .
*PRO* Wait a minute , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> said that on your table at the end .
Yeah , at the table if <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> becomes food for instance , which *T*-1 is <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">an option</COREF> .
You are adopting <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the sheep</COREF> and whatever *T*-1 happens at the end it 's your choice and among the option <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> *T*-2 you know food for your meal .
<COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> kind of puts a whole new tone to <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">this thing</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean usually when you think of <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">this kind of adoption</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> means *PRO* saving <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">an animal</COREF> not eventually eating <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> an option which *T*-1 is available and <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a sort of provocation .
You know <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">Italians</COREF> now mainly live in metropolitan areas in big cities like <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Rome</COREF> , Florence , Naples .
In the past , <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were a population of shepherds or farmers .
<COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> had completely different attitude towards nature .
It seems that <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are losing something , and <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need *-1 to reestablish a better relationship with nature and the simple fact that <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">the Environment Minister in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Italy</COREF></COREF> supported the initiative and <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">he <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> adopted a sheep is significant .
<COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> took advantage *ICH*-1 immediately of these ideas *PRO*-2 to build up a new awareness and a new attitude of <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">Italians</COREF> towards nature and farms .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="260" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Carlo De Blazia</COREF> , <COREF ID="260" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">journalist</COREF> speaking to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> from <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Rome</COREF> .</COREF>
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> very much <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Carlo</COREF> .
Nice *PRO* to talk to <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
