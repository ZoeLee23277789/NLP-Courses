<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">American businessman Edmund Pope</COREF> <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> formally <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">asked</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Russian President Vladimir Putin</COREF> for a pardon .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Pope</COREF> was sentenced *-1 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> to 20 years hard labor after a <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Moscow</COREF> court found <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> guilty of spying .
Prosecutors said 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Pope</COREF> had illegally obtained classified blueprints for a new Russian high - speed torpedo .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Pope , whose company *T*-1 analyzes foreign maritime equipment</COREF> , has maintained <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> innocence .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is the first American citizen 0 *T*-1 to be jailed *-2 for espionage since the end of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the Cold War</COREF> .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The World 's</COREF> Nenad Chebeck</COREF> is in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Moscow</COREF> .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Nenad</COREF> , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Pope</COREF> was sentenced *-1 despite an appeal for clemency by <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF> .
Why has <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> taken <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">this legal option</COREF> *T*-1 ?
Does <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> have no confidence in the courts ?
Well , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say 0 it *EXP*-1 is pretty clear that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has no confidence in the Russian judicial system .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did have an option of *PRO*-1 appealing to the Russian Supreme Court but frankly <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a more likely *RNR*-2 and a faster *RNR*-2 way to freedom , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say 0 *?* , because *PRO* going through the appeals process is going *-3 to take months .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is known *-1 to be of ill health .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> definitely wants *PRO*-1 to get out of the Lefortovo Prison and it *EXP*-2 would appear by the latest signs that <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is going *-3 to be the right way .
*PRO* Going through an appeals court would take a lot of time and the outcome would be highly uncertain .
So <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Nenad</COREF> , what 's the timetable here *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">The request</COREF> went to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> in turn passes <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> on *RNR*-1 or has passed <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> on *RNR*-1 to <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the Presidential Pardons Commission</COREF> .
Is that correct ?
Yes , it has all happened actually very , very quickly .
After the court cases dragged on for a couple of months and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Pope</COREF> has been in jail since April the 3rd , the ball really started *-1 rolling <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> wrote to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Putin 's</COREF> office announced that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> has passed on <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> to <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the Presidential Pardons Commission</COREF> and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> already we had <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the head of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the commission</COREF></COREF> appearing on Russian state television and saying that <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will recommend a pardon to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">President Vladimir Putin</COREF> .
Now <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">this commission</COREF> is due *PRO*-1 to meet tomorrow but it *EXP*-2 is very difficult *PRO* to envisage <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the commission</COREF> not doing what <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the head of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the commission</COREF></COREF> has said 0 <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will do *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">The Presidential Pardons Commission in <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF></COREF> , is <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> a relatively new institution ?
<COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would assume <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> being the first <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Cold War</COREF> spy case in 40 years in <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF> that a certain number of institutions that *T*-1 are being involved *-2 , perhaps are being involved *-3 for the first time .
Well , there are really no precedents here <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">Tony</COREF> because , as <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> mentioned *?* , the last trial of an alleged foreign spy , was actually the trial of <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Gary Powers</COREF> way back in 1961 , and <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Gary Powers</COREF> was shot *-1 down over <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF> , so <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> guilt was fairly firmly established *-2 and ever since then <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">any suspected spies</COREF> were usually either sort of simply kicked *-3 out of <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> , expelled *-3 , or <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were arrested *-4 and then swapped *-4 for Russian spies arrested * in Western countries .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">The speed with which <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Putin</COREF> seems *-1 to have responded to events here *T*-2</COREF> , is <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> any indication that perhaps <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has found <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the whole incident</COREF> embarrassing ?
It may be that <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is simply a case which *T*-1 is not important on a wider scale for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Putin</COREF> , that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">shown</COREF> what <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needed *-2 to show *T*-3 to the Russian public , which *T*-4 is that <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">the system</COREF> is there , <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">the system</COREF> is going strong , <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is taking care of the state secrets and , you know , <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">the police</COREF> is doing <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> job , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">the Federal Security Service</COREF> is doing <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> job , but now that <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> has been done with *-5 , now that we have had a conviction in court <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does not see the necessity of *PRO* pursuing <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the whole thing</COREF> any further , and in order *PRO* to appear *-9 magnanimous in the eyes of the Western public opinion , certainly , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess that those are the reasons which *T*-6 prompted <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-7 to move in the direction 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has moved *T*-8 .
And one would assume that the effort *ICH*-1 is also being made *-4 *PRO* to make *PRO* *EXP*-2 sure that US - Russian relations are n't seriously affected *-3 by <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> ?
Yes , because there have been a number of calls in the American Congress , for example , *PRO* to introduce economic sanctions against <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF> for <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> .
<COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">The administration <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> has not shown any willingness *PRO*-1 to get involved *-2 too deeply and certainly has not shown any willingness *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">introduce</COREF> sanctions against <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF> , but we do know that <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">President Clinton</COREF> has spoken to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Vladimir Putin</COREF> about <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> .
We do know that <COREF ID="249" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Secretary of State</COREF> <COREF ID="249" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Madeleine Albright</COREF> has raised <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> a number of times , so this will certainly help *PRO* smooth the way towards the future of American administration , as and when there is one *T*-1 .

Thanks again , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Nenad</COREF> .
<COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are welcome , <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">Tony</COREF> .
