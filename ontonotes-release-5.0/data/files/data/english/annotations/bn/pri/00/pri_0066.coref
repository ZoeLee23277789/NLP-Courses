*PRO* Documented *-1 .
From <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">NPR News in Washington</COREF> , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm Corey Flintoff .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">A <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> state judge</COREF> has ordered local election officials *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">ship</COREF> <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">thousands of ballots</COREF> to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the state capital</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The move</COREF> comes as <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> decides whether *PRO*-1 to order a recount of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">those ballots in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the presidential election</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">NPR 's</COREF> Steve Inski</COREF> was in the courtroom .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Steve</COREF> , what are the issues that *T*-2 came up in this hearing tonight *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Corey</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Judge N. Sander Sauls</COREF> is deciding whether *PRO*-1 to order a recount *ICH*-2 as <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> said *?* of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20001128.2000.0055.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">those ballots</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20001128.2000.0055.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">9000 or more actually from Miami Dade County that *T*-3 apparently were never counted *-4 at all , at least according to the Democrats in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the presidential election</COREF> and about 3300 ballots from Palm Beach County that *T*-5 were considered *-6 by local officials but then thrown *-6 out , disallowed *-6</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Judge Sauls</COREF> is deciding whether *PRO* to count <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">those ballots</COREF> and go through <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and perhaps add some votes to Al Gore 's final total , which *T*-1 is exactly what the Democrats want *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is not ready *PRO*-1 to do that yet .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did not agree to the Democratic proposal *PRO* to begin *-1 counting tomorrow morning but <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has ordered that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the ballots</COREF> be shipped *-2 up .
Later this week , Miami Police apparently are going *-1 to escort <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> up to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Tallahassee</COREF> and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will be ready *PRO*-2 to be counted *-3 if <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> decides at a later time *PRO* to do so .
Now time is a big consideration from here .
What 's <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the judge 's</COREF> timetable</COREF> *T*-1 ?
Not as fast as the Democrats would like , not as slowly as Republicans would prefer .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is going *-1 to order <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">a major hearing on Saturday *PRO*-3 to review all the legal and evidentiary issues , look at evidence , perhaps hear from witnesses</COREF> and after <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> will decide if there are any ballots 0 *PRO* to <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">count</COREF> *T*-2 .
It *EXP*-1 might take another five days or so *PRO* to do <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Neither side seemed *-2 particularly pleased by <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the timetable</COREF> but <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> said , well , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am going *-1 to make everybody equally unhappy .
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .

As the battle over votes goes on in <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Washington State</COREF> is in the middle of *PRO* <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">recounting</COREF> <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the votes cast * in <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> very tight US Senate race</COREF> .
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Jennifer Nesan</COREF> reports from member station KPLU in <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Seattle</COREF> .
<COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">The recount of <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the votes cast * for <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Democrat Maria Catwell</COREF> and <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Republican senator Slate Gordon</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> is calm and organized .

There are <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">a lot of things about the election 's process <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that *T*-1 are fairly complex</COREF> .
<COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is n't probably one of <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Catwell</COREF> leads <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Republican incumbent Slate Gordon</COREF> by fewer than 2000 votes .
At this point neither of <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the candidates</COREF> plan *PRO*-1 to contest any of <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the votes</COREF> .
State law requires a recount when the margin of victory is less than one half of 1 percent *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">The recount</COREF> is expected *-1 to be completed *-2 by the end of the week .
No statewide recount in <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> has ever changed the initial outcome .
For <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">NPR News</COREF> , <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm Jennifer Nesan in <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Seattle</COREF> .
