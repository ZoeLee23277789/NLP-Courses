From BBC News in London , I am Gregor Cragy for <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">The World</COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">The US Supreme Court</COREF> has held a hearing *PRO*-1 to decide whether *PRO* to intervene in the dispute over the presidential election results .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Judith Spencer</COREF> reports on the legal wrangling that *T*-1 is underway .
Inside the stately <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> building , lawyers for <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Republican George W. Bush</COREF> and <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Democrat Al Gore</COREF> argued over the validity of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">hand re-counts in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the crucial state of Florida</COREF></COREF> , just as Ruth Bater Ginsburg pressed <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Bush 's</COREF> lawyer *PRO*-1 to explain why <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Federal High Court</COREF> should intervene in <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Florida Supreme Court 's</COREF> move *PRO* to extend the deadline for *PRO* finishing <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the re-counts</COREF> *T*-2 .
When <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> read <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">a state court decision</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> should read <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in the light most favorable to the integrity of the State Supreme Court .
But later on , Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the state court</COREF> might have been out of line .
The legislature had very clearly said , you know , 7 days after , that 's the date and it just does look like very dramatic change made * by <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> court</COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">The US Supreme Court</COREF> could rule on the matter as early as tomorrow .
For <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">The World</COREF> , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am Judith Spencer in Washington .
Meanwhile , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Florida Supreme Court</COREF> has rejected an emergency appeal from <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF> for an immediate re-count of thousands of disputed ballots from Palm Beach and Miami Dade counties .
