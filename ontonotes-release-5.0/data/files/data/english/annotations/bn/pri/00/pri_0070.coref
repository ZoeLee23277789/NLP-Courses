<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is The World .
I am Lisa Mullins .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Both <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">George W. Bush</COREF> and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> continue *-1 to press <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cases literally and figuratively .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> PR machines seem *-1 to be functioning smoothly .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Governor Bush 's</COREF> running mate</COREF> <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Dick Cheney</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">talked</COREF> with reporters about <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican transition plans</COREF> , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">another signal that <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> is getting ready *PRO*-1 to become <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the next President of the United States</COREF></COREF> .
Meanwhile , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Vice President Gore</COREF> continued <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> appeal for patience while <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> contests <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Bush 's</COREF> claim to victory , and attorneys for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">both men</COREF> were preparing for key court battles later in the week , which *T*-1 could settle the three - week dispute over who *T*-3 won <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> and the presidency .
<COREF ID="266" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The World 's</COREF> Clark Boyd</COREF> has the latest .
All eyes were on <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> yet again <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> as <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">lawyers , judges , lawmakers and citizens</COREF> , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">all</COREF> picked at the knots that *T*-1 have tied up the conclusion of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">this presidential election</COREF> for the past three weeks .
Yesterday in <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Leon County Circuit Court</COREF> , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Judge N. Sander Sauls</COREF> set a <COREF ID="253" TYPE="IDENT">Saturday</COREF> deadline for a hearing on vote recounts and ordered <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the roughly 14000 contested ballots in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Miami Dade and <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Palm Beach</COREF> counties</COREF></COREF> , not to mention a sample voting machine and voting booth , to be brought *-1 to <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Tallahassee</COREF> under police escort .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , as officials in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">both two counties</COREF> ready <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the ballots</COREF> for transport , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">George W. Bush 's</COREF> lawyers asked <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">order</COREF> all 1.16 million ballots from <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the two counties</COREF> to be trucked *-2 to <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the state capital</COREF> .
Late this afternoon , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Judge Sauls</COREF> granted <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">that motion</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Vice President Al Gore</COREF> was back on television this morning *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to shore up public support for <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> legal cause .
In a taped interview , for NBC 's Today Show , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> said 0 despite all the legal maneuvering <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is calling on <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">both camps</COREF> *PRO*-1 to put partisan politics aside .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">both <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Governor Bush</COREF> and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF></COREF> should recognize an obligation *ICH*-4 during this time when the votes are *-1 still to be counted *-2 *T*-3 , *PRO* to try *PRO*-5 to restrain the passions of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> partisan supporters .
Meanwhile , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="115" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Bush 's</COREF> vice presidential candidate</COREF> <COREF ID="115" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Dick Cheney</COREF></COREF> was a busy man <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .
After a heart checkup at a <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> hospital <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> appeared at a news conference *PRO*-1 to say that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is pressing ahead with <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">transition plans</COREF> .
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have now acquired <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">office space in McClain , Virginia that *T*-1 will become the site for the transition operation that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> announced *T*-2 two days ago</COREF> , so <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are just in a business of *PRO* getting up and *PRO* running , but <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> now have <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">an office with a lot of space</COREF> .
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have got people signing up , volunteers coming on , telephones *ICH*-2 being put *-1 in and computers , so <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will be fully operational within the next day or two .
Earlier today in <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> , <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican dominated legislature</COREF> began hearings on *PRO* calling a special session *PRO* to <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">pick</COREF> <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> electors</COREF> <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> , should the December 12th deadline still find <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> tied * up in the courts .
<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">The committee</COREF> heard from angry voters and precinct workers in <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Palm Beach</COREF> .
<COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe 0 our issues do relate directly to <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the appointing of <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">electors for <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the state of Florida</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">The electors</COREF> need *-1 to be appointed *-2 *RNR*-4 , are supposed *-1 to be appointed *-3 *RNR*-4 according to <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">the will of the people</COREF> and <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe in <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Palm Beach County</COREF> that it *EXP*-5 was very difficult *PRO* to determine what <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">the will of the people</COREF> was *T*-6 *T*-7 .
Although <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Al Gore</COREF> said <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> certainly feels like <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> won <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> put <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> odds of *PRO* wining the various legal battles at fifty - fifty .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> said , 0 if <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> does triumph in court , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will throw <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> support behind <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican President - elect</COREF> .
But for now , says 0 *?* <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">former Clinton administration cabinet member Robert Riche</COREF> , <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">both sides</COREF> are positive that <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've won <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> , and says 0 *?* <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">Riche</COREF> , the longer <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">the fight</COREF> goes on , the more troublesome the next four years might be *?* .
What <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> risk *T*-1 by *PRO* prolonging <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is greater public cynicism and a hardening of partisan lines among career politicians who *T*-2 have *-3 to work together .
After all , come January , these people are going *-1 to have *-2 to be in <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> whether <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> or <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> is <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> .
You have a lot of politicians in Congress who *T*-1 are going *-2 to have *-3 to work together with <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the new President</COREF> and with each other , so <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-4 to prolong <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> forever .
The US Supreme Court will hear arguments from <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">both sides</COREF> on Friday and <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's</COREF> Leon County Circuit Court</COREF> will consider the arguments on <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">disputed state ballots</COREF> on <COREF ID="253" TYPE="IDENT">Saturday</COREF> , and while the nation wearies of the protracted legal battle maybe <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Leon County Circuit Court</COREF> judge N. Sander Sauls</COREF> said it best .
The whole process , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *?* , is a bit like *PRO* being nibbled *-1 to death by a duck .
For <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The World</COREF> , <COREF ID="266" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is Clark Boyd .
