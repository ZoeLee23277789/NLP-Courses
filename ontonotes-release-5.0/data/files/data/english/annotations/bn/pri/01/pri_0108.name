<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The Gulf War</ENAMEX> began <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</ENAMEX> and ended <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">6 weeks</ENAMEX> later with a decisive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> victory over <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , but little has changed since then .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> nations are still bitter enemies .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The United States</ENAMEX> continues to insist that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> sanctions remain against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> until <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> completely dismantles its programs of weapons of mass destruction .
The only exception to the trade embargo is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the UN Oil for Food Program</ENAMEX> , which President <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Saddam Hussein</ENAMEX> grudgingly accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">5 years ago</ENAMEX> .
That program has helped provide <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> with basic foods and stabilize the economy somewhat , but <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> complains that the program is inadequate .
Under it <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> has sold <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">40 billion dollars</ENAMEX> worth of oil and has received only <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10 billion dollars</ENAMEX> worth of goods .
The rest of the money , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">30 billion dollars</ENAMEX> , has gone to pay war reparations , assist the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Kurds</ENAMEX> in northern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and pay for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN</ENAMEX> operation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's Oil Minister , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Omar Mohammed Rashid</ENAMEX> called for an end to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Oil for Food Program</ENAMEX> .
You can not run a country with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">23 million</ENAMEX> people with revenues of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">16 billion</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">20 billion dollars</ENAMEX> .
You run it from a security council .
This is totally impossible , even with all the good faith .
So just imagine with all the bad faith .
We know there is absolutely no hope for this program to succeed .
There were other signs today that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's leaders have few regrets over the action that precipitated <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Gulf War</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> 's Deputy Prime Minister defended the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> invasion of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> and claimed that his country was the victim of a conspiracy , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam Hussein 's</ENAMEX> eldest son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uday</ENAMEX> , who is a member of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Parliament</ENAMEX> , proposed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> should be included in a new map of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
