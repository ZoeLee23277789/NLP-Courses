This is <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The World</ENAMEX> .
I am <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Kahn</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gao Xingjian</ENAMEX> arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> and when he leaves the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> born writer will have something extra in his suitcase , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">the Nobel Prize for Literature</ENAMEX> .
Today <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gao</ENAMEX> , who now lives in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , gave the traditional <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Nobel</ENAMEX> lecture as part of the festivities leading up to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</ENAMEX> 's ceremony , and on the same day he collects the prize .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gao</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> novel <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">` Soul Mountain '</ENAMEX> will be published for the first time in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
If you want to know what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gao Xingjian</ENAMEX> is all about , as a thinker and as an artist , our international book critic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Meryl</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gao</ENAMEX> 's masterpiece is an ideal starting point .
His politics are embedded in his writing and his writing is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> and foremost a celebration of freedom .
This novel <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">` soul mountain '</ENAMEX> , which is just being released in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> is in every possible way a celebration of what freedom means .
It 's a large novel , full of all kinds of ideas and incidents and stories and tales and a polyphony of voices .
It is , if you like , the whole world wrapped up in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> pages .
It is the world at its most carnival - like , and yet it is virtually impossible , is n't it , for a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> artist to do something or to make a statement without its having some kind of either political effect or be political in origin .
I mean this man took the trip on which the novel was based for political reasons , did he not ?
Certainly .
He is born in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1940</ENAMEX> .
He is a product of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> .
In fact he had to burn up an entire suitcase full of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of poems and plays and stories at the start of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Cultural Revolution</ENAMEX> in fear of going to prison , and then in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</ENAMEX> after being diagnosed with lung cancer , which had killed his father <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years earlier</ENAMEX> and being convinced that he himself was going to die , he gets a kind of reprieve .
He gets a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> chest X-ray , discovers that he does n't have lung cancer , recognizes that by virtue of the kinds of things that he is writing , his openness to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Western</ENAMEX> literary ideas , that he is in political trouble again , and so he sets out on an extraordinary odyssey of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 15,000 kilometers</ENAMEX> , mostly on foot , which he takes through southwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
He had survived , if you will , a death sentence , and now in that new freedom of the life in front of him , he takes to the road in the tradition of old <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> poets and records what he sees , what he hears , the stories that he is told .
The book is filled with marvelous descriptions of the gorges through which he walks , the mountains that he climbs , indeed the book is called <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Soul Mountain</ENAMEX> , the mountain on which he hopes in some way or another to get in touch with his soul , his individual soul , as opposed to that mass kind of soul being enforced upon him by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> authorities , the social realism that the cadres would have him write in .
Not only can this fellow write , he can paint too , ca n't he ?
He is best known among his neighbors in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> as a painter .
He has had more than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - man shows and his paintings are quite delicately done and there he is also very well known as a playwright .
I think he has published <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 18</ENAMEX> plays now and he writes his plays in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">French</ENAMEX> .
Just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> last thing quoting him and I wonder if you could respond to this , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> , he said at the very beginning of his wonderful speech to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Nobel Prize Committee</ENAMEX> , he said , `` I do not wish to waste this talk on literature by saying too much about politics and history , What I want to do is to use this opportunity to speak as one writer in the voice of an individual . ''
Is that true basically not only for him <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day , today</ENAMEX> , but of all of his work ?
Well , the work that we have so far in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> translation suggests that , and indeed this novel , which is a celebration as well of the self of the individual , goes so far as to even divide up to the self .
Characters proliferate out of the imagination of the narrator so that you have at a certain point , you have a new he , you have a new she , you have a you , and each one of these characters tells stories , each story of which is designed to give you a deeper sense of the richness and the complexity of life in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher Meryl</ENAMEX> is Director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Writing Program</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Iowa</ENAMEX> and our international book citric .
Thanks , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Christopher</ENAMEX> .
Thank you .
