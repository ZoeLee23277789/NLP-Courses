With this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">month</ENAMEX> 's ouster of strongman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> is rapidly joining the international community .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , the country was admitted into an international <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Balkan</ENAMEX> development program .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> now hopes to join <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the International Monetary Fund</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World Bank</ENAMEX> .
At home , President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Kostunica</ENAMEX> says that he intends to promote democracy and free speech , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> just might have <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> thoughts , once a theater group that roasted his predecessor over the coals starts turning him on a spit .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">World</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nened Chebeck</ENAMEX> reports from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> capital .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">These days</ENAMEX> at almost every street corner in central <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> , there is a stall selling compact discs with protest songs against the former regime , and the most popular tune blaring out of the speakers goes like this , `` attention , attention , last train for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> via <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> stop <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kosovo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">The Hague</ENAMEX> is departing with a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">ten hour</ENAMEX> delay .
It 's the latest hit by the satirical theater called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Index</ENAMEX> '' .
They started off <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</ENAMEX> in a local radio station and became an enormous success on stage and not just here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> .
They toured the world and performed wherever there is an emigrant community from the former <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yugoslavia</ENAMEX> scattered by the wars here , from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Index</ENAMEX> will be returning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late November</ENAMEX> .
This song is from their latest play , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Last Train for Serbia</ENAMEX> , which was recorded on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> protestors stormed the federal parliament in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> and the main television stations .
The song speaks of panic in the household of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> .
Even before the former President conceded defeat , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Index Theater</ENAMEX> performed live on an improvised stage outside the parliament , in front of a crowd of some <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">300,000</ENAMEX> people .
Actor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drugewbo Unitich</ENAMEX> tells how the show began .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> thing that I told them was please let us close our eyes and just listen .
When they did that and I saw them and I told them in a voice of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> , `` Ladies and gentleman , I am definitely finished . ''
Only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">4 hours</ENAMEX> after that he appeared on television and said something very similar to that .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yubitrich</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> 's most popular actors and he owes it to his skilful portrayal of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> .
Getting into <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> 's shoes even on stage , was quite a temptation says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yubitrich</ENAMEX> .
I always felt when I enter his person , Okay , that I can do whatever I want and I always molested our fellow players you know .
So being <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> is something which I can compare to taking a dangerous drug .
But with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> out of the way , what next for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> 's most popular satirical group ?
Writer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Jonetic</ENAMEX> says he is confident the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> government will provide plenty of fresh material .
We will have plenty of politicians , which we can play .
We will have plenty of idiotic situations in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Serbian</ENAMEX> politics .
Political satirical theater is something which you can apply best to the societies , which are in some kind of crisis .
We are still in crisis and we will be I think for a while , but the current crisis <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonetic</ENAMEX> hopes will at least be <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> where government critics will not be branded as traitors and be banned from public performances .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Index Theater</ENAMEX> is planning a huge comeback now with a series of shows in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> , but even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> is under de facto house arrest in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> , he is very much present on the repertoire of political humors , says his impersonator , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dragewbo Yubitrich</ENAMEX> .
I would like to share <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> joke with the listeners of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> .
It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year of 2004</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Serbia</ENAMEX> it is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">57th</ENAMEX> round of elections from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 2000</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Slobodan Milosevic</ENAMEX> appears on national tv and says , `` I want to greet you as your new President , my name is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Vojislav Kostunica</ENAMEX> '' .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yubitrich</ENAMEX> says , he has already set his sights on the new <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Yugoslav</ENAMEX> President , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kostunica</ENAMEX> and will most likely be impersonating him in the future .
He is not as easy to make fun of yet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yubitritch</ENAMEX> says , unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Milosevic</ENAMEX> , but that does n't mean he will escape the scrutiny and sharp wits of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Index Theater</ENAMEX> .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World</ENAMEX> , this is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nenad Chebeck</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Belgrade</ENAMEX> .
