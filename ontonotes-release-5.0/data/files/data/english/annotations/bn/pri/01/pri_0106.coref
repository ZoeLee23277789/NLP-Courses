This is <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20010112.2000.2018.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The World</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20010112.2000.2018.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a co-production of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the BBC World Service</COREF> , PRI , and WGBH in Boston</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am Lisa Mullins .
A plan *ICH*-2 was <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">announced</COREF> *-1 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> *PRO* to <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">raise</COREF> <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Russian nuclear submarine</COREF> <COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">` Kursk '</COREF></COREF> , next summer , almost a year after <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> hit the bottom of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the Barents Sea</COREF> following a mysterious accident .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20010112.2000.2018.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Kursk Foundation</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20010112.2000.2018.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an international consortium led * by the governments of Russia and The Netherlands</COREF></COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can do <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the job</COREF> safely if <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can secure <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the funding</COREF> .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">The BBC 's</COREF> James Rogers</COREF> was in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Brussels</COREF> for <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">today 's</COREF> announcement</COREF> .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 there are two main reasons for *PRO* raising <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Kursk</COREF> .
Obviously the first one is *PRO* to recover <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the bodies that *T*-1 remain</COREF> .
There are still <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the bodies of more than 100 sailors trapped * in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the vessel</COREF> since <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> sank in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the Barents Sea</COREF> in August of last year</COREF> .
Secondly , there is <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">a longer - term threat</COREF> and <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's an environmental threat .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The Kursk Foundation</COREF> says that <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the nuclear reactors , there are two on <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">board</COREF></COREF> , are safe for the time being but that the corrosive effects of seawater could in time lead to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">radioactive leaks into the ocean , which *T*-1 obviously could have devastating consequences on the fishery and the environment in general</COREF> .
That 's the danger of *PRO* leaving <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> down there .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would think 0 there are risks of *PRO* bringing <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up as well .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a huge submarine .
That 's right .
The size of these things is really very surprising .
In fact one of these Russian nuclear submarines is about the length of one and a half football fields .
Now , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's lying in something over 300 feet of water , so if you can just visualize <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> being turned *-1 on <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> end , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would stick out of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the sea</COREF> about 200 feet .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is a huge submarine and nobody is pretending that <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> , if <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> goes ahead , is going *-1 to be an easy operation .
There are any number of complications , one of which *T*-1 is that as part of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the submarine</COREF> <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> stuck *-2 in sand and clay on <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the seabed</COREF> , so <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's going *-3 to give resistance once <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do try *PRO*-4 to lift <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Second problem , as <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have already mentioned *?* , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">two nuclear reactors on <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">board</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are not going *-1 to be able *PRO*-2 to attach any lifting gear to any parts of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the vessel</COREF> nearby <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the nuclear reactors</COREF> for fear of *PRO* provoking an accident , so <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is going *-3 to be extremely difficult .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> had heard a few months ago about <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">some theories on how <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the submarine</COREF> could be raised *-2 *T*-1</COREF> .
One of <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> was *PRO* <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">using</COREF> balloons .
Is <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> what <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the foundation <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> plans on *PRO*-1 doing *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's not what <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are proposing *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> rescue attempt involves three vessels essentially .
One is a diving ship with two diving bells .
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">The second</COREF> is a huge platform with very large cranes on <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , perhaps a platform of the type more usually used * for oil and gas exploration , and <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">a third vessel involved *</COREF> is what the rescuers describe *T*-1 as a giant offshore barge and <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> is *PRO* to lift <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the submarine</COREF> off <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the seabed</COREF> , attach <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to the underneath of <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">this barge</COREF> and then take <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to the Russian naval port of Mamansk .
How much is <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> going *-1 to cost *T*-2 and where is <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the money</COREF> coming from *T*-3 ?
Well , that 's one of the problems that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are facing *T*-1 so far .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The Kursk Foundation</COREF> <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> were mentioning a figure of <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">70 million dollars</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have already presented <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rescue plans</COREF> to <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">the European Union</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are hoping *PRO*-1 to get some funding from <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , but <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are going *-2 to be looking for worldwide funding because as <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> see it , the potential environmental consequences make this an international problem requiring an international solution .
It *EXP*-1 might be worth *PRO* reiterating that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Kursk</COREF> was such a prestigious submarine and really held a high position in terms of <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian Navy</COREF> , so this is something that <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Russians <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF></COREF> are still dealing with *T*-2 even now .
Very much so because obviously we have read a lot in the last few years about how many parts of the Russian naval fleet *T*-1 is essentially rotting and is poorly maintained *-2 .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">The Kursk</COREF> certainly was n't part of that .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was only launched *-1 in the 1990s and to a great extent was the pride of <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian submarine fleet</COREF> , so it was a great sense of shock when <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> went down *T*-2 .
It was also for men in <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">the Russian Navy</COREF> it *EXP*-1 was a great source of pride *PRO* to serve in <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">the submarine fleet</COREF> , and then of course you have the feelings of the relatives 0 *PRO* to take *T*-2 into account .
There are still <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">more than 100 bodies which *T*-1 have n't been recovered *-2</COREF> , so at least *PRO* raising <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the vessel</COREF> and being able *PRO*-3 to return <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the bodies of <COREF ID="274" TYPE="IDENT">the dead sailors</COREF></COREF> to <COREF ID="275" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="274" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> loved ones</COREF> might go some small way towards *PRO* redressing <COREF ID="275" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> grief .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">The BBC 's</COREF> James Rogers speaking to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> from <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Brussels</COREF> .</COREF>
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> for the update <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">James</COREF> .
Thanks very much .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> pleasure .
