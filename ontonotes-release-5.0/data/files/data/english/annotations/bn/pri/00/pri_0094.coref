Not a whole lot happens in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Dornoch</COREF> , but <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">tomorrow</COREF> <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the small Scottish town</COREF> will <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> the center of the universe .
At least <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's the conclusion 0 you might reach *T*-1 from *PRO* seeing <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the hundreds of journalists and photographers camped out there</COREF> .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are all vying for <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the story of the millennium , which *T*-1 is , as if you did n't know , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">tomorrow 's</COREF> wedding of <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">singer Madonna</COREF> and <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">filmmaker Guy Ritchie</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">This amazing , thrilling and fantastic story</COREF> began today with the christening of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the couple 's</COREF> four - month old boy</COREF> ' <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rocco</COREF> . '
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Reporter Garith McClain</COREF> is covering <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the story</COREF> for <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the London based Guardian newspaper</COREF> .
Now <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Garith</COREF> it sounds like the Scottish media have all gone mad .
Why this interest in <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">an American pop star</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are surprised that <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have such an American pop star in <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Scotland <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> , never mind up in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Dornoch which *T*-1 is near <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Inverness , which *T*-2 is the back of beyond even to most Scottish people</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> like the wilds of Washington State .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's the best comparison 0 <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can make *T*-1 .
So <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are saying 0 there are n't Hollywood stars and starlets there , there is not a whole lot going on .
Just the howling wind and the pouring rain otherwise .
And a lot of fog <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess now .
Apparently , it *EXP*-2 's going *-1 to be hard *PRO* to get a good camera angle for <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the wedding</COREF> .
Apparently so , yes , and <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the guests</COREF> have been warned *-1 *PRO*-2 not to keep cameras in <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> kilts</COREF> .
Cameras in <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> kilts</COREF> ?
Yes .
If one would so desire .
Well apparently , photo lens in your pocket or are you just pleased *PRO* to see me .
Yes , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">guests</COREF> have been warned *-1 *PRO*-2 not to bring in cameras in <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> kilts and <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> are having <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> kilts examined *-4 and looked up *-4 , which if you know anything about <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Scotland</COREF> and <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Scottish men</COREF> are n't suppose *-3 to wear anything under <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> kilts .
Yeah .
A bit of an eyeful .
Yes , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can *?* .
He 's got a camera there !
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's an interesting little anecdote , is n't <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *?* ?
Well , when this sort of thing happens in a small community *T*-1 and <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess 0 that 's a under statement in this case , whether or not it all succeeds depends on how well some of the local people can keep secrets *T*-2 .
Are people kind of , you know , in the fold on this , or are there things being leaked * around to press here and there ?
Well Skibo Castle , where <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the wedding</COREF> is being held *-2 *T*-1 , is very discrete .
There have been a lot of celebrity weddings there but none as big as <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> admittedly .
But within <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the town</COREF> there was <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">a piano being rented * out from <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">a piano shop in Aberdeen , which *T*-1 is sort of reasonably nearby</COREF></COREF> and it *EXP*-2 was leaked *-3 that <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> the piano that someone was going *-5 to play *T*-4 at <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the wedding</COREF> .
Reportedly , it was Elton John who *T*-1 was going *-2 to play a song for <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Guy</COREF> and <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">the shop</COREF> was inundated *-3 when <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was leaked *-5 *T*-4 and people just wanting *PRO*-6 to touch <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the piano that *T*-7 was going *-8 to be in the same room as <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Madonna</COREF> and <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Guy Ritchie</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> imagine 0 the locals could be kind of swooning for quite a while because <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">Sting , who <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess 0 *T*-1 might be singing at <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the wedding</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife introduced <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the couple</COREF> .
Brad Pitt , Gwyneth Paltrow , Robin Williams , George Clooney , any other 0 people around there are specially fond of *T*-3 ?
Well , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 that is the most unusual thing about it .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have some friends who *T*-1 live up in there next to the woods and people are just surprised that <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would choose <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">this little tiny village in <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Scotland</COREF></COREF> .
It is the juxtaposition of that glamour , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean a Gwyneth Paltrow in <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Inverness</COREF> .
It just does n't sound what they are thinking about *T*-1 .
And , of course , Stella McCartney *ICH*-1 is there too and apparently Celine Dion .
But it is pretty amazing , all these Hollywood stars in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">this quiet , sleepy village that *T*-1 is n't really famous for anything</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> must be a real boom to the local economy ?
Oh absolutely , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean it *EXP*-5 's been estimated *-6 that <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">3 million pounds , which *T*-1 is about 5 million dollars</COREF> , will be made *-2 over the next few weeks in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Dornoch</COREF> just from journalists and celebrities and sort of sightseers <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess coming *PRO*-3 to see where <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Madonna</COREF> got <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">married</COREF> *T*-4 .
Gosh , this must be you know about five thousand times the local budget there .
Yeah , absolutely .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 they 'll know what *PRO* to do *T*-1 with <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">all that money</COREF> out there .
There is only so many sheep 0 you can buy *T*-1 .
But <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">the Scottish Tourist Board</COREF> are also planning on *PRO* cashing in on <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're estimating 0 some 60 million dollars will be made *-1 over the next few years , just with people coming *PRO*-2 to see the sight of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Madonna</COREF> and Guy 's</COREF> wedding</COREF> .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Garith McClain , covering <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Madonna</COREF> - <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Guy Ritchie</COREF> wedding</COREF> for <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the London based Guardian newspaper</COREF> speaking to us from Edinburgh , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Scotland</COREF> .</COREF>
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Garith</COREF> .
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
