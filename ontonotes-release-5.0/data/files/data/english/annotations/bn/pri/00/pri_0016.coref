This is <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The World</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a co-production of the BBC World Service , PRI and WGBH in Boston</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am Tony Kahn .
The drama in <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yugoslavia</COREF> seemed *-1 to climax last thursday when hundreds of thousands of protesters forced the ouster of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Slobodan Milosevic</COREF> *T*-2 , but now the events of last week are beginning *-3 to look like act I .
Talks <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> between <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">supporters of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yugoslavia 's</COREF> new President</COREF> <COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Vojislav Kostunica</COREF></COREF></COREF> and members of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the Milosevic 's</COREF> Socialist Party</COREF> yielded more heat than light .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Kostunica 's</COREF> people</COREF> accused <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the Socialists</COREF> of *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to hold on to the institutions of power and as if on cue , it *EXP*-4 was announced *-3 that <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">a key <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> loyalist</COREF> is taking over the Interior Ministry , which *T*-5 runs the police .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The World 's</COREF> Nenad Chebeck</COREF> is in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF> .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Nenad</COREF> , what do <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> know *T*-1 of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">this <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> ally</COREF> ?
Well , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's Mirco Merianovic who *T*-1 officially still is the Prime Minister of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Serbia</COREF> .
We have *-1 to keep one thing *ICH*-2 in mind that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Vojislav Kostunica</COREF> and the pro-democracy elements in <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Serbia</COREF> and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yugoslavia</COREF> have taken over authority on <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the federal level</COREF> , but the key leaders of power are on the republican level .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yugoslavia</COREF> consists of <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">two republics</COREF> , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Serbia</COREF> and Montenegro</COREF> and there were no elections for neither the Serbian parliament , nor the presidency , so <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the Serbian government</COREF> officially is still in place .
But that 's all theory .
In practice things are slightly different .
The whole structure of power in <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Serbia</COREF> and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yugoslavia</COREF> was based *-1 on <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="PRI20001011.2000.2021.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one man</COREF> , <COREF ID="PRI20001011.2000.2021.mrg-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Milosevic</COREF></COREF> .
Once <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> collapsed , politically and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has collapsed when <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> resigned officially on national television *T*-1 , all the old structures of power collapsed together with <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
Well , what other indications are there *T*-1 since , although , officially you got two different parallel governments going on , the reality is that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Kostunica</COREF> is trying *PRO*-2 to <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">consolidate</COREF> <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> power over <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yugoslavia</COREF> , what other indications *ICH*-3 are there *T*-4 that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is having trouble *PRO* doing <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">The taking over of all the leaders of power</COREF> for <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Kostunica</COREF> and <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> allies is a process which *T*-1 definitely takes time .
Everybody is impatient , especially here in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF> and <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Serbia</COREF> .
The people that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> see *T*-1 on the street and that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hear from *T*-2 are sick and tired of <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> cronies</COREF> appearing on television *PRO*-3 protesting against <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and trying *PRO*-4 to hang on to whatever little power <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *T*-5 at the moment .
However , <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Kostunica</COREF> and <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the Democratic Alliance of Serbia</COREF></COREF> has said very openly <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> that <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will not put up with this kind of behavior for much longer .
<COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have indeed threatened <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> allies that <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are going *-1 to bring out the people onto the streets again so that a completely new authority can be established *-2 , not just on <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the federal level</COREF> , but also on the level of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the Republic of Serbia</COREF> .
*PRO* Let 's talk a little bit also about other important policies of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> , of importance to people outside <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yugoslavia</COREF> , and that is <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Kosovo</COREF> .
There has been <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">some news *ICH*-1 coming out that Yugoslav troops are going *-2 to return to <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Kosovo</COREF> by the end of the year</COREF> .
What can <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> tell *T*-1 us about what <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">this new government</COREF> will do *T*-2 in <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">that area</COREF> ?
Well , <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a report that *T*-1 was brought *-2 by <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">today 's</COREF> edition of <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="192" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Vetrivinia Novostate</COREF> , <COREF ID="192" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF> newspaper</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> quoted <COREF ID="195" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Zoran Zingic</COREF> , <COREF ID="195" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the main leaders in <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the Democratic Alliance</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-1 saying that Yugoslav troops and police will be policing <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">the borders between <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Kosovo</COREF> and other countries , meaning Macedonia and Albania</COREF> .
Basically <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not such a threatening sort of bit of a news as it might seem *-1 *?* at the moment because <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="214" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the United Nations resolution</COREF> , <COREF ID="214" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">1244</COREF></COREF> , does actually provide for the presence of Yugoslav troops and police on <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">the borders</COREF> .
That part of <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">the resolution here</COREF> and <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">the resolution</COREF> was never actually applied *-1 because right until now , the Yugoslav police and military were in the hands of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> , so <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">the international community</COREF> did n't want *PRO*-2 to have anything 0 *PRO* to do *T*-3 with the <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Milosevic</COREF> forces .
Well , how is <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">the international community</COREF> dealing at <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">this point</COREF> with the change of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> *T*-1 ?
Who is there *T*-1 and what kind of assistance are <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> offering *T*-2 or what is the symbolic value of <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> being there at <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">this point</COREF> *T*-3 ?
Well , at the moment it is a race , who is *T*-1 going *-2 to get to <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF> first .
Yesterday , we had the French Foreign Minister , <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> we have Budor Homback , who *T*-1 is the head of <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">the international community 's</COREF> Stability Pact for Southeast Europe .
We also saw <COREF ID="265" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the American diplomat</COREF> <COREF ID="265" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Willie Montgomery</COREF> who *T*-1 arrived in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF> <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> *PRO*-2 to set up most probably a meeting between <COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="272" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a senior U.S. official</COREF> <COREF ID="272" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">James O'brien</COREF> , who *T*-3 is coming to <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> will be here tomorrow as a special representative for President Clinton .
<COREF ID="271" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> will hold talks , probably behind closed doors , with <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">President Vojislav Kostunica</COREF> , but <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> is keeping a low profile because there is quite a lot of anti-American sentiment on the streets here in <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Serbia</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="283" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> realizes that very open support for <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Vojislav Kostunica</COREF> could do <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF> more harm than good at this moment .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The World 's</COREF> Nenad Chebeck in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Belgrade</COREF> .</COREF>
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> very much for *PRO* speaking with <COREF ID="304" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are welcome <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Tony</COREF> .
