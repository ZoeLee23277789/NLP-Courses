<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">The Oklahoma City bombing conspirator</COREF> is already serving a life term in federal prison .
State proceedings could bring the death penalty if <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Nichols</COREF> is convicted *-1 .
A trial date was not immediately set *-1 by <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the judge whose decision *T*-2 came as prosecutors were still presenting evidence</COREF> .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">A Texas woman</COREF> is in jail this morning *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">accused</COREF> *-2 of *PRO* killing <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> two sons and severely beating another the day before Mother 's Day .

Thanks very much .
Why were <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> there so quickly *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was n't really there that quickly .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> actually responded a few hours after the Sheriff 's Department did .
The reason 0 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> went *T*-1 was ?
Well , *PRO*-1 being the justice of the peace <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are the ones that *T*-2 hold the inquest on the death and they were required *-3 *PRO*-4 to call <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> to <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the scene</COREF> .
What did <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> see *T*-1 when <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> got there *T*-2 ?
Well , *PRO*-1 to be honest with you , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">a pretty gruesome sight</COREF> and <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's been talked about *-2 quite a bit the last few days and if <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">anybody</COREF> did n't have *-3 to be there *PRO*-4 to see <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were lucky *PRO*-5 not to have *-6 to be there .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a horrific sight , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do n't have *-1 to go into details , obviously , we can only imagine how bad <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> might have been *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> probably was *?* , indeed , based on <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> eyewitness accounts .

<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were collecting evidence as <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were there , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the law enforcement authorities</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> had been collecting <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> evidence and , of course , when <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> got there *T*-1 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> showed <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the location</COREF> and , of course , *PRO* then having *-2 to do --
