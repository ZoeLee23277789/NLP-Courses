It looks like an annual tradition is building .
80,000 people with a shared love of music converge on a Tennessee pasture for <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">three days of good vibes and who *T*-1 knows what else</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's called *-1 *PRO*-2 Bonnaroo .
*PRO* Check it out .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Bonnaroo</COREF> is kind of this going example of what <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the whole jam band community</COREF> is turned *-2 in *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">That *ICH*-2</COREF> 's what I really like *T*-1 about <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the jam community</COREF> , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> acceptance of improvizational music , despite whatever region or genre</COREF> .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's about the freedom of the music and the freedom of expression .
Well , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> sold all 80,000 tickets through <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> web site .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> sold out in 16 days .
I mean , the amazing thing is , 0 <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> used no traditional advertising .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> put all these bands together .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> draws <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">a huge audience</COREF> , so the record companies and the music business has *-1 to take all of these forms of music more seriously .
It 's like <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">strength in numbers</COREF> .
I hope 0 this kind of thing can <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">happen</COREF> in America , instead of <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> just being these isolated festivals like <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Bonnaroo</COREF> , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> really can happen in 100 cities every summer , like the festivals do *?* in Europe .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> only complaint is the overlapping .
You know , as a music lover that <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am *T*-1 , there 's five acts all playing at the same time on five different stages that <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-3 to see *T*-2 .
It really comes from the actual bands and the fact that there 's <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">this grassroots following that *T*-1 's been there , you know , for a long time , primarily started * by the Grateful Dead , at least the future by the Grateful Dead</COREF> .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> will get by <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will survive .
We 're carrying on a tradition that *T*-1 started a long time .
In American music , improvization is what it 's always been about *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's not just clapping and having a good time .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> makes you feel <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">a certain kind of love</COREF> , and hopefully , <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> translates in the community .
You go out .
You hug someone .
You do something good .
You make a better world .
For me , that 's music .
<COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> love you .
<COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> --
