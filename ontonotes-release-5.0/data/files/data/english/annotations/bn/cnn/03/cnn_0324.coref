<COREF ID="262" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> love <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">that phrase</COREF> , because <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a commitment *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">our nation</COREF> *PRO* to make *PRO* *EXP*-2 sure that not only does every child excel , but no child gets *PRO*-3 left *-4 behind .

In order *PRO* to make *PRO* *EXP*-1 sure 0 no child gets *PRO*-2 left *-3 behind , we must understand whether or not each child is learning *PRO*-4 to read and write and add and subtract .
If there are *?* , there will be plenty of praise .
If not , we will work *PRO*-1 to design programs *PRO*-2 to make *PRO* *EXP*-3 sure 0 no child gets *PRO*-4 left *-5 behind .
