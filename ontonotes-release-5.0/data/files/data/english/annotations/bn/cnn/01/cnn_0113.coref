Hello , I 'm Kathleen Kennedy , *PRO*-1 sitting in for Chuck Roberts .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> begin this half hour with the latest developments in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the presidential election</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Thousands of disputed ballots in South Florida</COREF> are being prepared *-1 for shipment to <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the state capital</COREF> amid tight security .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">A <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Tallahassee</COREF> judge</COREF> wants <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in case 0 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are needed *-1 as evidence in a lawsuit challenging <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's</COREF> certified vote , but there are growing signs 0 state lawmakers could step in and decide the winner .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">Jonathan Aiken</COREF> reports .
State legislators in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's</COREF> capitol are discussing if a special session is needed *-1 *PRO* to decide which 25 electors *ICH*-3 *T*-2 will represent <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Electoral College</COREF> -- a Democratic slate ? or a Republican slate ?
U.S. law allows state legislatures to <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">choose</COREF> representatives to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Electoral College</COREF> as a last resort .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> lawmakers may go <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">that route</COREF> , if <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the disputed recount</COREF> is n't settled *-1 by December six days before <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Electoral College</COREF> meets *PRO*-2 to verify the results of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the presidential election</COREF> .
Experts are telling <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's</COREF> lawmakers *PRO*-1 to act cautiously .
The right *PRO* to vote <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> clearly protected *-1 by the First Amendment .
I think that your action needs *-1 to take <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> into consideration .
As <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">lawmakers</COREF> consider <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> options , the legal fight over <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the recount</COREF> continues at several levels .
In Leon County , which *T*-1 includes <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Tallahassee</COREF> , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Circuit Court Judge N. Sanders Sauls</COREF> ordered <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">13,000 contested ballots from <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Miami - Dade</COREF> and Palm Beach counties</COREF> to be brought *-2 to <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Tallahassee</COREF> by <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Saturday</COREF> .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's when <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll decide if <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should be counted *-1 , along with contested ballots from Nassau County *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Miami - Dade County , for one</COREF> , is heavily Democratic , and it 's from these areas , <COREF ID="CNN20001129.1400.0017.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> officials believe 0 *?* , that a hand count of <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">ballots</COREF> will turn up enough votes 0 *T*-2 to overcome <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Governor Bush 's</COREF> lead *T*-1 .
In West Palm Beach Wednesday , <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">an independent , conservative group called * *PRO*-1 Judicial Watch</COREF> asked a court *PRO*-2 to let <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> see <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">those ballots</COREF> for <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> .
<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're here for <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">the public</COREF> , for <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">the public</COREF> should know what *T*-1 's going on without two adversaries that *T*-2 are fighting with each other .
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="CNN20001129.1400.0017.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Gore</COREF> camp</COREF> would prefer 0 the ballot counting from all disputed counties start immediately .
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's concerned 0 <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">the public</COREF> is losing patience with the legal challenges to the <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> vote .
As <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">this host of legal actions</COREF> makes <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> way through the <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> court system , attention is turning to <COREF ID="134" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the legal body of last resort in the United States</COREF> -- <COREF ID="134" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the U.S. Supreme Court in <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF></COREF> .
Oral arguments *ICH*-2 will be heard *-1 Friday on a request *ICH*-3 by the <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> campaign *PRO* to overturn <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">a decision by <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's</COREF> Supreme Court</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">ruled</COREF> that recounts submitted * to state officials after a filing deadline had passed had *-1 to be counted *-2 .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">Jonathan Aiken</COREF> , for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> , <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> .
