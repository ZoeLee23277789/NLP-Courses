<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">General Brooks talking about three major points .</COREF>
One is <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the capture of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">number 24 as <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's described *-1 , Samir who *T*-2 is responsible for the <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> district</COREF></COREF> .
Indications are 0 the Kurds in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the north</COREF> handed <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this man</COREF> over so <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is number 4 out of that playing card deck of 55 that the U.S. is after *T*-1 , top leaders in Iraq .
Also <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">that bomb site in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">hit</COREF> * about a week and a half ago</COREF> , the Mansour district .
No remains identified *-1 just yet , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">General Brooks</COREF> says *T*-3 , but only the initial surveys have been completed *-2 so far .
There is strong speculation that Saddam Hussein may be <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> two sons were inside of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">that building</COREF> when <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">hit</COREF> *-1 by coalition bombs *T*-2 , or may have left prior to <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the bombing</COREF> taking place .
Again , all this is an outstanding issue right now .
In <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the north</COREF> , you 're going *-1 to hear a lot about <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the shallow graves</COREF> today *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">At least 1500 , maybe 1600 graves</COREF> located *-1 in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the north</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Jane Arraf</COREF> has made <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> way to <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">that location</COREF> and <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030418_063040.1.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> heard <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> first live report about an hour ago and <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030418_063040.1.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will talk with <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Jane</COREF> again .
<COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030418_063040.1.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> know that , quote , work will be done *-1 with the Iraqis and that work will come , <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030418_063040.1.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are told *-2 0 *?* , in the coming days .
