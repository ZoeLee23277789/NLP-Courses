Well , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> 15 minutes on top of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> brought <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> 50 years of fame .
Today , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Sir Edmund Hillary</COREF> being named *-1 *PRO*-2 an honorary citizen of Nepal , *PRO* to mark <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> historic climb to <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the top of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Mt. Everest</COREF></COREF> with <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Sherpa Norgay</COREF> .
There is concern 0 *PRO* climbing <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Everest</COREF> has become too common , and perhaps a bit too commercial .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 we have <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
We do n't have anything 0 *T*-1 to demonstrate <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">that commercialality</COREF> .
All right , *PRO* let <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> show you a little bit of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mt. Everest</COREF> , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the highest summit on <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the planet</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Some 3D imagery .</COREF>
There , you see , the big picture of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the southern part of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Asia</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll bring you down into <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the Himilayas</COREF> .
20 million years ago , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were formed *-1 when India broke off what *T*-2 was then a piece of Africa and slammed into <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">that portion of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Asia</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-3 creating <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">this tremendous mountain range , with of course <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Mt. Everest at 29,000 feet above sea level</COREF></COREF> *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">The highest peak of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">them all</COREF> .</COREF>
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">This 3D animation</COREF> kind of exaggerates it a little bit .
What <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> should tell you *T*-1 is 0 there are about 15 possible routes 0 *T*-2 to get you to <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the top of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Mt. Everest</COREF></COREF> .
What <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Sir Edmund Hillary</COREF> did *T*-1 and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Norgay</COREF> did *T*-1 was *PRO* go along this route that *T*-2 takes <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> across this valley --
You have *-1 to turn <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the picture</COREF> this way a little bit , shoot back over this range , and bring you up in here .
Then <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll try *PRO*-1 to give you <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> best guesstimation .
Basically , right along this ridge line up to 29,000 feet , into thin air , as it was popularly coined *-1 by the book by the name of John Crack Cower a few years ago .
Since that , a lot of people have tried , a lot of people have succeeded .
175 people have died *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to reach <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the summit of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Mt. Everest</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're joined *-1 by <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> guest -- where is <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> guest</COREF> *T*-2 , by the way ? who *T*-3 is in Kathmandu</COREF> .
And how 's the party going there *T*-1 ?
