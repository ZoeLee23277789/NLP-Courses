An occasion that *T*-1 marked the formal establishment between <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">our two countries</COREF> .
Since then <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">this relationship</COREF> has grown in importance to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">us <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">both</COREF></COREF> through good times and bad .
Both of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> generation and <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Britain</COREF> have special pause *PRO* to remember the unacceptable sacrifice 0 the Russian people made *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to defeat fascism in <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the Second World War</COREF> .
Nothing , not even the fact that <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> countries</COREF> became estranged in <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the war 's</COREF> aftermath , has ever dimmed <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> memory of the scale of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> loss .
That experience should continue *-1 to inspire <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> , as <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> seek *PRO*-2 to build a more peaceful and secure world .
When <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> visited <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> country</COREF> in 1994 *T*-1 , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> recall *PRO*-2 saying to <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">President Yeltsin</COREF> that <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF></COREF> spent most of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> lives *PRO*-3 believing 0 such a visit would never happen , and that <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hoped 0 <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was as delighted *ICH*-4 as <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was *?* *PRO*-5 to be proved *-6 wrong .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm just as delighted *ICH*-1 now , nine years later , *PRO*-2 to be able *PRO*-3 to welcome <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> here and to learn about the great changes which *T*-4 have occurred in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> country</COREF> since <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was there .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF> has established <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> as <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> partner and <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> friend .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> work together bilatarily and on the international stage , and <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are developing new links *ICH*-1 all the time in fields of commerce , culture , counterterrorism , energy , education environment .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will be seeing evidence of some of this during <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> visit .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. President</COREF> , it *ICH*-1 is , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe 0 *?* , a sign of genuine friendship that <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are able *PRO*-2 to have disagreements , but remain firm partners .
It *ICH*-1 is no secret that the significant differences between <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> two countries</COREF> earlier this year on how best *PRO* to handle Iraq *T*-2 , but <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are now able *PRO*-3 to look forward together firmly in agreement on the route 0 <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have decided *T*-4 in the United Nations , although , the tragic loss of British lives today reminds us all of the difficulties 0 *T*-5 to be faced *-6 .
But as <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> look ahead , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> know that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> long - term partnership</COREF> <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> of profound importance to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">both of us</COREF> .
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is clearly evident , if <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> look beyond the challenges of international politics .
In the last few months alone , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have heard the announcements of major investments in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF> by British companies .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have also heard a different sign of Sir Paul McCartney playing to enthusiastic crowds in Red Square , and <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> , in turn , have been enthralled *-1 by the celebrations of <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> own city</COREF> in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Petersburg</COREF> .
At the same time , work continues *-1 to bring the young people of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> countries</COREF> closer together through language , teaching , school exchanges and university programs .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">a vibrant and exciting relationship from which <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">we <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">both</COREF></COREF> derive mass benefit *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. President</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> country</COREF> is rich --
