Reporter :
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is what <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">12 - year - old Ali</COREF> has been asking for *T*-1 , what <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> doctors have been praying for *T*-2 , and what the outside world has been demanding *T*-3 .
Finally , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. Marines</COREF> arrived at the hospital where <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ali</COREF> has survived since <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> horrific injuries 18 days ago *T*-1 .

When <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ali</COREF> awoke this morning *T*-1 , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could scarcely believe that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> would really be the day when <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be taken *-3 abroad for the treatment 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> so desperately needs *T*-4 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was hopeful , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> eyes were bright .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> talked to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> about football , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> favorite players .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Friends and relatives</COREF> arrived <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .

<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were horrified *-1 by <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> injuries</COREF> and pleaded for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to get specialist treatment outside Iraq .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> doctor</COREF> , too , is grateful that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ali</COREF> is getting <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">this chance</COREF> .

Armed men now roam the wards .
Fighters , too , are being treated *-1 here .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's woefully overcrowded and chaotic .
In <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">these conditions</COREF> , it *EXP*-1 's a miracle 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ali</COREF> has survived here at all .

In <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">these primitive conditions</COREF> , without drugs , <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the pain</COREF> is excruciating for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ali</COREF> , and far too traumatic 0 *PRO* to film *T*-1 .
*PRO* Putting <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">a little boy</COREF> through <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">such agony</COREF> reduces <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> doctor to tears .
