On <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> go *T*-1 in the meantime .
Again , today , there were disturbing hints , and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> underscore hints here , that coalition forces may soon face an attack using chemical weapons .
Yesterday the story centered on intelligence regarding enemy intentions .
Today the evidence is somewhat more tangible .
Reporting for <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">CNN 's</COREF> David Ensor .
Reporter :
The evidence *ICH*-1 is accumulating that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> may be planning *PRO*-2 to use chemical weapons .
Gas masks turning up in abandoned trenches .
In Nasiriyah in a building marked * as a hospital <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. Marines</COREF> found <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">weapons , atropine antidote kits</COREF> , and <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was not all .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> found over 3,000 chemical suits and gas masks as well as a number of Iraqi military uniforms .
Reporter :
The findings are heightening concerns among coalition forces approaching <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> since , as <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqis</COREF> should know *?* , U.S. and British forces do not use chemical weapons .
U.S. officials say 0 some intelligence indicates 0 <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">a red line</COREF> may have been drawn *-1 around <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the capital</COREF> with <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030325_220534.6.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Republican Guard</COREF> units ordered *-2 *PRO*-3 to use chemical weapons once U.S. and allied troops cross <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
There is also intelligence , officials say 0 *?* , suggesting 0 <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030325_220534.6.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Republican Guard</COREF> units have been issued *-1 artillery shells containing chemical agents .
There has been <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">intelligence scraps , who *T*-1 knows how accurate <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *T*-2 , chatter in the system , that *T*-3 suggests that the closer that *ICH*-5 coalition forces get *T*-4 to <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> and Tikrit the greater the likelihood and that some command and control arrangements have been put *-6 in place</COREF> .
Reporter :
In <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz</COREF> repeated <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> government 's</COREF> stand -- <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does not have any kind of weapons of mass destruction .
