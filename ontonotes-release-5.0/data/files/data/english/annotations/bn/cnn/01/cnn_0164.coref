<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> has learned that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the crew of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole ''</COREF></COREF> was not briefed *-1 on the seriousness of the threat in Yemen , nor warned *-1 *PRO*-2 to be on guard for possible terrorist attack the day 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the warship</COREF> was bombed *-4 *T*-3 .

While many were not required *-1 because <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the `` Cole ''</COREF> was refueling in the harbor , not at a pier , others were judged *-2 to be significant lapses , according to sources .
For instance , the ship protection plan filed * by <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the `` Cole 's ''</COREF> commanding officer</COREF> of terrorism and warned *PRO* to be suspicious and inquisitive of strangers .

0 Those precautions were not taken *-1 either , sources say *T*-2 .
The 40 - foot hole in the side of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the `` USS Cole ''</COREF> has now been patched *-1 , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the warship</COREF> is in Mississippi for repairs that *T*-2 will cost $ 240 million *U* and take a year 0 *PRO* to complete *T*-3 .
Senior Navy officials are still debating the fate of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Commander Lippold , who along with several subordinate officers , *T*-1 could be subject to career - ending discipline , if it *EXP*-2 's judged *-3 0 the security lapses left <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the billion - dollar destroyer</COREF> *PRO*-4 more vulnerable to attack</COREF> .
