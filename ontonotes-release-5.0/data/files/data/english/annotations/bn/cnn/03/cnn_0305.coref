We were waiting for the Iraqi refugees to show off .

On April 9th , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">about 130 journalists from around the world including <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF> and a couple of reporters</COREF> , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were going *-1 to try *PRO*-2 to cross the border because <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were all desperate *PRO*-3 to get into <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> .

<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> came across a checkpoint and there were about maybe five , six Iraqi locals with AK machine guns and checking cars .
