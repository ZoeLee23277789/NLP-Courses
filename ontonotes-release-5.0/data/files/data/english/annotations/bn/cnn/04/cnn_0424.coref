<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The NASA</COREF> and the European Space Agency both launch missions to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF> this month *PRO*-1 sending rovers and ashters 0 *T*-2 to probe <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the Red Planet</COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">One of the big questions about <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF></COREF> is when or whether humans will ever be able *PRO*-2 to visit *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's an idea plagued * with unsolved problems .
The latest issue of `` Popular Science magazine '' takes a look at the challenges 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">NASA</COREF> is facing *T*-1 .
Joining <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> is *T*-1 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the contributing editor</COREF> .
Good *PRO* to see <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Jeff</COREF> .
*PRO* Thank you .
It was only about 30 years ago when we went to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the moon</COREF> *T*-1 .
So what 's the difficulty in *PRO* <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">being</COREF> able *PRO*-2 to <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">go</COREF> to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF> *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's unimaginably difficult and different .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF> is at most times 100 million miles away from <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a nine - month trip .
Then if <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> stay there for about a year or two , the whole trip could last about three years .
We 're talking about conditions where there 's <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">radiation in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">space</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">cosmic radiation that *T*-1 could cause cancer</COREF></COREF> *T*-2 .
The communications conditions once you 're on <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF> , *PRO* just to talk to people on <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">earth</COREF> , there 's a 20 minute delay in the conversation .
So the -- you know , the issues are so much larger than *PRO* going to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the moon</COREF> .
And for now , it 's 250 days , which *T*-1 seems *-2 to be the maximum for astronauts in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">space</COREF> anyway , but as <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> say *?* , it 's a much further travel .
But *PRO* let <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030622_173306.9.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> talk about some of the hurdles that *T*-1 hamper humans to be able *PRO*-2 to survive there .
The dust , for one thing .
Cataracts another .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030622_173306.9.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> talk about the right kind of spacecraft that *T*-1 would be able *PRO*-2 to allow humans *-3 to actually get that far and to survive .
Right .
Well , first of all , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the spacecraft</COREF> would not be launched *-1 from <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Earth</COREF> .
You 'd have *-1 to launch <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> from in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">space</COREF> already , which *T*-2 means 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> would have *-3 to build <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">space</COREF> .
So that means 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need a good shuttle that *T*-1 's going *-2 to take <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> back and forth *PRO* to build <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the spacecraft</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *-1 to come up with <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the fuel that *T*-2 will take <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the Earth 's</COREF> orbit <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">all the way</COREF> to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's probably going *-1 to be nuclear propulsion at this point again something 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have n't really developed *T*-2 yet , because <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> could n't carry that much fuel , obviously .
Liquid oxygen would be way too heavy 0 *PRO* to carry *T*-1 <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">all the way</COREF> to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF> .
The bigger issue is 0 once <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> get there , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> ca n't carry oxygen or water or food *PRO*-1 to stay there three years , so <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-2 to have *-3 to do all of that on the surface of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the planet</COREF> .
And *PRO* think of it .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF> is carbon dioxide , so we ca n't breathe there .
So <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-1 to have *-2 to come up with some conversion technique 0 *T*-3 to create water , *T*-3 to create oxygen and then some way of *PRO* growing food on <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the planet <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">All of this</COREF> is in the works now , but <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-2 's going *-1 to take quite a few years *PRO* to develop <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> talk about <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the cosmic radiation</COREF> .
Then of course there is the zero G bone loss , almost like the eroding of bone to humans that would be at risk as well .
Absolutely .
There could be as much as 50 % bone loss in <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">astronauts in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF></COREF> .
Why ?
During the time in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF> .
Because when the body has *T*-3 -- when there is no gravity as there is *?* on <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> does n't pick up <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">the calcium in <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the bones</COREF></COREF> , so <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't keep *-2 getting <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the bones</COREF> stronger and stronger , so <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will just lose <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will be almost like old people even at the age of 40 .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Jeff Rothfeder .</COREF>
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> for *PRO*-1 joining <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
*PRO* Looks like it will be some time before <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> make <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> way to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Mars</COREF> .
That 's it for <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
But before <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> go , a look at what *T*-1 's coming up <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">next week</COREF> .
A controversial incinerator just about ready *PRO*-1 to destroy weapons at an Anniston , Alabama , military facility .
What might *T*-1 be the risk to people downwind .
That story and much more coming up <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">next week</COREF> .
Coming up next on <COREF ID="255" TYPE="IDENT">`` CNN Live Sunday ''</COREF> a look at America 's storage of gas .
<COREF ID="255" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's followed *-1 by `` People in the News '' profiling Harrison Ford and Harry Potter .
At 8:00 Eastern , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> presents Road to Baghdad .
