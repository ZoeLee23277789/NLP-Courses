*PRO* Welcome back to `` People in the News . ''
<COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030614_173123.4.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The intifada</COREF> , <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030614_173123.4.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the spontaneous 1987 Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation</COREF> , heralded the rise of the Muslim fundamentalism , in what *T*-1 had been <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">a mostly secular Palestinian movement</COREF> .
The most popular of these groups <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas , an acronym for Islamic Resistance Movement</COREF> .
In English <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> means zeal .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> aim -- the destruction of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> is an Islamic movement .
At the very beginning , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was encouraged *-1 by <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> because <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was a counter weight to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palestinian nationalism which *T*-2 is , of course , a secular movement</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> was founded *-1 in 1988 by <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">a blind paraplegic cleric who *T*-2 was influenced *-3 by the Islamic Muslim Brotherhood</COREF> .
With backing from <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> set up <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">charities</COREF> in <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the improverished Strip</COREF> in the 1970s .
Slowly <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> became more and more politicized , and more and more extreme in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> demands for an Islamic state .
The extremism took the form of suicide bombings and terrorist attacks , but <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> had already become an important part of Palestinian society through <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> charity work and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> influence increased over time by *PRO* providing community services when <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the Palestinian Authority</COREF> did not *?* *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> plays on <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the Palestinian Authority 's</COREF> failure *PRO* to produce .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> basic message , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the Palestinian Authority</COREF> is corrupt , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> fails *-1 to deliver , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> is not corrupt , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> cares about the person on the street and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does deliver .
Unfortunately , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030614_173123.4.mrg-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">those same charitable organizations</COREF> , <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030614_173123.4.mrg-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">those same charity committees</COREF> that *T*-1 funnel the funds to needier Palestinians</COREF> , also serve *PRO*-2 to support terrorist attacks .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> and the United States say 0 <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Arafat</COREF> has not been tough enough on terrorism , and have attempted *PRO*-1 to force <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> out of the current peace process .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">The Prime Minister known * as Abu Mazen</COREF> must now contend with the rejection of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">side by side Palestinian and Israeli states</COREF> , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a cornerstone of the new peace plan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's trying *PRO*-1 to get <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> to co-exist with <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> .
Conservative Israelis are skeptical .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is not working against <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is working in tandem .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is negotiating with <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is not telling <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to disband and regulate <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> weapons , so I have no faith in the ability *ICH*-2 of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Abu Mazen</COREF> *PRO* to put terror aside .
Reporter :
Settlers call <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the just concluded Israeli - American - Palestinian summit</COREF> *PRO*-1 a surrender , and were not impressed .
Translator :
<COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">The armed intifada</COREF> must end and <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> must use *RNR*-1 and resort to *RNR*-1 peaceful means in <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> quest *PRO* to end the occupation and the suffering of the Palestinians , and the Israelis , and to establish the Palestinian state .
<COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> and other Palestinian militant groups</COREF> rejected <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Abbas '</COREF> call *PRO* to end <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> attacks with a deadly raid on an Israeli Army outpost in <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Gaza</COREF> .
We are all saying that the resistance will continue despite <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the summit in Aqaba</COREF> .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030614_173123.4.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">retaliated</COREF> on <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> , <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">namely Al - rantissi</COREF> .
<COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030614_173123.4.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> missed <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and killed civilians .
Translator :
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> will not drop <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> weapons , even if all leaders are assassinated *-1 .
Reporter :
Since <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the second intifada</COREF> began in 2000 , over 700 Israelis have been killed *-1 .
During the same time there have been more than 2,000 Palestinian deaths *ICH*-1 according to the Red Crescent , including <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> leaders targeted * for assassination .
If you want an end to terrorism , if you want an end to violence , you have *-1 to give <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> hope and you have *-2 to give <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> a stake in <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">the political process</COREF> .
I think that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> is ready *PRO*-1 to join <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">the political process</COREF> , however , if the only price for the political price is 0 you must <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">fight</COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> , if <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are requiring <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Abu Mazen</COREF> *PRO*-3 to do *T*-2 , <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are almost mandating that <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will fail .
The main test of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Mahmoud Abbas</COREF> , will be *PRO* to establish an overall command of all armed groups .
If not , it does n't have a chance .
You know , leaders have *-1 to do things --
