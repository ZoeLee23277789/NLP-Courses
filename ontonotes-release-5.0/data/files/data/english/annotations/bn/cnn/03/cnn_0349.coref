Well , joining us now , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the chairman of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the Securities and Exchange Commission</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">William Donaldson</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">MR. chairman</COREF> , it *ICH*-1 's good *PRO* to have <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> here .
Nice *PRO* to be here , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Lou</COREF> .
*PRO* Let 's start with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">that surprise</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the malfeasance that *T*-1 is crossing <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> desk</COREF> .
Are <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> suggesting 0 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">corporate America</COREF> has not learned <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> lesson yet ?
Well , no .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">that quote</COREF> is a little out of context there .
There are a number -- there are <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">15,000 companies in the United States</COREF> , and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 the great bulk of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> are very honestly managed *-1 and so forth .
There have been a few -- a number of people have had egregious fraud and so forth .
There 's been a general loosening of morals across the board .
What <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was referring to *T*-1 in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">that quote 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> had *T*-2</COREF> was the number of cases 0 <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> see *T*-3 day in and day out at the lowest levels , scams and so forth , where considerable amounts of money are being made and lost *-4 by relatively small investors *T*-5 .
Is the investor today in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> judgment secure ?
Well , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that the -- the marketplace is becoming increasingly secure .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 a number of <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the reforms that *T*-1 have come via the Sarbanes - Oxley Act</COREF> and a number of things that <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have done *T*-2 at <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF> are basically making <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">everybody</COREF> take a new look at how <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're performing <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> duty as a director *T*-3 , how <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're performing <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> duties on audit committees and compensation committees and in <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street</COREF> *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the reforms that *T*-1 came as a part of the large settlement</COREF> are going *-2 to change the way 0 research and investment banking are done *-3 to the betterment of the individual investor *T*-4 .
And some people *ICH*-1 are surprised and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> might even add pleased *ICH*-2 in this city that <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> SEC</COREF> has been quick *PRO*-3 to react when Phil Purcell of Morgan Stanley made a statement that <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> SEC</COREF> did n't think *RNR*-7 and that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> did n't think *RNR*-7 0 *T*-5 expressed appropriate contrition when Bear Stearns stepped out of line in the view of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF> *T*-4 *T*-6 .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was n't a polite phone call quietly made * , either from <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> enforcement division or from <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> office , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was rather public .
Is that the way 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're going *-1 to operate *T*-2 ?
Well , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Lou</COREF> , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're deadly serious about *PRO* bringing reform into the marketplace .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're deadly serious about some of the actions 0 <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've taken *T*-1 , and when <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> see <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">people who *T*-5 do n't appear *-2 to be taking it too seriously</COREF> *T*-3 , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-4 to get to <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> right away .
And <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 perhaps no one more surprised than some of the people running those firms on <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> have also expressed concern about <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">excessive executive compensation , particularly CEO compensation</COREF> .
Is there really anything that *T*-1 can be done *-2 about <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">this problem</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think so , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Lou</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 the real next step here is for <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">compensation committees</COREF> to spend a little more time than <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do on what <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're really compensating for *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 there 's been too much emphasis on performance defined * strictly by stock performance and earnings per share .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 there are <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">a number of other measures that *T*-1 tell how -- or indicate how well somebody 's doing *T*-2 *PRO*-3 running a company</COREF> , and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 corporation boards need *-4 to spend more time on <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">that dimension</COREF> .
And with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you as Chairman of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF></COREF> exercising <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> bully pulpit , one assumes that --
