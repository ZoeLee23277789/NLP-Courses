In <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> today , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">some people</COREF> are <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">viewing</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> past through the eyes of an American .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Thomas Nybo</COREF> has <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">that story</COREF> .
When <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Fidel Castro</COREF> and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> rebels</COREF> stormed <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Havana</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were joined *-2 by <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">an intrepid American photographer who *T*-3 spoke little Spanish</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> name is <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Burt Glinn</COREF> , and now <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">most Cubans</COREF> are getting <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> first look at <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> photos on display in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Havana</COREF> until the end of the month</COREF> .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">The collection</COREF> is called *-1 *PRO*-2 `` on the road to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Havana</COREF> with <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Fidel</COREF> , '' and is made *-1 up of 41 black and white images .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Some of the other photographers that *T*-1 were there</COREF> had *-2 to go back to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> newspapers and had *-2 to go back to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> offices *PRO*-2 to send <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> film in , but <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> stayed because , to <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was more than a news event .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was about history , so <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wanted <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the whole story</COREF> .
*PRO* Capturing <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the whole story</COREF> was not easy .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Glinn</COREF> borrowed money from friends *PRO*-1 just to get to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> , and had *-1 to shoot many of the photos barefoot after <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> lost <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> shoes while *PRO* being pushed *-2 in a crowd .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">The resulting photos</COREF> show the passion of <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the Cuban people</COREF> and the charisma of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> new leader , standing at the center of it all , just as <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is *?* 42 years later</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Glinn</COREF> is 75 *ICH*-1 now -- about the same age as <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Castro</COREF> -- and this is <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> second trip back to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> since <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the revolution</COREF> .
When <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> looks back at <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> long career , including stints in South Africa and the former Soviet Union *T*-1 , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">one assignment</COREF> stands out , and <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was the most exciting , because <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> turned out *-2 to be not a story about <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Fidel Castro</COREF> .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> turned out *-1 to be a story about <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the Cuban people</COREF> , and how <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> received <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the revolution</COREF> *T*-2 , and <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's so important , because the visions that <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">foreigners *ICH*-4</COREF> have *T*-3 -- particularly Americans -- about <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the revolution</COREF> are completely different .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do n't understand the kind of popular joy that *T*-1 was here .
While some might disagree about <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba 's</COREF> present , and plot different courses for <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> future , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">these photos</COREF> may help <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Cuba</COREF> better understand <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> past .
