We turn now to an Iraqi --
First of all , before <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> tell you about this story , 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were going *-1 to *?* *T*-2 , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are live pictures from <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> .
There 's been some activity in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the last few moments</COREF> .
*PRO* Looks like tracer fire 0 we 're looking at *T*-1 , anti-aircraft guns firing at what they sense 0 *T*-2 is some sort of threat coming from the skies .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> has had sporadic episodes of this tonight .
No major explosions 0 we 're aware of *T*-1 , but just , apparently , in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the last few moments</COREF> , there has been <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">activity</COREF> .
You can see <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> there just now .
We 've been reporting , 0 <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> has begun *-1 to see <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> electricity</COREF> turned *-2 back on .
We do n't know that all of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is back , but at least some of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *?* .
We also know that 12 miles southwest of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> , coalition forces remain largely in control of what *T*-1 was formerly <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein International Airport</COREF> , now renamed * by <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the coalition</COREF> *PRO*-3 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad International Airport</COREF> , but <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the coalition</COREF> is quick *PRO* to point out that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not have control of the area immediately surrounding <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the airport</COREF> .
Again , this is -- <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are live pictures of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad , where it is well into the night *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're , of course , going *-1 to keep *-2 monitoring the situation there and bring you up to speed on anything 0 <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> learn *T*-3 .
