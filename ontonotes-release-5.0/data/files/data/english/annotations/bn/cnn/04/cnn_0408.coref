Seven minutes before the top of the hour .
At the beginning <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> told about this incredible story about <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the rescue of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">three fishermen</COREF> in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the waters off the coast of Vancouver</COREF> , *PRO* stuck *-1 in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the waters</COREF> , gale force winds , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">small boat</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">rescued</COREF> *-1 by <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">a cruise ship that *T*-2 happened *-3 to be in the neighborhood</COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Those three men</COREF> did n't realize how lucky <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were *T*-1 until <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were plucked *-2 out of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the water</COREF> .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have with <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Captain Kent Ringboard , on board <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the Royal Caribbean `` Radiance of the Seas</COREF></COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> understand 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were on <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">board</COREF> when <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this rescue</COREF> happened *T*-1 .
Were <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">charge</COREF> ?
Yes , that 's correct <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">charge</COREF> .
*PRO* Tell <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> about what *T*-1 happened here .
What was it *T*-2 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were looking at *T*-1 when <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> looked out over <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the waters</COREF> *T*-3 ?
Well , it was quite windy , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">gusty winds up to 40 , 50 miles an hour</COREF> , and <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> came from southeast , and <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> got the alarm this distress situation just before 5:00 in the morning , and <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were on relatively slow speed for the time being , but <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> of course , speeded up to the position , which *T*-1 was given *-2 , and we -- after an hour , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> spotted <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the fishing boat</COREF> in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the waters</COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">These men</COREF> were in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">some water that *T*-1 was quite frigid</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stayed out there for long <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could have suffered severe tragedy , perhaps .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to ask <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , Have <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ever done anything like <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> ? Have <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ever seen anything like <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> done *-2 ?
No , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have never seen <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">this type of operation where you have a fishing vessel disappear , more or less *T*-1 , and that <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the survivors</COREF> , they had *-2 to go into <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030617_112838.4.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the water</COREF> , pick <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> up from <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030617_112838.4.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the water</COREF></COREF> .
Was there any point at which <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> did n't think 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> would be able *PRO*-2 to pull <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> off *T*-1 ?
Sorry , please *PRO* say again ?
Was there any point at which <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> would n't be able *PRO*-2 to <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">pull</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> off *T*-1 ?
No , absolutely not .
We -- we were 100 % sure 0 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> could make it , absolutely , because <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> came very close to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the vessel</COREF> , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> rescue boat out soon .
So <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> felt confident about <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the fishermen</COREF> also <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">had</COREF> the surviving suits on , so <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> gave <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> more time 0 *PRO* to help *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> was a good thing for <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
What about <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> crew that *T*-1 was actually involved *-2 in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the rescue here</COREF></COREF> ? are <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> trained *-3 for <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">this sort of thing</COREF> ?
Yes , <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are very much well - trained .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> train for <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">this type of operation</COREF> at least every 14 days .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm hopeful 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">those three fishermen</COREF> bought <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> a glass of wine once <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> got <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> on <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">board</COREF> .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> gave <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> some .
<COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">These incredible pictures .</COREF>
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not sure if <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have been able *PRO*-1 to see some of <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">these pictures playing on the television sets around the world</COREF> but we look at <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">these pictures</COREF> and think 0 there 's no way 0 a cruise ship , as big as it is *?* , will be able *PRO*-2 to maneuver into position in these kinds of heavy seas *PRO*-3 to save <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">three corks out there on <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the water</COREF></COREF> *T*-4 .
Amazing .
It was interesting , but <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had a good maneuvering capability on .
