Martha Stewart is n't the only corporate figurehead in the news today .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">The jury</COREF> has handed down a $ 30 million *U* , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">a Grand Rapids jury</COREF> saying 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taco Bell</COREF> has *-1 to pay <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the true creators of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the Chihuahua mascot 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">two men</COREF> claimed 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> idea originated *T*-3</COREF></COREF> , and proved 0 <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am in the wrong business .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taco Bell</COREF> is appealing .
Joining <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> is *T*-1 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Tom Rinks with <COREF ID="20" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> attorney</COREF> <COREF ID="20" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Doza</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Tom</COREF> , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 've got *-1 to be happy with the settlement .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going *-1 to appeal , but first tell <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> how <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> came up with <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the Chihuahua character</COREF> *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Joe</COREF> and <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's the partner , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were looking *PRO*-1 to design some licenses 0 *PRO*-3 to put *T*-2 on some t - shirts , and at the time big dogs were big , and all the mean dogs , and no fear was a big hit , and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> thought 0 it was time for a bit of a change for the 18 crowd .
So <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> actually took the opposite of all that , and looked for <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the smallest , weakest , most timid animal</COREF> , and tried *PRO*-1 to make <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> cool , tried *PRO*-1 to make <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> big , and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> knew 0 if he gave <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> some spunk , everybody would root for <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
How did <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taco Bell</COREF> folks</COREF> run into <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> actually came to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> at <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">a licensing show</COREF> .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> had been licensing to a bunch of different manufacturers , and in 1996 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were at <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">a show in New York City where Nick Loada and Universal Studios , and <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taco Bell</COREF> walked up to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> and said 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were looking for a masscot for <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> brand and <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> would be perfect *T*-1</COREF> .
That started <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">a year relationship 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had *T*-1 with <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> .
And <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> went on for a year , and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did n't pan out and then <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> pick up a trade paper and read 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going ahead with <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ?
After <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'd finalized all the commercials , and actually done the campaign for <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> hired a new ad agency , and telephone calls just started *-1 staggering off .
Then <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stopped *-1 coming , and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> heard about <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the ads</COREF> , and <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were exactly what <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had presented *T*-2 for over a year .
When <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> first heard <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , or read <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> *T*-1 , did <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> just go ballistic ?
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean , no offense , but it was <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> and <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">one other guy</COREF> who *T*-1 created <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">this thing</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're a huge , huge corporation .
Yeah , it was devastating , *PRO* to say the least , but <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> really did n't know --
