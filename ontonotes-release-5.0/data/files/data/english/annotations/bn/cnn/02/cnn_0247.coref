*PRO* Welcome back .
25 minutes after the hour .
Time for the Cafferty file .
Good morning .
A crazy world 0 we live in *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">The Supreme Court of the United States</COREF> upheld <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the toughest three strikes law in the country</COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">California 's</COREF> .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> rejected challenges to <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the law of sentences of 25 years to life without parole for a man convicted * of *PRO* stealing some golf clubs and 50 years for a man who *T*-3 stole some videotapes</COREF> .
The idea is 0 if you have three felony convictions , you 're out of here .
The voters overwhelmingly passed <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> in 1994 *PRO* to offset the liberal and lenient judges who *T*-1 let bad people off with nothing more than a slap of the wrist .
They appealed to <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> on behalf of these two people .
Currently in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">7000 people</COREF> serving 25 year to life sentences under <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the three strikes law</COREF> .
One - third of them -- not that , 300 of <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> are in there for things like petty theft .
25 other states that *T*-1 have the three strikes law .
And that brings us to <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the question</COREF> .
It was a close vote .
5 in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> .
Here is *T*-1 <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the question of the day</COREF> .
You can e-mail us at am@cnn.com .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's designed *-1 *PRO* to counter the kind of thing that I found *T*-2 in the New York newspaper this morning where <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">a Brooklyn woman who *T*-3 scalded <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> 4 - year - old</COREF> to death in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">a bathtub</COREF></COREF> , walked out of court *PRO*-4 a free woman <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> *PRO*-4 sentenced *-5 to <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">five years probation</COREF> *T*-6 .
It *EXP*-1 took <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the child</COREF> three weeks *PRO* to die in the hot from -- hospital from the injuries 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> suffered *T*-2 at the hands of <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> mother</COREF> and <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's free .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Five years probation for *PRO* killing <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> 4 - year - old</COREF> by *PRO* scalding <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to death in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the bathtub</COREF> .</COREF>
