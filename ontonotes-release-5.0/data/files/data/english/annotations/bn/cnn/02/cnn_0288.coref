<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Peterson</COREF> disappeared on <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Christmas eve of last year</COREF> .

Reporter :
Well , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Lou</COREF> , one thing that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the coroner</COREF> has been able *PRO*-2 to determine *T*-1 is that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the skeletal remains</COREF> <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">those of one , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">an adult female</COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">two , the remains of <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the almost full - term baby boy</COREF></COREF> , and of course , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is significant because <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Laci Peterson</COREF> , when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">disappeared</COREF> from <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030415_183752.14.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Modesto</COREF> home *T*-3 , was 7 1 / 2 months pregnant .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> was on <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Christmas Eve</COREF> .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> husband</COREF> , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Scott</COREF></COREF> , at the time said that <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was fishing in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Berkeley marina</COREF> .
Now , in a strange twist in all of this , just yesterday *PRO* separate from <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the skeletal remains 0 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> alluded to *T*-1 earlier</COREF> <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">a man hiking near <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Berkeley marina</COREF></COREF> found <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">a bone</COREF> , and they are now looking at <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> as another possible lead in <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">This person</COREF> came across <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the bone</COREF> at the shore .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> brought <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> home and contacted the authorities , and we took possession of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
And you 're trying *PRO*-1 to connect <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to the other --
Well , we 're trying *PRO*-1 to find out if <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a human bone and whether or not <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is related to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the others</COREF> .
Reporter :
And yet another reason why <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">that bone</COREF> could be a key link *T*-1 , there are reports *ICH*-3 that *T*-2 have surfaced that in terms of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the female remains that *T*-4 were found *-5</COREF> the skeleton was not completely intact .
Now <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> is also taking on a rather , we should say 0 *?* , almost a TV episodic forensic pathology angle because they 're going *-1 to bring in <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">an expert on what *T*-2 's called *-3 *PRO*-4 alufating decay</COREF> , and basically <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">this person</COREF> is going *-5 to come in here and look at <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> .
This is in the damage aspect of it .
And they say 0 these experts will be able *PRO*-1 to tell how long <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> had been in there *T*-2 and if <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the remains of <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the almost full - term baby boy</COREF></COREF> were inside <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the female 's</COREF> remains</COREF> at the time of death .
Also , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the coroner</COREF> could know right now *RNR*-1 but is not saying *RNR*-1 if there was some sort of trauma to either of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">these skeletons</COREF> .
For example , if <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could see the bone compromised *-1 in some way <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could tell if there had been a stab or a shooting .
We may learn a lot more on this in just 15 minutes .
That 's because <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030415_183752.14.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Modesto</COREF> police</COREF> have scheduled <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">a news conference</COREF> and while <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may not say much at all <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could also drop some major bomb shells , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Lou</COREF> .
*PRO*-2 Reporting live from <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">Martinez , <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm Paul Vercammen .
Now back to <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Paul</COREF> , *PRO* let <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> ask <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , if <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> may *?* , quickly , are we expecting -- is there any reason 0 for <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> to expect that there would be the ability *PRO* to identify <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">those remains</COREF> as a result of these autopsies this afternoon *T*-1 ?
Reporter :
It sounds like all of this will be too quick , and it seems 0 *PRO* underlying all this is 0 there could be an absence of dental records .
That 's particularly important for <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the adult female remains</COREF> .
So now <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going *-1 to <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> *-2 to turn to DNA , and <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's why <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're calling in these experts *T*-3 .
Some DNA testing can be very quick , but sometimes it can take up to weeks , even more , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Lou</COREF> .
Okay .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Paul Vercammen</COREF> , *PRO* thank <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> very much .
As <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Paul</COREF> just reported *?* , <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030415_183752.14.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Modesto , <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF></COREF> police department</COREF> will be holding <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">a news conference</COREF> just a few minutes from now , and CNN of course will be carrying <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">that news conference</COREF> live .
*PRO* Stay with us .
