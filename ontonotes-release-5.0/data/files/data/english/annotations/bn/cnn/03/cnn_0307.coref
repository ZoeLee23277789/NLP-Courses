There is more outrage about perks for executives , both from angry employees and from shareholders as well .
Andy Serwer `` Minding Your Business . ''
Shame on them .
The big focus is <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">American Airlines</COREF> , the board of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> meeting today , *PRO*-1 possibly discussing the future of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">CEO Don Carty</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> got in trouble when <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> jacked up pensions of the guys in top while *PRO*-3 asking employees *PRO*-2 to take big pay cuts , $ 1.8 billion *U* *T*-1 .
Last night , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">former General Electric CEO Jack Welch</COREF> talked to Paula Zahn about this issue of corporate greed .
*PRO* Let 's listen to what *ICH*-2 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had *T*-1 0 *PRO*-4 to say *T*-3 .
It 's one of the parts of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> that *T*-1 is great .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> want more and <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want other people to have less .
That 's part of the system .
And annual meeting , every year , 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> went *T*-1 they complained about executive salaries , even though the team that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> managed *T*-2 increased shareholder value to $ 600 billion *U* that shareholders received *T*-3 , the larger shareholders being employees .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it 's really a question of degree .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean , <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that CEOs should make millions of dollars *PRO*-1 running companies .
There are tens of thousands of employees , billions of dollars of revenue .
A million dollars *ICH*-1 is okay , maybe 5 million .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">$ 100 million *U*</COREF> to <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> too much money .
Who *T*-1 decides <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> ?
*PRO* Seems *-1 subjective .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">The board</COREF> is who *T*-1 decides <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> and <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">board</COREF> is so often chock full of <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the CEO 's golfing buddies</COREF> .
<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> serve on each other 's boards and <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">problem here</COREF> is 0 gap between what the average worker makes *T*-1 and CEO is making *T*-1 is increasing and everyone agrees 0 <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is not a good thing for <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF> , plus the fact , 0 when the guys get the big packages *T*-2 , so often you see the companies going down the zblubs .
*PRO* Thank you for *PRO* updating us .
Back over to Bill .
*PRO* Thank you .
Jack looking at <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">SARS</COREF> .
Talking about the <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">SARS</COREF> threat worldwide this morning .
The World Health Organization says 0 there are 4200 <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">SARS</COREF> cases *ICH*-1 so far , more than 250 deaths in 27 countries and there is no cure , and nobody knows what *T*-2 is causing <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
The question is , Would you change your plans because of the threat of <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">SARS</COREF> ?
A lot of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">responses</COREF> , as in hundreds and hundreds of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , beginning --
