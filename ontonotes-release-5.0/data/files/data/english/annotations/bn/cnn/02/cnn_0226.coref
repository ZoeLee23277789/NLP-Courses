No one seems *-1 to be sure what *T*-2 's happened to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> and <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> two sons</COREF></COREF> , but one thing *ICH*-3 is becoming more clear -- <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Uday</COREF> and Qusay</COREF> were just as bad as <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> father</COREF> if not worse .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">`` Time '' Magazine 's Michael Weisskopf</COREF> has uncovered <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">some stunning details about the lives of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">these two</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> joins <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> now from Washington .
Thanks for *PRO* taking the time 0 *PRO* to join <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Michael</COREF> , as <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> read <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the article</COREF> , we knew that <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> were not good guys , *PRO* putting it mildly , but as <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> saw and heard <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the revelations</COREF> , what were <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> reactions *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're stomach turning , *PRO* to put it bluntly .
0 The extent of the depravity was truly stunning , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're right *T*-1 and <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> took different paths , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">these two guys</COREF> .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The younger of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the two brothers</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Qusay</COREF></COREF> was a very professional killer who *T*-1 pulled the trigger with political aim in mind .
We have eyewitnesses to <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> orders of execution of hundreds of people in 1991 during the Shiite Muslim uprising .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="CNNHL_ENG_20030526_221156.39.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> brother</COREF> , <COREF ID="CNNHL_ENG_20030526_221156.39.mrg-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Uday</COREF></COREF> , was very highly personal , arbitrary , spontaneous in <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> attacks , extended * to young girls , to friends , to employees .
It was just extraordinary .
With <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Uday</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean , the stories , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> open <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the article , what <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> cowrote *T*-1</COREF> <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">this article</COREF> <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Sum of Two Evils , The Reign of Terror</COREF></COREF> with <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam 's</COREF> sons</COREF> abducting <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">a 14 - year - old</COREF> , raping <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> , crashing wedding parties *PRO*-2 to rape the brides .
Was that about as bad as <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> got *?* with <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">these guys</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess 0 <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ca n't get much worse .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> thought that the depth may be how <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> treated <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> friends *T*-1 , and there are a couple of stories 0 we heard *T*-2 about how <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> forced <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">friends</COREF> *PRO*-3 to drink large quantities of grain alcohol until <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> vomited *T*-4 .
Also <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">one friend 0 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was afraid 0 *T*-1 was going *-2 to leave the country and spill the beans on <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> arrested *-3 by <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> Fedayeen Saddam .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> held *-2 down , tongue pulled *-1 out by pliers and sliced *-1 off with a scapel .
Awful .
People still fear <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
How did <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> get <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> to talk *T*-1 ?
Were <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> forthcoming or pretty reticent about *PRO* talking about <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">these guys</COREF> ?
It was a hard report .
It *EXP*-1 was hard *PRO* to find <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> , and then hard *PRO* to get <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to talk .
Over time , <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> gained trust .
<COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> promised *PRO*-1 to hold on to <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">people 's</COREF> anonimity if <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> could *?* .
After a little while , after <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> primed the pump , <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to *?* .
