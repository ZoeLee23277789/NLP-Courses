As <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> said *?* , earlier this week , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Christine Todd Whitman</COREF> <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030525_160525.13.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">stepped</COREF> down and now a whole lot of analysis is taking place as to why <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030525_160525.13.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">stepped</COREF> down *T*-1 , the job 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's done *T*-2 when <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was in office *T*-3 and the job that *T*-4 has yet *-5 to be complete .
From <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> New York bureau as I was introducing *?* a moment ago , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Dan Fagen</COREF> , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the environment writer for News Day</COREF></COREF> .
and <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Whitman</COREF> did consider <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> sort of the Republican environmentalist , but now there 's been an awful lot of Monday night quarterback quarterbacking taking place now that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's stepped down .
What do <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> suppose 0 *T*-1 took place here ?
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 many people have watched <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">this administration</COREF> in action and watched <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Christy Whitman</COREF> in action .
The mystery is that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> took the job in the first place or did n't leave earlier .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> quite a misfit for <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">this administration</COREF> , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> showed <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> over and over .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> was not good at all at *PRO* communicating <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> message to the public and certainly to the environmental groups and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was even worse at *PRO* bringing the <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">EPA</COREF> bureaucracy , the <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">EPA</COREF> environmental policy makers ' message to <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">this administration</COREF> because <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> saw <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> undercut *-1 over and over .
That 's interesting because *PRO* leading into it , while <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was New Jersey governor , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> sued <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the EPA</COREF> and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was very much considering <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> to be an environmentalist , and then *PRO* only to end up *-1 becoming the head of <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the EPA</COREF> and then of course , there was a lot of criticism over relaxed regulations .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> hear what *ICH*-2 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had *T*-1 0 *PRO*-4 to say *T*-3 last Wednesday here on CNN just after *PRO*-5 announcing <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030525_160525.13.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> resignation</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not leaving because of clashes with <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> , in fact , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have n't had any .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> report to <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> , and <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has always asked <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *PRO*-1 to give <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> best unadulterated advice .
We have have been on <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the same page</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was never supportive of <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">protocol</COREF> because <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did n't do what everyone needs *-1 to get *T*-2 done *-4 as far as climate change is concerned .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030525_160525.13.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">leaving</COREF> now because it <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriate time 0 *PRO* to do <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030525_160525.13.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Dan</COREF> , do <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> agree with <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriate time</COREF> .
Do <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> suppose for personal reasons or perhaps <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was out of step with <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm sure that it was difficult for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">her personally</COREF> , but <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 the commuter marriage perhaps would have been less stressful if everyday <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did n't see <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> being undermined and overruled *-1 .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean if <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Christy Whitman</COREF> and the White House were on <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the same page</COREF> , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've seen a book large enough 0 *T*-1 to contain a page that big .
Over and over there were many , many instances over the last --
