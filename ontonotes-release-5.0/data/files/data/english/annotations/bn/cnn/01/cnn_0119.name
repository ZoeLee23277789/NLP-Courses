<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nickelodeon</ENAMEX> 's latest cartoon series is about a boy with a disability .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gloria Hillard</ENAMEX> takes a look at what the show `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pelswick</ENAMEX> '' means to some children .
Imagine being able to visit <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nickelodeon</ENAMEX> to see how they make cartoons .
Here 's the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Beavers</ENAMEX> and all his friends .
Cool .
That 's awesome .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">15 - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicky Barischoff</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">12 - year - old</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allison Gray</ENAMEX> are best friends .
They 're also each other 's biggest fans .
She 's the singer .
Like , I ca n't sing .
I 'm not going to even try .
She 's the writer .
I am the writer .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicky</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allison</ENAMEX> also have cerebral palsy , and their visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nickelodeon</ENAMEX> coincides with the network 's debut of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pelswick</ENAMEX> , '' an animated series about a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">13 - year - old</ENAMEX> boy in a wheelchair .
As much as I 'd love to spend every day after school sucking up to teachers instead of hanging with my friends , I do n't want this job .
The series is created by nationally syndicated cartoonist and author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Callahan</ENAMEX> , who is a quadriplegic .
We just felt he understands how to reach people and how to reach kids .
I think kids lead the way .
Kids lead the way in diversity , because they 're very accepting of other kids in terms of who they are , and who they really are as people .
We 're normal people , and that 's what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pelswick</ENAMEX> was , he was just a normal kid .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fox TV 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">`` Malcolm in the Middle ''</ENAMEX> also features a young boy who uses a wheelchair .
These are good cookies .
Yeah .
They 're good .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allison</ENAMEX> says she hopes there will be other shows that feature kids like her .
That way --
I 'll just be another kid in a classroom .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> best friends met in acting school .
Now they 've got a chance to see what it 's like to be a voice actor for cartoons .
Like anyone hearing their own voice for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time , well , they giggled a lot .
This is so weird .
And when they heard their cartoon voices --
How are your voices sounding in there ?
I 'm so working here .
My dream is to become a playwright , an actress .
I would love to be a diva .
And those dreams were a little closer to coming true <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this day</ENAMEX> , and with shows like `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Pelswick</ENAMEX> , '' they say -- well , when they get a little older , maybe people wo n't even look down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> .
I 'm not down here .
I 'm up here .
