<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> begin <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will finish .
Applause
d the extra $ 400 *U* per child to American families <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">this year</COREF> , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">2003</COREF></COREF> .
All together these tax reductions will help 92 million Americans , and a significant part of the benefit to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> economy</COREF> will come within the first two years of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">A family of four with an income of $ 40,000 *U*</COREF> would receive a 96 % reduction in federal income taxes .
Instead of *PRO* paying $ 1,178 *U* per year , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the family</COREF> would pay $ 45 *U* a year .
Applause
That means <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">extra money in the family budget</COREF> year after year .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">That money</COREF> can cover a lot of bills .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">That money</COREF> can help <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">families</COREF> with purchases 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have been delaying *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">That money</COREF> will be in circulation , which *T*-1 will be good for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> economy</COREF> .
Applause
And <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">this plan</COREF> will help <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> small business sector .
The benefits of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the growth plan</COREF> will come from increased consumer spending and , as importantly , from a lower income tax rates on <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the small businesses <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF></COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is important for <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030415_103039.0.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> fellow citizens</COREF> to understand that <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">most small businesses</COREF> pay <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> business taxes at the individual rates .
Most small businesses are sole proprietorships , limited partnerships , are subchapter SS , and , therefore , when you reduce individual tax rates *T*-1 , you benefit small business formation .
As a matter of fact , under <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">this plan</COREF> , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">some 23 million small business owners</COREF> will see <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> taxes cut *-1 , which *T*-2 leaves more money for investment , more money for growth , more money for job creation .
A growing economy also needs small business investment , and <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> tax code should encourage investment .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">a small business</COREF> can deduct a maximum of $ 25,000 *U* in <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the year in which <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> buy equipment *T*-1</COREF> .
We need *-1 to triple the amount that *T*-2 can be deducted *-3 in <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the year in which <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> buy equipment *T*-4</COREF> .
Applause
So <COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> propose to <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> that they ought *-1 to limit -- <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">limit</COREF> ought *-2 to be increased *-3 to $ 75,000 *U* and <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">that limit</COREF> ought *-4 to be indexed *-5 to inflation .
By *PRO* doing so , we promote greater investment in machinery , and when <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">a small business</COREF> <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">buys</COREF> machine *T*-1 <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> enhances <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> company 's productivity as well as <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> means 0 machinery manufacturer is likely *-2 to have more work available .
More investment equals jobs , and what we are interested in *T*-1 in this administration is helping people who *T*-2 look for work find a job .
Applause
We can also promote economic growth and job creation by *PRO* <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">removing</COREF> <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the double tax on dividends</COREF> .
Applause
*PRO* Taxing corporate income once is fair .
It *EXP*-1 is not fair for the federal government to tax the same money twice .
The burden of <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">double taxation</COREF> falls on the millions of individuals who *T*-1 receive dividends , falls especially hard on seniors who *T*-2 receive half of all dividend income .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">Removal of <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">double taxation</COREF></COREF> would put more money in the hands of investors .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> would encourage more investment in American businesses .
Economists say that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">this plan</COREF> will help <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> stock markets , and since <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">half of American families</COREF> own stock , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the reform</COREF> will help <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> save and help <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> economy</COREF> grow .
Now , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">these measures</COREF> were presented *-1 to <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> in the first week of <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The pro-growth package</COREF> was urgent in January .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's even more urgent <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> .
Applause
It *EXP*-1 is important for <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">you all</COREF> to understand *RNR*-2 and for <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030415_103039.0.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> fellow Americans</COREF> to understand *RNR*-2 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the tax relief that <COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have proposed *T*-3 and will push for *T*-3 until enacted</COREF> would create -- applause will create 1.4 million new jobs by the end of 2004 .
In two years time , <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">this nation</COREF> has experienced war , a recession and a national emergency , which *T*-1 has caused <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our government</COREF> to run <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">a deficit</COREF> .
The best way 0 *PRO* to reduce <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the deficit</COREF> *T*-1 is with more growth in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> economy</COREF> , which *T*-2 means more revenues to <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> treasury , and less spending in Washington , D.C .
applause
<COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am pleased that <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">both the House and Senate</COREF> have passed budget resolutions that *T*-1 show real spending restraint , and now <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">the Congress</COREF> must focus on <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">a robust and effective growth package</COREF> .
We need at least $ 550 billion *U* in <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">that package</COREF> because the more tax relief that *T*-1 goes to <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> , the more jobs we will create *T*-2 in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">this economy</COREF> .
Applause
The last few months have been a time of challenge for <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> .
<COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> resolve has been tested *-1 , yet <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have the great resources of national strength , and national character , *PRO*-2 to overcome every challenge 0 <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> face *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> confidence and <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> optimism have never waivered .
<COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are defending the peace of <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> .
<COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're bringing freedom to corners of <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> who *T*-1 have n't seen freedom in years .
<COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're all building the prosperity of <COREF ID="279" TYPE="IDENT">our country</COREF> .

<COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to thank <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">each of <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF></COREF> for <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> hard work .
