*PRO* Looking at like pictures of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Air Force One now on the ground at <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">a Royal Air Force base outside of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Belfast , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Ireland</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's called *-1 *PRO*-2 Aldergrove , just outside <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Belfast</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">The President of the United States</COREF> coming for a brief two - day summit with <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the British Prime Minister</COREF> <COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tony Blair</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 'll be talking about a postwar Iraq among other important subjects .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 'll also have an opportunity *PRO* to review the so - called road map for Israeli / Palestinian peace negotiations to get off the ground .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also want *PRO*-1 to review what the status *ICH*-3 is *T*-2 of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Ireland</COREF> right now as that peace process seems *-4 to be taking hold .
Been relatively quiet in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Ireland</COREF> over the past few years .
This is the third time in as many weeks that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Prime Minister Blair</COREF></COREF> will be sitting down *PRO*-1 to review station , war strategy , as <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> go forward together , go forward as close allies in *PRO* trying *PRO*-3 to help *PRO* put together <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">a new Iraq</COREF> *T*-2 .
There are some significant differences in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> strategy , including what role precisely *ICH*-2 the United Nations should have *T*-1 in *PRO* determining <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the future of <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 'll try *PRO*-1 to thrash all of that out .
You 're looking at <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the picture of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Air Force One taxiing in on the tarmac , *PRO*-1 getting ready for <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
As <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> watched <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">this picture of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the Air Force One</COREF> getting into <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this airport</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to bring in <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> military analyst</COREF> <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">General Dan Crisman</COREF> 0 *T*-2 to go over what *T*-3 happens is happening in <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* Seems pretty far away from <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Belfast</COREF> right now , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">General</COREF> , but decisions that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">these two leaders</COREF> make *T*-1 could have a significant impact on <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the future of <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF></COREF> .
First of all , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">General</COREF> , <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll keep <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">this picture *ICH*-1</COREF> up of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Air Force One</COREF> , talk about what <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> sense 0 *T*-2 is happening on the streets of <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> right now .
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Wolf</COREF> , it 's clearly <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030407_130604.10.mrg-E7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="104" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the final phase</COREF> , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the endgame</COREF> which *T*-1 is unfolding right now</COREF> .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030407_130604.10.mrg-E7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's very significant not only in <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> but <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Basra <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> .
You have <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">coalition forces there in some strength</COREF> .
Apparently three battalians of the U.S. 3rd Division in <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="122" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">three coalition assets</COREF> , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">three huge battle groups</COREF> in <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Basra <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> which the U.K. has *T*-1 there</COREF> .
What <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've developed *T*-1 here , <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Wolf</COREF> , over the last several weeks is very clear and increasingly clear intelligence as to what <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the final remnants of the regime leadership</COREF> are *T*-2 in terms of where <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are embedded *-4 in <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the cities</COREF> *T*-3 .
What <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're doing *T*-1 is going in now , very carefully , obviously some symbolic raids against palaces , but the more important presence is *PRO* to go after what intelligence delivers *T*-4 and that 's where <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">these key leaders</COREF> are located *-3 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're going *-1 to be defended *-2 fanatically but intelligence *ICH*-3 is so crucial from aerial platforms and special ops personnel *PRO* to give <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the three assets the intel which <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need *T*-4 *PRO*-5 to close with *RNR*-6 and eliminate *RNR*-6 final remnants of the regime in <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">those citys</COREF></COREF> .
This is a very important final phase here , <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Wolf</COREF> , and it looks like the closure is coming here now more rapidly than we anticipated .
As <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> continue *-1 to watch <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Air Force One , now on the ground outside <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Belfast , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Ireland</COREF></COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll be watching <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> emerge from <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the plane</COREF> momentarily .
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll continue *-1 to have live coverage of that .
When <COREF ID="192" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Walter Rodgers</COREF> , <COREF ID="192" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">our embedded reporter with the 3rd Cavalry</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">three battalions of troops</COREF> are on the ground , inside <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> , have taken up positions <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going *-2 to spend the night there presumably *T*-1 , how many soldiers are we talking about *T*-3 right now ?
Between 700 and 1,000 .
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">The task forces</COREF> really , <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Wolf</COREF> are probably built *-1 around <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="211" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the M Bradley</COREF> <COREF ID="211" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the basic infantry fighting vehicle</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is the equipment of choice for a task force like this to go into <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> .
<COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> cannon , <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> ability *PRO* to implace <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">troops</COREF> and fire through the firing ports in <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">that Bradley vehicle</COREF> *PRO* to take <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in under protection .
<COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a very , very important piece of equipment .
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> are probably mechanized heavy task forces that *T*-1 have overhead aerial platforms 0 *T*-2 to provide direct support .
It *EXP*-1 's significant 0 the degradation of the Iraqi air defenses has allowed A - s , Predators , U - s , other assets to hover and loiter and provide the overhead protection to these tasks .
