Bombardment of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> continues <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> and over the past 20 minutes , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">explosions</COREF> rocking <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">central Baghdad</COREF> southern Baghdad , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the outskirts of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF></COREF> , and importantly , as <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the coalition forces , principally <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030403_180511.16.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. Army</COREF> forces</COREF> , move against <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein International Airport -- which *T*-1 is about ten miles outside <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the center of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF></COREF> --</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">those explosions</COREF> are intensified *-2 .
If we may again go to the wide screen of what *T*-1 appears to me *-2 to be Abu Dhabi television that *T*-3 is providing this picture , 3:20 a.m. in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> , live pictures again .
That it *EXP*-1 is very difficult *T* to discern whether or not <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is , in point of fact , the missiles that we have become accustomed to *T*-2 striking <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> environs , or whether <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is the large 2,000 pound JDAM bombs that *T*-3 have been striking targets selected * by the coalition in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> , or whether <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">these flashes</COREF> now represent artillery barrages as fighting continues *PRO* to take control of the -- *PRO* to take control of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam International Airport</COREF> .
Again , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">correspondents</COREF> , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">our correspondents with the -- embedded * with <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">these forces</COREF> , with <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in the field</COREF></COREF> , saying 0 in some cases <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can see the lights of the skyline of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> .
Over the course of the past two weeks , since this war began , something like 23,000 coalition sorties have been flown *-1 , and over the course of the past 24 hours , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">1,900 sorties</COREF> flown *-3 , and we are told *-4 that , of <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">850 *T*-5</COREF> were strike sorties , motor vehicle most of <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> directed *-6 against <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican Guard</COREF> .
As you know *?* , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican Guard</COREF> just outside <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> *PRO*-1 to defend <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> and <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein 's</COREF> regime , in principal .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Two of those divisions *ICH*-2</COREF> absolutely devastated *-1 , destroyed *-1 , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">the so - called Medina division , and <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> division</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> division</COREF> , of course , getting <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> name from the fact that <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is the <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Republican Guard</COREF> division designated * *PRO*-1 to defend principally <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> .
Four other divisions we are told *-3 0 *?* have also been hit *-1 very , very very hard and are principally trying *PRO*-1 to reinforce units .
VA also been hit *-2 very hard .
So we are seeing <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">a lot of what some of the military officials are calling *T*-1 *PRO*-2 a method that *T*-3 does not seem *-4 to be directed *-5 by one person from <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the center of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF></COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> raises <COREF ID="136" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">questions</COREF> , <COREF ID="136" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">questions that *T*-6 have been in front of us since <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">that first strike on March 19th against the location that the CIA military intelligence thought 0 *T*-7 was a place where <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> , perhaps <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> sons , were *T*-8</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">That preemptive strike 0 they put *T*-1 , I think somewhat elegantly</COREF> , trying *PRO*-2 to strike at the head of the snake .
New explosions <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">rocking</COREF> parts of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> .
We will continue *-1 to monitor <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
We , of course , will bring the word to you just as soon as <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030403_180511.16.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Army</COREF> and coalition forces</COREF> do take <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">control of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein International Airport , just on <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the outskirts of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> .
In southern Iraq today , <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">British forces</COREF> also moving closer to the center of <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="177" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the second largest city in Iraq</COREF> , <COREF ID="177" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Basra</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> captured an Iraqi base in an unused factory in the southern suburbs of <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">that city</COREF> .
