Okay .
Question of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> .
Here 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jack</ENAMEX> back with that .
Thank you , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> .
There 's a new poll out <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC News</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington Post</ENAMEX> poll that suggests that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> would support <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> military action against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> in order to keep the country from acquiring nuclear weapons .
According to the survey , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">56 %</ENAMEX> said they would back military force to block <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> from developing nuclear weapons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">38 %</ENAMEX> said they 'd oppose it .
That was the question <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</ENAMEX> .
Would you support the use of military force to block <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> from developing nuclear weapons ?
We have gotten <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> of responses beginning with this one from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> .
I support the use of military force <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> .
The problem is with all of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> forces busy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Balkans</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Philippines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> , can we be sure that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> are up to the job ?
Not bad .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sally</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Daytona Beach</ENAMEX> .
I think if we 're going to get this terror thing over with , I think we need to clear the countries that house them .
It would be deadly to let <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> get their hands on nuclear weapons employ I would support any action .
Karen Brights .
I do n't support <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> .
Why do we , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> , get to choose who has nukes and who does n't ?
Is n't that the responsibility of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kay Jones</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waterford</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> .
Sure , let 's invade <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> .
We 're already over there .
Besides the biggest cost to us next to the loss of life is transporting our troops overseas .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , it 's only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> letter off , we could call it a typo .
A little cruel .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> .
Nuclear weapons in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> , hope --
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Buzz</ENAMEX> writes no one wants to see a war , but no one wants to see <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">another September 11th</ENAMEX> even more , especially a nuclear <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">September 11th</ENAMEX> .
I would support military action in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> if it helps to stabilize that area of the world .
You see it going this way ?
You see it going this way ?
I do n't know .
