Hello , I 'm <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathleen Kennedy</ENAMEX> , sitting in for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chuck Roberts</ENAMEX> .
We begin <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this half hour</ENAMEX> with the latest developments in the presidential election .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Thousands</ENAMEX> of disputed ballots in South <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> are being prepared for shipment to the state capital amid tight security .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> judge wants them in case they are needed as evidence in a lawsuit challenging <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> 's certified vote , but there are growing signs state lawmakers could step in and decide the winner .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jonathan Aiken</ENAMEX> reports .
State legislators in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> 's capitol are discussing if a special session is needed to decide which <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> electors will represent <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Electoral College</ENAMEX> -- a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> slate ? or a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> slate ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> law allows state legislatures to choose representatives to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Electoral College</ENAMEX> as a last resort .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> lawmakers may go that route , if the disputed recount is n't settled by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six days</ENAMEX> before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Electoral College</ENAMEX> meets to verify the results of the presidential election .
Experts are telling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> 's lawmakers to act cautiously .
The right to vote is clearly protected by <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the First Amendment</ENAMEX> .
I think that your action needs to take that into consideration .
As lawmakers consider their options , the legal fight over the recount continues at several levels .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Leon County</ENAMEX> , which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Circuit Court</ENAMEX> Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">N. Sanders Sauls</ENAMEX> ordered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13,000</ENAMEX> contested ballots from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami - Dade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palm Beach</ENAMEX> counties to be brought to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tallahassee</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> .
That 's when he 'll decide if they should be counted , along with contested ballots from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nassau County</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Miami - Dade County</ENAMEX> , for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> , is heavily <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> , and it 's from these areas , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> officials believe , that a hand count of ballots will turn up enough votes to overcome Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> 's lead .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Palm Beach</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> , an independent , conservative group called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Judicial Watch</ENAMEX> asked a court to let it see those ballots for itself .
We 're here for the public , for the public should know what 's going on without <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> adversaries that are fighting with each other .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gore</ENAMEX> camp would prefer the ballot counting from all disputed counties start immediately .
It 's concerned the public is losing patience with the legal challenges to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> vote .
As this host of legal actions makes its way through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> court system , attention is turning to the legal body of last resort in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Supreme Court</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
Oral arguments will be heard <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> on a request by the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> campaign to overturn a decision by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Supreme Court</ENAMEX> .
It ruled that recounts submitted to state officials after a filing deadline had passed had to be counted .
