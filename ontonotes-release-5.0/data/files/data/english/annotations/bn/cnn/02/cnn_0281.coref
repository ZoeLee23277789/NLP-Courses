Now that Saddam Hussein 's regime has fallen is democracy the answer to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> people .
In <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> book</COREF> , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Fareed Zakar Ericks A</COREF> joins us now *PRO*-1 to talk about democracy and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq 's</COREF> future .
Good *PRO* to see <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
*PRO* Thank <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Paula</COREF> .
Good *PRO* to see <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> on a different network for a change .
That 's what *T*-1 happens when you sell books *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know .
*PRO* Let 's talk about what <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Barbara Starr</COREF> was reporting *T*-1 from the Pentagon .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says 0 there is an acknowledgment *ICH*-1 from those officials that there are not enough ground troops in place and particularly in Baghdad 0 *T*-2 to control what our Nic Robertson is saying 0 *T*-3 is a stage of anarchy in some parts of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> .
Do <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> underestimated <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030411_070039.21.mrg-E5" TYPE="IDENT">the day after</COREF> ?
I think because <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030411_070039.21.mrg-E5" TYPE="IDENT">the day after</COREF> came so fast and so suddenly in a way , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that there 's been a pattern here not just with <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">this administration</COREF> , but over the last ten years , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Bosnia</COREF> , Kosovo , Afghanistan , where we do n't quite recognize 0 when <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the old order</COREF> collapses *T*-1 , you very quickly have *-2 to rush in and fill <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with some kind of new order *T*-3 .
In the short term , that 's going *-1 to have *-2 to mean the American military , but the key question , which <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> try *PRO*-6 to address *T*-5 in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> , is What do you do *T*-7 after that ? What kind of authority do you create *T*-3 in a society going through this kind of transition .
And how do you know that the local Iraqi citizens will make up <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030411_070039.21.mrg-E7" TYPE="IDENT">this government</COREF> or are , in fact , interested in democracy *T*-1 ?
There 's no proof of that .
Well , the key here is 0 the only way 0 *PRO* to get <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">that kind of legitimate government</COREF> to have <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> look good *T*-1 is *PRO* to hold elections , but if you hold elections , you stop <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the whole process of *PRO* building a rule of law , creating courts , creating administration</COREF> .
We 've seen in the past in <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Bosnia for example</COREF> , 0 you held elections and <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">all of the old ethnic thugs</COREF> get into power because <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have organization and <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have money and <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stop <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the process of genuine building of democracy</COREF> .
There is this tension here which *T*-1 is 0 the only way 0 *PRO* to make this look good *T*-2 is *PRO* in some way get <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">legitimate Iraqi authority</COREF> , but the faster you get <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , the more likely you stop <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">this process</COREF> .
So what do <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think *T*-1 of <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030411_070039.21.mrg-E7" TYPE="IDENT">this interim government</COREF> ?
You got Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz saying that American and British military forces would play a leading role in *PRO* setting up an Iraqi government and then later draw civilians into the process .
Is <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> going *-1 to work ?
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will work if <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's truly broad - based and truly consensual , try and include <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">all different people</COREF> and including <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in *PRO* creating a constitution which *T*-1 would take a few years .
What <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> point *T*-1 out is the places where you 've had quick transitions *T*-2 --
