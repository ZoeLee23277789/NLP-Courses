We now return to `` People in the News . ''
Reporter :
For <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Martha Stewart</COREF> *PRO* seems 0 business is everything , and everywhere .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart</COREF> has found the road to fortune wherever <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> has traveled *T*-1 .
I think 0 the temptation for any successful entrepreneur *PRO*-1 to go global .
Reporter :
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> marketing vision also included <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">KMart</COREF> <COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a company that *T*-1 recently emerged from bankruptcy</COREF></COREF> .
Okay , girls .
Reporter :
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart</COREF> is associated *-1 with <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Kmart</COREF> since 1987 and been very successful .
The goal had been *PRO* to bring affordable style to the masse .
There 's a reason 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was successful *T*-3 , and <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the stuff that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's created *T*-1</COREF> people like *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's good , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's useful , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's appealing , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's attractive and <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's cheap .
Reporter :
Even as <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Kmart</COREF> struggled through financial difficulties , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart</COREF> stuck by <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 's hard *PRO* to <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">run</COREF> out on a partner that *T*-2 's down .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's not our style .
Reporter :
Now <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart</COREF> is hoping 0 people do n't run out on <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The celebrity</COREF> indicted * on <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">charges stemming from <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the sale of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030607_170312.6.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">ImClone</COREF> stock</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart</COREF> and former <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030607_170312.6.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">ImClone</COREF> CEO Sam Waksal shared <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">a broker who *T*-1 now also faces charges of obstruction of justice and perjury</COREF> .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> defense</COREF> has been that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had a standing sell order at $ 60 *U* and when <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the stock</COREF> fell below 60 *T*-1 <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the broker</COREF> was supposed *-2 to , you know make the trade .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> 's been standing with <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">that story</COREF> .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">The broker</COREF> standing by <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">that story</COREF> .
The only reason 0 <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not holding *T*-1 is because there are other people that the Merrill Lynch that investigated *T*-2 and did n't find proof 0 <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was actually the case .
Reporter :
After <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart</COREF> was charged *-1 by federal authorities Wednesday , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> lawyers</COREF> issued a statement in which <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> said , quote , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Martha Stewart</COREF> has done nothing wrong *T*-2 .
The accusation that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Martha Stewart</COREF> <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">sold</COREF> <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030607_170312.6.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">ImClone</COREF> shares</COREF> based on inside information proved *-1 to be false .
If <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> lied , then <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is the obstruction of justice charge .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's the criminal side .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's where the prison time comes in *T*-1 .
Reporter :
For <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart</COREF> , the fallout from the past year taken a tremendous toll .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Martha Stewart</COREF> told me that <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the investigation <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> had cost <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> about $ 400 million *U* , in decline in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> stock , legal fees , and lost business opportunities .
Reporter :
Ironic , *PRO* considering 0 <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the sale of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030607_170312.6.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">ImClone</COREF> stock</COREF></COREF> resulted in a gain of less than $ 50,000 *U* .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> 'll never fully recover .
You know , it 's almost like e.g. you get off <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">the hook</COREF> , but are you really off <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">the hook</COREF> because people always believe 0 you were guilty .
And it *EXP*-1 's hard *PRO* to win back that sort of brand equity that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's lost *T*-2 .
Reporter :
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart</COREF> is vowing *PRO*-1 to clear <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> name of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the charges</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> is so focused and so determined that <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">this investigation</COREF> , while terribly upsetting , has not been something that *T*-1 's stood in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> way .
As <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">only she</COREF> would *?* , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> said , *PRO* Look , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't lose any sleep .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> still sleep <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> three or four hours a night .
Reporter :
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart</COREF> is still taken *-1 aback by the reaction to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> legal troubles .
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's been stunned *-1 at how much joy so many people have taken *T*-2 at <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> misfortune .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> does n't quite understand that the perfectionism that *T*-1 made <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> so famous also makes people say , Oh , is n't it *ICH*-2 fun *PRO* to see someone like that have a big , big problem ?
Reporter :
A perfectionism reflected * in even the smallest details of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Stewart 's</COREF> life .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Martha</COREF> does n't like *PRO*-1 to talk about how unpleasant things have <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">been</COREF> *T*-2 , but you can get signals of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in surprising ways .
When we sat down to lunch *T*-1 , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had put out these beautiful chop sticks which I commented on *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said , in China , the person with the thinnest chop sticks has the highest social status , and of course , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">had</COREF> *-1 to get the thinnest chop sticks .
Then <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> paused and said , <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's why people hate <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *T*-1 .
Reporter :
*PRO* Love <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> or hate <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Martha Stewart</COREF> has tied every aspect of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> image to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> business .
Even <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> daily calendar turned into a marketing tool .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said to me once that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> life is `` The Truman Show '' and meant <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm always on .
From the time 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> get up *T*-1 until <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> go to bed , the whole world is watching .
Hello , everyone .
