Back to something <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly Wallace</ENAMEX> said .
She was talking about the somewhat blase attitude of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> .
We were looking at the front page of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Jerusalem Post</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the other day</ENAMEX> .
The big banner headline that day big and bold , was President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> issues ultimatum .
On the side column , as an afterthought , citizens told to carry gas masks wherever they go .
It gives you a sense of , perhaps what <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</ENAMEX> of tension and war will do to your mentality , but it does also say that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> are a bit more blase , if that 's a fair word for it , than perhaps we are .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> , when he talked earlier to reporters , mentioned that this effort is an effort , this war is an effort to make the homeland , our homeland , more secure .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John King</ENAMEX> , that whole issue of Homeland Security must be so much on the minds of so many government officials , given the level of the terror alert <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Reporter :
So far , so good is the assessment we 're getting from senior administration officials as they try to track what they worry about most .
As we have the strikes overseas throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , there will be retaliatory terror strikes , either by organized terrorist networks or sympathetic terrorists or people against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> in this country .
So far , so good .
No plans , we 're told , to raise the threat level , though it 's already at orange , which is high .
So <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Microsoft</ENAMEX> of the President 's business has been behind the scenes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
He 's the most senior of about a handful of senior administration officials , including the Vice President and the Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> .
The National Security Advisor fanning out , we 're told in phone calls to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than three dozen</ENAMEX> world leaders offering them an update on what is going on .
But we did hear from the President a bit earlier <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
We see <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> , a capitol under siege .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Cabinet Room</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the White House</ENAMEX> to portray a different image , trying to show in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , it 's business as usual , urgent business as , but still business as usual with Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Defense</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> on one side , Secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> on the other .
The President offered a brief statement in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Cabinet Room</ENAMEX> .
Call my cabinet together to review our strategies , to make the world more peaceful , to make our country more secure , to make the lives of our citizens as healthy and as prosperous as possible .
We heard from Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> who briefed us on the early stages of the war .
There is no question we 've set the finest of our citizens into harm 's way .
They performed with great skill and great bravery .
We thank them .
We thank their loved ones .
We appreciate their sacrifice .
We heard from Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Powell</ENAMEX> who briefed us on the ever - growing coalition of the willing , nations who support our deep desire for peace and freedom .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Over 40</ENAMEX> nations now support our efforts .
We 're grateful for their determination .
We appreciate their vision , and we welcome their support .
As well , we discussed the need to make sure we have plans in place to encourage economic vitality and growth .
We will continue to push for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Medicare</ENAMEX> system compassionate for your seniors .
We care deeply about the fact that some children in our society ca n't read .
We want the best of education for every citizen in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .
This cabinet is confident about the future of our country .
We 're confident we can achieve our objectives .
I 'm grateful for their service to their country .
Thank you all .
Reporter :
So even at the very early stages of a defining moment of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> presidency , the President trying to make the case his eyes and especially the eyes of his cabinet still on the domestic affairs of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> as the early prosecution of the war continues .
One thing the President said that will be the point of contention around the world , the President called it an ever - growing coalition of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> countries .
That is handful more nations that were actively involved in the coalition his father assembled 12 years ago for <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Persian Gulf War</ENAMEX> , but there is a significant difference , of course .
In this coalition , it is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> doing the overwhelming load of the fighting .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> forces on the ground , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Australian</ENAMEX> troops scheduled to take part , perhaps in some way .
In the last <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Gulf War</ENAMEX> , you had <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> forces on the ground , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrians</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudis</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Qataris</ENAMEX> taking up arms to expel <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Iraqi Armiy</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kuwait</ENAMEX> .
No such participation this time around .
ABC
the President says , This is a growing coalition , this is one of the big geopolitical debates going on around the world as the President --
