*PRO* Welcome back .
Check in with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jack Cafferty</COREF> as we look at the fountains outside of time answer life .
We were talking about the road map to Middle East peace and ran <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">a footage about <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the chicken</COREF> and these dogs</COREF></COREF> .
There is <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the picture</COREF> .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">The golden retrieverr on the left</COREF> had <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">a litter of pups</COREF> and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the chicken</COREF> got in the pen .
A real story , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're all hanging out .
It looks as though <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030501_063017.15.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the puppies in one of the shots</COREF> is <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">trying</COREF> *PRO*-1 to get lunch from <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the chicken</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is what <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030501_063017.15.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're doing *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">jack</COREF> !
We got a lot of e-mails to us on the East Coast who *T*-1 do n't know about the farm .
The answer is apparently , 0 you can get , you can not nurse a chicken .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Bill .</COREF>
There you go .
The question should be what is <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the chicken</COREF> getting *T*-1 out of this .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to go there .
I.K. in New Jersey a biology teacher , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can tell you without hesitation , 0 a chicken can not be nursed *-1 .
Only mammals that *T*-1 have distinct biological feature .
Chickens are also devoid of hen 's teeth , much to the satisfaction of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">those little puppies</COREF> .
You do n't -- city people ?
No .
Our viewers are nice , not nasty .
Here is *T*-1 the explanation .
This is the real deal .
Any farm kid knows that <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">certain animals *ICH*-2</COREF> can not see for a few days after <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're born *-1 , including puppies .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The puppies</COREF> <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">try</COREF> *PRO*-1 to nurse <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the chicken hen</COREF> .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> by feel , not sight .
A chicken hen is warm and comfortable , so <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> try <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> luck and eventually feel <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way back to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the mother dog where things work out better for <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm so glad 0 that 's cleared *-1 up .
We 'll get back to the --
