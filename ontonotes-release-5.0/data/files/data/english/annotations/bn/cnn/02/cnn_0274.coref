A live picture of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">United States</COREF></COREF> landing at an air field in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Ireland</COREF> .
Once <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets out of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the helicopter</COREF> <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll transfer to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Air Force One</COREF> *PRO*-1 to come home after a 20 - hour visit with <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the Prime Minister of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Great Britain</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> talked about a lot of things , about what peace in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF> could look like *T*-1 , what <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">post-war Iraq</COREF> could look like *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> talked about problems in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Ireland</COREF> .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're going *-1 to pause for a second *PRO*-2 to see if <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> see <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> hopping off <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this chopper</COREF> .
As you probably know *?* , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the Prime Minister of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the Great Britain</COREF></COREF> has been under great pressure *ICH*-1 at <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">home</COREF> and much of Europe *PRO* to support *PRO* giving <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> a very strong role in *PRO* stabilizing <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">The White House</COREF> had signaled consistently 0 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> wants <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Great Britain</COREF> to create a lead role .
We learned from John King , traveling with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> , that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the new Iraq</COREF> will be run *-1 neither by U.S. / British coalition or <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">United Nations</COREF> , but by the Iraqi people .
That some of what <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Prime Minister</COREF> and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">President</COREF></COREF> shared *T*-1 with reporters at <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030408_083034.11.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">news conference following <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> meetings</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The President</COREF> went on *-1 to say that an interim authority composed * of Iraq GRS inside and outside <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> will run <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> until a permanent government can be established *-2 .
Do you want *PRO*-1 to hang with <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the shot</COREF> ?
Okay , we 're going *-1 to stay with <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">this shot</COREF> .
We 'll talk more about what <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the two leaders</COREF> discussed *T*-1 at <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030408_083034.11.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the joint news conference following <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> series of meetings</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> really wanted *PRO*-1 to let folks who *T*-2 had any concerns about what the <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">U.N.</COREF> involvement might be *T*-3 to not worry .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> said 0 there will definitely be some kind of role for <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-1 's very important for the European nations to be on board with the plan , but once again , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> very much view the future of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> as *PRO* being that in Iraqi hands .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The President</COREF> greeting a number of dignitaries as <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets ready *ICH*-1 here *PRO*-2 to board <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Air Force One</COREF> on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> way home .
A little earlier this morning , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> spoke with <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">an Iraqi dissident who *T*-1 teaches and writes extensively on <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> wrote a book called * *PRO*-1 The Republic of Fear , the Politics of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Modern Iraq</COREF> , and <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> asked <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> about the news that <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> was targeted *-2 in yesterday 's strike and how Iraqis would react if <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> was killed *-4 *T*-3 .
