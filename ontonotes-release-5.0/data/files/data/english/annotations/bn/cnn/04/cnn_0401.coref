<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Bob Novak</COREF> 's here with the `` Inside Buzz . ''
I understand 0 there may be a rift among <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Republican leadership in the Houses</COREF> ?
Yeah , there 's a little tension between <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the House Majority Leader</COREF> , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tom DeLay</COREF> , and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> successor as <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">House Majority Whip</COREF> and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> former deputy</COREF> , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lloyd Blunt</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* Kind of came to light when `` The Washington Post '' had <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">a front - page story showing disagreement on <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the provision</COREF></COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">DeLay</COREF> had <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> taken *-1 out .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 've been disagreeing on <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">union opposed bill on flex time</COREF> .
There 's just a lot of feeling that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">DeLay</COREF> does n't feel 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Blunt</COREF> is doing <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the job</COREF> as well as <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Maybe <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're jossling for who *T*-1 's going *-2 to be the next Speaker .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 Dennis Hastert plans *PRO*-1 to step down soon anyway .
*PRO* Moving on to the Democrats .
What 's the speculation about <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">John Edwards</COREF> *T*-1 ?
Some of the national Democratic operatives think 0 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">John Edwards</COREF> is going *-1 to run for President and that <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> ought *-2 to get out and concentrate on *PRO* being reelected *-3 *PRO*-4 Senator of North Carolina which *T*-5 wo n't be easy .
Some people think 0 White House Chief of Staff would <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030612_160005.13.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> a stronger candidate anyway .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not sure if <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030612_160005.13.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's true , but there 's a lot of feeling 0 this presidental race --
