<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gary</ENAMEX> ?
Reporter :
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolf</ENAMEX> , hello to you .
It was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a very tense and nerve - racking day</ENAMEX> for the pilot who is stationed at this base near the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> border .
He flies one of the As behind me , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Warthog</ENAMEX> attack planes .
Took it out <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">early this morning</ENAMEX> .
Here 's what happened to him .
He was going on a mission south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> .
When he was close to his target area , all of a sudden he heard a noise .
Turns out it was an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> missile , a very likely a shoulder fired missile that hit his aircraft .
He realized the plane was going to crash so he ejected .
All these planes have ejection seats .
The pilots carry parachutes .
Ejected landed in the desert south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baghdad</ENAMEX> and then he was rescued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Army</ENAMEX> ground troops who were in the area .
The pilot , whose name has not been released , was brought back to this base .
He is in good condition with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the 172nd Fire Squadron</ENAMEX> which is based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Battle Creek</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Michigan</ENAMEX> , but he 's a very lucky man .
He 's with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> other As flying along with him .
They , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> , were hit .
One came back to the base .
The other we have a picture of .
It landed at a base controlled by the coalition .
That particular A was hit in the right engine .
The pilot also was able to make a safe landing and neither of those pilots were hurt .
Those are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> planes hit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Another A Warthog</ENAMEX> was hit here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
That pilot was hit by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> missile and some artillery .
We have video of that plane .
That plane has a roll in one of the engines .
Stabilizer in the back of the plane .
The pilot lost all flight control as she was flying back .
Thinking about ejecting .
Decided she could make it back safely .
She came back to this base near the border of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and it 's being described as an heroic landing after she was struck by artillery missiles .
Course , we just heard from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jamie McIntyre</ENAMEX> about <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the F E Strike Eagle</ENAMEX> .
