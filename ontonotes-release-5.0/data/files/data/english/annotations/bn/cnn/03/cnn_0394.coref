Bringing you up to date on a breaking story out of the Middle East .
In <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gaza</COREF> , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">a pair of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Israeli gun ship attack</COREF> , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">aerial attacks</COREF> that *T*-1 have threatened *PRO*-2 to derail <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the road map to peace , as <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is called *-3 *PRO*-4 *?*</COREF></COREF> .
In <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the first attack</COREF> , a car carrying <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rantissi</COREF> , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a senior member of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Hamas group</COREF> , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a militant organization</COREF></COREF></COREF> , was targeted *-1 .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> survived , with wound , but two people were killed *-1 .
27 others were injured *-1 in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">that attack</COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">The second attack</COREF> occurred after some rocket firings aimed * , apparently , toward the Israelis , apparently in retaliation .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're checking <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> facts on <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">that one</COREF> .
That is just unfolding .
The White House saying *RNR*-2 , and <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the President</COREF> directly quoted *-1 as *PRO*-1 saying *RNR*-2 , 0 <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was deeply troubled *-3 by <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">that initial attack</COREF> .
Still no reaction to <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the second attack</COREF> .
The details on <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> still inconclusive .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">The President , quoted * by <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ari Fleischer</COREF> , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> spokesman</COREF></COREF> , is saying 0 <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's concerned 0 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the strike</COREF> will undermine efforts *ICH*-1 by Palestinian authorities *PRO* to bring an end to terrorist attacks and does not contribute to the security of <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> .
Clearly some frustration with the Sharon government in <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> in the wake of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">these attacks in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Gaza</COREF></COREF> .
