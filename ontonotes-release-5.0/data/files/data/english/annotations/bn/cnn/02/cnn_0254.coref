<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are watching activity in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Baghdad</COREF> .
While <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to tell you 0 Marines battling for control of the bridges in the southern city of Nasiriyah face stiff resistance from Iraqi paramilitary groups today .
For some perspective , *PRO* let <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> turn to Miles O'Brien with retired Air Force General Don Shepperd .
*PRO* Thank you very much .
If you are going *-1 to fight on the ground , you have *-2 to encounter bridges somewhere along the way .
A lot of bridges between where <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the 3 7 Cavalry and the rest of the U.S. forces</COREF> are now *T*-1 and <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ultimate destination</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">downtown Baghdad</COREF></COREF> .
We have <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the city laid * out for you here</COREF> .
How many bridges *T*-1 in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">this city alone</COREF> ?
In this map 0 we have *T*-1 right here , 13 major bridges in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">downtown Baghdad</COREF> , including the expressway bridge over here .
Three bridges here attaching East Baghdad to West Baghdad and the palace area .
This is <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">one technique</COREF> , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one possible way 0 U.S. forces might seize <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a bridge</COREF> , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a bridge that *T*-2 might be defended *-3 by Iraqis</COREF> *T*-1</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* Let 's look at the animation .
Typical scenario there .
It does n't really matter for <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">this scenario that we 're laying *T*-1 out here</COREF> .
This would be representing M1 - A1 tanks coming towards <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the bridge</COREF> *PRO*-1 firing .
You have *-1 to bundle up and line up *PRO*-1 to go across <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">that bridge</COREF> .
*PRO* Makes <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> vulnerable to fire from the other side .
Potentially chemical weapons , too .
As we turn the other direction , what you 'll see *T*-1 are <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">these Iraqi tanks that *T*-2 are kind of fortified there</COREF> .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have burns in front of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , artillery behind <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> firing back .
And then they there goes <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the smoke screen</COREF> .
The idea of <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the smoke screen</COREF> is *PRO* to obscure <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the oncoming forces firing at you</COREF> from *PRO*-1 being able *PRO*-2 to see .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> does n't work , though .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> works both ways .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> obscures you but also obscures <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Here 's <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">an f</COREF> .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> comes in and wants *PRO*-1 to identify <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> target and <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's got a big --
*PRO* Ca n't see through the smoke .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've got some techniques 0 <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're going *-2 to show you *T*-1 .
Somewhere near we can put down special --
