<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> negotiators are back at the bargaining table in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> , but there appears to be little confidence a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Middle East</ENAMEX> peace deal can be brokered .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Barak</ENAMEX> is calling the chances of achieving an agreement `` scant . ''
He says <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> refugees will not be given the right to return .
He is also vowing to keep <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> 's most contested holy site in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> hands .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> negotiators say those parameters are dooming the talks `` before they have even started . ''
Additional violence is adding to the pessimism .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> officials closed a main road in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Gaza Strip</ENAMEX> after an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> soldier was wounded in an explosion .
