<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">`` Vanity Fair 's '' columnist</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Daniel Fair</COREF></COREF> is here .
*PRO*-1 Quiting in the June edition , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> describes <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030508_170552.18.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the journey</COREF> .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> found evidence that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Hussein 's</COREF> day of reckoning well overdue .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Christopher Hitchens</COREF> joins <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> from California .
Good *PRO* to have <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> with <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
Thanks for *PRO* having <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
<COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030508_170552.18.mrg-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Your</COREF> journey</COREF> , particularly to <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">southern Iraq</COREF> , what *T*-1 is evoked *-3 there a sense of both that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> evoke *T*-2 is a sense of history of this regime .
*PRO* Give <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> insights as to what <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 the future holds *T*-1 .
Do you mean if <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> start with the Past ?
Not at you will .
Not at all .
Not much of a trip .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was n't up the sharp end .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was n't taking risks .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was n't in a position that <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> dear friend</COREF> was in *T*-1 when <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was killed *-2 outside Bagdad airport *T*-3 but <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had long thought and <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was in <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> in the previous war that really all the talk that *T*-4 had been about the rush to war , the push for war , the drive for war , all that propaganda , was essentially nonsensical because in 1990 , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> made the only self criticism .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could either invade Kuwait or finish developing <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the nuclear weapon</COREF> .
Maybe before <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the weapon</COREF> and then later <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said , Oh , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> should have <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">got</COREF> <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the nuclear weapon</COREF> before <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> invaded .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was right about <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , but <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> means that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> inaugurated at that point <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">like a dozen - years war where <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> could be criticized *-1 for *PRO* doing too little and acting too slowly *T*-2</COREF> but all 0 we 're arguing about *T*-3 lately is *-8 to do with those that *T*-4 should have been finished *-5 in `91 when <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could have been finished *-7 *T*-6 .
*PRO* Should have taken the side of the rebels then , taken the risk of *PRO* supporting a Shiite insurrection at that point , *PRO* helping <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the Kurds</COREF> , *PRO* removing the regime .
Absolutely .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'd <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> 11 years into nation building by now if <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'd done that .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> seems *-1 to be the core of the argument .
As <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> point out *?* , of course , for the fact of the matter is , 0 the mistakes of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> made possible <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> removal from power ultimately .
The mistakes of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> , again , as <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> point out *?* , <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Norman Schwarzkopf</COREF> making a peace , permitting helicopters to fly .
*PRO* *ICH*-1 Still hurts <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *PRO* to read this .
The little town 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was in *T*-1 this <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">southern Iraq</COREF> , as far as <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> got *?* , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't boast of further , is where <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">the talks</COREF> took place *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have the transcript of <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">the meeting</COREF> .
<COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> say , Okay , <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have lost this round , Do <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> mind if <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">keep</COREF> <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">your helicopters</COREF> in the air *PRO*-1 just to be able *PRO*-2 to transport things ? and <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says , Yeah , <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> all right .
<COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> ask again , Are <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> sure 0 they mean <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> ca n't believe the luck .
<COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> use <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the gunships</COREF> *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">kill</COREF> , we think , not less than 50,000 inhabitants of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">southern Iraq</COREF> and trying *PRO* to do <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> to <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the Kurds</COREF> , as well , so it was a knife edge .
And it *EXP*-1 's not just being wise after the event , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe 0 *?* , *PRO* to say that there was an argument in realtime between the Bush administration members .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Cheney</COREF> 's the only one 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know *T*-1 that *T*-2 changed <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mind .
Most of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">those that *T*-1 took the view at that time</COREF> , think until recently 0 <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were correct in *PRO* saving <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> .
Of course , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Cheney</COREF> was in the chain of command with <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Swartzkopf</COREF> and --
Many others .
When they made the decision *PRO* not to move toward Bagdad with bad information , namely , the Republican Guard absolutely devastated * *T*-1 .
Yes .
And , well , we know now the harvest of all that .
It *EXP*-1 hurts *PRO* to think of how many wonderful people in <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> at the academic community , lawyers , human rights activists , civilians , intellectuals , people *ICH*-3 -- *T*-2 would now be alive , who *T*-4 have been horribly murdered *-5 and tortured *-5 and reduced *-5 to misery since by a half application of violence through sanctions and overflights .
Mistakes made *-1 then , mistakes part of human experience , but now we have an opportunity *PRO* not to make mistakes .
Is it *EXP*-1 your sense that <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> is on the right track ? that there is the prospect here a commitment here on the part of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> to --
