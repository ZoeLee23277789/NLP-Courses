The travel rush is not the only thing 0 some airline passengers are complaining about *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Some</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> feel worse *ICH*-1 after *PRO* flying than <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did before , but is `` bad air '' *PRO* to blame *-2 ?
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Jim Morelli</COREF> takes a look .
*PRO* Ask <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">passengers</COREF> what <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think *T*-1 of the air 0 <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're breathing *T*-2 aboard a plane , and you may get answers similar to these .
I do n't think 0 it 's a safe or healthy quality of air .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's of low quality , because <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's been recirculated and recirculated *-1 .
Very frequent complaint .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> call us , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have a little fever , perhaps , sinus congestion cold .
There is a pervasive belief that the air on planes <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> teaming with dangerous microorganisms , but <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> has never been scientifically proven *-1 .
In fact , it *EXP*-1 is possible that the air in your own home could be dirtier than what you 're breathing *T*-2 on the plane .
Possible because the fresh air pulled * in during flight may be less polluted than the air closer to the ground , and though <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">a portion of the air on planes</COREF> is recirculated *-1 , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> must pass through <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">very restrictive filters</COREF> .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> are called *-1 *PRO*-2 high - efficiency particulate air filters .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">These filters</COREF> screen out <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">very , very , very fine particles</COREF> .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Particles such as viruses , bacteria and pollen .</COREF>
But *PRO* powerful as <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">those filters</COREF> are *?* , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ca n't remedy everything .
There is no air system in the world that *T*-1 is going *-2 to protect you from the person sitting next to you .
It 's a law of physics ...
Which *T*-1 means that the only man on the pl if your seat or flu , as this tissue will sit next to you .
*PRO* Thank goodness for Kleenex tissues .
There 's a fair chance 0 you might come down with it , too .
And the air on planes may be getting dirtier .
With so many people flying these days a recent review of <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">cabin air studies called for * by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention</COREF> , found <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the research</COREF> scientifically limited and recommended 0 <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> be considered *-1 tentative .
So what 's a passenger *PRO* to do *T*-1 ?
You get rest .
You keep hydrated .
You eat well , get a flu shot , and you wash your hands .
