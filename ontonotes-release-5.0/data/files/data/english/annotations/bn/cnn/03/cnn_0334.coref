<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll continue *-1 to watch this drama unfold off Key Largo in Florida .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> move on to another important story .
It *ICH*-2 's happened , of course , several times during the war in Iraq , journalists caught *-1 in the line of fire and killed *-1 .
Israeli troops are facing a similar situation with two journalists <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030506_160524.18.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">killed</COREF> *-1 in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">just the past two weeks</COREF> .
Here 's *T*-1 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">CNN 's</COREF> Cly Wallace .
Reporter :
Friday night in the Gaza Strip and <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">a journalist</COREF> is about *-1 to lose <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life .
Shortly after several shots are heard *-1 an Israeli bulldozer can be seen *-2 uncovering the Israelis say *?* , a tunnel used * *PRO* to smuggle weapons .
Moments later , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">three journalists who *T*-1 were covering that Israeli action *ICH*-2</COREF> appear , one with TV labeled * on the back of a bullet - proof vest , another carrying a white flag .
*PRO* Judging from the videotape , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> appear *-3 difficult 0 *PRO* to see *T*-1 in the darkness , and difficult 0 *PRO* to hear *T*-2 .
After <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the journalists</COREF> shout , another gunshot .
Moments later , another shot and the sound of someone in pain .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">34 - year - old British journalist James Miller</COREF> died on the scene after Israeli soldiers came to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> aid , the Israeli defense sources says 0 *?* .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is best known for <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> work on two award - winning documentaries which *T*-1 appeared on <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> *PRO*-2 exposing the world to the Taliban rule in Afghanistan .
Now the Foreign Press Association in <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> is calling for an independent investigation .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">James</COREF> was not shooting and <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was not with somebody shooting .
So , again , *PRO*-2 to know exactly what *T*-1 happened we need a full - fledged inquiry .
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">The Israeli government</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030506_160524.18.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> forces</COREF> were returning fire and that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Miller</COREF> was shot *-1 in the back , *PRO* suggesting 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could have been hit *-2 by Palestinian gunmen .
Those close to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Miller</COREF> believe 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was shot *-1 by an armored Israeli personnel carrier .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030506_160524.18.mrg-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the Israelis</COREF> fired .
Whether or not <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was shot *-1 by Israelis ' gunfire , <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are not certain *T*-2 at this time .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Miller</COREF> becomes the second journalist in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">just two weeks</COREF> 0 *T*-1 to be killed *-2 *PRO* covering <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the Israeli - Palestinian conflict</COREF> , with Palestinian cameramen , shot and killed * by an Israeli soldier on the West Bank in mid-April .
With <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030506_160524.18.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">back - to - back deaths</COREF> making <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030506_160524.18.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">a total of at least seven journalists killed * *PRO* covering <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the conflict</COREF> in the past two and a half years</COREF> .
<COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030506_160524.18.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is very worrying and I believe 0 the Israeli Army should take special measures 0 *T*-1 to prevent this .
The message from <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the Israeli government</COREF> is that <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> soldiers are not targeting journalists , but that <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">journalists who *T*-1 travel to places where there could be live fire exchange between Israeli forces and Palestinian gunmen *T*-2</COREF> have a responsibility *PRO* to take greater precautions .
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have *-1 to realize that <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is not a game going on there .
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a life and death situation .
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Soldiers</COREF> are basically thinking about <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own lives at that moment .
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do n't have time 0 *PRO* to hesitate *T*-1 .
The Israeli spokesman says 0 the soldier has no choice , but *PRO* to be there .
