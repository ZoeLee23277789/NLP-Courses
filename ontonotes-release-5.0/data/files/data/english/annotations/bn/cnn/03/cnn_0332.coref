<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have an update *ICH*-1 now on <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">a dramatic story that people everywhere around the world are talking about *T*-2</COREF> .
Last week <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> told you about <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Aaron Ralston</COREF> , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the 27 - year - old outdoorsman who *T*-1 amputated <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own arm</COREF> with <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030505_163509.22.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">a pocket knife</COREF> after *PRO* spending five days *PRO*-2 pinned *-3 by <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030505_163509.22.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">a boulder</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
For the first time <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're hearing from <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> parents</COREF> and <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're sharing some thoughts about what <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> told <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-1 about <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this amazing ordeal</COREF> .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Arthel Neville</COREF> is joining <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> from <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the CNN newsroom in Atlanta</COREF> with details .
First of all , if <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could update you on <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Aaron 's</COREF> progress .
Over the weekend <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was upgraded *-1 to fair condition and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to have surgery today *PRO* to prepare what *T*-4 remains of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> arm</COREF> for a prosthetic .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> ordeal</COREF> started a week ago Saturday when <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was claim climbing in remote canyons in Utah alone *T*-1 .
When <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> put <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> arm</COREF> into a crack in the canyon wall *T*-1 , <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030505_163509.22.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">an 800 pound boulder</COREF> shifted , *PRO*-2 pinning <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> right there .
Now three days later <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> water ran out and on the fifth day <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made the unimaginable decision *PRO* to amputate <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> arm</COREF> below the elbow with <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030505_163509.22.mrg-E4" TYPE="IDENT">a pocket knife</COREF> .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> applied a turn *PRO* to get to keep from *PRO* bleeding to death .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> climbed back down to the canyon floor and hiked five miles before <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was found *-1 .
Then <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Aaron</COREF> was airlifted *-1 to a hospital where <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was able *PRO*-2 to walk in on <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own *T*-3 .
Now less than an hour ago , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> parents</COREF> spoke with reporters in Grand Junction , <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Colorado</COREF> , where <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is being treated *-2 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Aaron</COREF> mentioned that as <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> got near the destination the night before <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> trek , that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> realized 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had n't left word and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> actually thought about *PRO* making that call and thought 0 it was too late .
Immediately when <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> boss called *PRO*-1 to say 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had not reported for work *T*-2 , immediately <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> knew 0 something really , really bad was wrong .
It was n't until just a few minutes after 3:00 on Thursday afternoon when the call *ICH*-1 came back again that they had found <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was alive *T*-2 and all 0 <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could say *T*-3 was *PRO* Thank God , and from there you all know pretty much what *T*-4 happened .
By the way <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was n't <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Aron 's</COREF> first brush with death .
This year <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and two friends survived an avalanche in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Colorado</COREF> , but if you think 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's done , well <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's not *?* .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's trying *PRO*-1 to become first person 0 *T*-2 to <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">climb</COREF> all the <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Colorado</COREF> mountains higher than 14,000 feet , and , Wolf , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wants *PRO*-3 to do <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> alone .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Arthel Neville</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is an amazing story .
