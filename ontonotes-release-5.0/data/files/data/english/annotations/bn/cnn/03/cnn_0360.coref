*PRO* Let <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> talk a little bit more about what <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy</COREF> does *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to prevent such tragedies .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> were talking about it this morning and <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> put together some graphics for you .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll try *PRO*-1 to explain it the best 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can *?* *T*-2 from what <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> remember *T*-3 from *PRO* being on the `` USS Abraham Lincoln '' .
This is an amphibious ship , rather , but this is what <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy</COREF> does *T*-1 with regard to prevention .
Everybody that *T*-1 is , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">every sailor that *T*-2 's entering <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy</COREF></COREF> does take <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">a swim test</COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> learn how *PRO* to tread water and do the dead man float *T*-1 and <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-2 to pass <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> in order *PRO* to continue on .
Also drills take place before <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">sailors</COREF> get on to any ship , before any deployment .
Usually twice a day , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're practicing <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">man overboard drills , *PRO* knowing where *PRO*-5 to go *T*-1 , where *PRO*-5 to report to *T*-2 if indeed a man overboard takes place</COREF> and as the deployment begins , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> wane off , but <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know where *PRO*-4 to go *T*-3 quickly .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also wear <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">float coats</COREF> .
You can see <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> here .
The yellow shirt is wearing a yellow float coat .
Everything is color coordinated .
You see the gentleman here wearing a brown one and <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">toggles 0 *PRO*-2 to pull *T*-1 and inflate</COREF> .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also have a manual device so if <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the toggles</COREF> do n't work <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can blow air into the inflation device .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">dive goggles</COREF> and <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're able *PRO*-1 to find <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
It also has a strobe light and a whistle .
Also such location devices , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">some ships</COREF> have smoke floats 0 <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can toss *T*-1 out so <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the man overboard</COREF> will be able *PRO*-2 to use smoke signals as a way of *PRO* trying *PRO*-3 to find or locate , let the rescuer locate <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Also 24 / 7 there are individuals on watch , all throughout <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> , all around <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> , and indeed , there is netting on most parts of <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> , not on entire all around <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the entire ship</COREF> , but on most parts there is a very thick netting *T*-1 .
Now *PRO* let <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> talk about the man overboard rescue and when indeed there is a man overboard situation *T*-1 .
You will hear a P.A. announcement *ICH*-1 around <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the entire ship</COREF> , there is <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">a man overboard</COREF> so <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">everyone</COREF> knows 0 <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-2 to react quickly .
A ship - wide search will happen if <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't see <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">that person</COREF> go overboard , but if indeed <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do see someone go overboard , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> starts *-1 to circle that area continuously .
Also small boats sometimes go out into the water , but even more importantly , <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">helicopters</COREF> are launched *-1 immediately .
Inside <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">those helicopters</COREF> <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">rescue swimmers</COREF> .
If indeed <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the man overboard</COREF> is located *-1 , well the hoister is dropped *-2 down with <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">usually a torso harness</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the man overboard</COREF> is injured *-1 then they may use a basket , but more than likely <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">those swimmers</COREF> will go right into the water and try and help <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the swimmer</COREF> hook up on <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">that harness</COREF> and pull <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> up into the helo and pull <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> back on to <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> for treatment and usually <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">a search</COREF> takes about 24 hours .
The search crews will go 24 hours before *PRO* calling off <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">that search</COREF> .
Why *PRO* call <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> off *T*-1 ?
There 's a number of reasons 0 *PRO* to look at *T*-1 .
Depending on the water temperature , it 's very possible that or very common in cold water that someone will not survive a certain amount of time .
Also the reason for the 24 - hour search is 0 <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> fail <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've exhausted all resources by that time .
Anyway , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll continue *-1 to follow what *T*-2 's happening on the `` USS Nassau '' as those investigations *ICH*-3 continue for the two missing sailors .
