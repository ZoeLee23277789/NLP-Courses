For <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">some Americans who *T*-1 find <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> spending hours on end *PRO*-2 watching television coverage of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF></COREF> , it *EXP*-3 can <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> hard *PRO* to break away .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is especially true if you have a loved one in the war zone , but as <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030327_163556.20.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> Candy Crowley reminds us *?* , life does and must go on .
Reporter :
Spring - time and a game of catch on the Washington Mall .
A gentle breeze and a good meal beside the Pacific Ocean .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">That other place</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the one on TV all the time</COREF> , might as well <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> on another planet , and <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> may be the point .
We happen *-1 to be at a very nice spot by the beach where this is a chance for people to get away from <COREF ID="CNN_ENG_20030327_163556.20.mrg-E3" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> coverage , everything , and kind of relax *T*-2 .
Reporter :
Time 0 *PRO* to redefine normal *ICH*-2 again *T*-1 , which *T*-3 on <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the homefront</COREF> now seems *-4 to mean <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">life as you live <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> only weirder</COREF> .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm amazed at how unaffected *ICH*-2 <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am *T*-1 by things , how <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm still coming to work and doing the same things and going for a walk in the morning *T*-3 , and it just seems *-4 so strange to <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> that it 's almost a parallel universe .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">More than 70 percent of Americans</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are sad about <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> .
The barber at Hinsville Georgia larries that .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> seem *-1 more depressed .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">A lot of <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> afraid 0 <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going *-1 to lose <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> jobs , you know , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> is down and all kind of stuff .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Life on <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the homefront</COREF></COREF> seems *-1 the same at Farmer 's Market in Los Angeles , but <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's more angst ridden .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's affecting our business as much as <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was worried that <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would *?* , but you never know 0 it 's going *-1 to happen .
If there 's <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">any kind of terrorism that *T*-1 happens here</COREF> , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would definitely put a damper on everything .
Nationwide , people shopped less in the first week of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> .
Sales fell 2 percent from the previous week .
Air travel has fallen 10 mers since <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> began and some hotel chains say 0 cancellations are up .
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">60 percent of the people</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're watching <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">My boyfriend</COREF> has been watching <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the TV</COREF> like every single day , every time 0 <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> comes on *T*-1 , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's watching <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Maybe <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">fewer people</COREF> are shopping because <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're watching TV .
Maybe <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">fewer</COREF> are flying because <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> worry about terrorism or <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> worry about what <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> will do *T*-1 to <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> or maybe it 's everything .
There 's no one economic statistics 0 *T*-1 to point to a downturn , it 's <COREF ID="147" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">an overall feeling</COREF> , <COREF ID="147" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a psychological feeling that everything is frozen , everything is on hold</COREF> .
