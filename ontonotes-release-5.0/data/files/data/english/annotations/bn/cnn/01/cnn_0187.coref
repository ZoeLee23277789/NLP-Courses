A shift of winds is pushing <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">an oil spill</COREF> away from <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Galapagos Islands</COREF> and into the open sea , but the cleanup is far from over , as <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Robert Moore</COREF> reports *?* .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador 's</COREF> declaration of a state of emergencies around <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Galapagos Islands</COREF> is a sign of how serious <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the oil spil</COREF> is now judged *-1 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> may not be a large tanker by international standards , but this is a uniquely fragile and precious marine environment .
Experts examining <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the wreck</COREF> are still concentrating on *PRO* <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">transferring</COREF> to safe storage <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the oil and fuel that *T*-1 remains on board</COREF> , and the U.S. Coast Guard are helping in <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">this operation</COREF> , but <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador 's</COREF> Environment Minister describes <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the ship 's</COREF> condition as critical with <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">gallons of oil</COREF> still on <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the ship</COREF> .
Some of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">that fuel</COREF> will evaporate but the currents are moving <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the spill</COREF> toward a large number of other islands in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the chain</COREF> .
Worsening weather could also be a factor in the coming days .
The smells are getting worse out there .
We hear 0 there is a big -- there 's a gale up north that *T*-1 's going *-2 to create a big swell by Wednesday .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The Galapagos Isles</COREF> lie 600 miles off <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Ecuador 's</COREF> pacific coast , *PRO*-1 populated *-2 by animal and plant species found * nowhere else .

The reality of an oil spill here has led to environmental organizations calling for greater control of shipping in the area .
