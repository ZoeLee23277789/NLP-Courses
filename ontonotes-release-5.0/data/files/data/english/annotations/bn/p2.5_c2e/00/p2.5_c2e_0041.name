At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">7:00AM</ENAMEX> of local time on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00PM</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> time on the same day , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USA</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Iraq Study Group</ENAMEX> submitted to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> a policy report on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> which has been brewing for as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> .
According to this report , it suggested that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> conduct a staged withdrawal of troops from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and requests that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> hold direct dialogues with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Early in the morning</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> , the members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Iraq Study Group</ENAMEX> arrived at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the White House</ENAMEX> and intended to submit the policy report on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> to President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> .
According to the report of the Associated Press , this report appeals to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the US government</ENAMEX> to adjust its policy on Iraq and suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> forces gradually hand security control over to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> military , then finally withdraw from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early 2008</ENAMEX> .
At the same time , the report also suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> open direct dialogue with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> , which have a certain amount of influence on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , and jointly resolve the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> problem .
Due to the ever - increasing frequency of violent activity in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> recently , the number of casualties among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> troops stationed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> has steadily climbed up and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Republican Party</ENAMEX> where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> is had a defeat in midterm elections in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early November</ENAMEX> , so how the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration will actually adjust the policy on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> has become the focus of attention from all sides in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Snow</ENAMEX> points out that the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration actually does not expect too much from this report because it is not fair to have such an idea to expect that this report will provide a magic bullet for solving the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> problem .
Additionally , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> are also paying close attention to the arrival of this report .
