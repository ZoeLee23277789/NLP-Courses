Yes , although a wide range of topics will be discussed at <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">this NATO summit</ENAMEX> , general public attention will be focused on : <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> 's eastward expansion and its relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> 's strategy in expanding its functions and powers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</ENAMEX> .
Then , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">this NATO summit</ENAMEX> , eh , is being held at the doorsteps of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , in the capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Latvia</ENAMEX> , eh , er , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Riga</ENAMEX> ; this is also the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time that such a summit is being held in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Eastern European</ENAMEX> country , and that itself is provocative for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Moscow</ENAMEX> .
In order to avoid provoking <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , eh , <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the NATO summit</ENAMEX> may not directly announce the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> batch of countries covered in the eastward expansion ; but indeed , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macedonia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Albania</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Azerbaijan</ENAMEX> , er , even , eh , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ukraine</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> , which are in tense relations with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> , are all listed in the next batch of development .
And NATO hopes to work more closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asia - Pacific</ENAMEX> countries such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Australia</ENAMEX> ; and this makes it more puzzling as to how <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> is defining the scope and breadth of its future global partnership strategies .
Also , in addition to counter-terrorism and peacekeeping , eh , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> also intended to place resources and energy security , as well as computer networks protection , into its scope of responsibilities in its new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">21st century</ENAMEX> strategies .
This means that in the future , the reasons for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> 's global military actions and other excuses , eh , to intervene in situations will all substantially increase .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> 's desire and goal to move from regional to global , eh , and from passive defense to active attack is now also becoming increasingly clear and evident .
