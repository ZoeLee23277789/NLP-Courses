Let 's take another look at what comments other media have made on this session of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> party talks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Korea 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kyung Hyang Daily News</ENAMEX> says in an article that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> is basically satisfied with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> attitude , or else it would have surely turned back again and left the negotiation table of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> party talks .
Facts show that as long as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides are willing to talk , the issues will not be pigeonholed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The New York Times</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> says in an article that the most urgent task is to disarm <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> of its nuclear weapons .
However , with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea 's</ENAMEX> tough position on the financial sanctions , it is very hard for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> to discuss other issues with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> .
This is the challenge that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> delegation is facing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wen Wei Po</ENAMEX> says in an article that <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of key obstacles to the progress of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> - party talks this time is precisely the issue of financial sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> .
But the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> has still not made any concession on that .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Asahi Shimbun</ENAMEX> says in an article that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - phase meeting of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fifth</ENAMEX> round of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> - party talks has entered the stage of substantive discussion and that the entire talk centering around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's proposal is gradually coming to an end .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> said today that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> have already touched upon many substantive issues .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kim Kye - gwan</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> that if the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> attempts to use both hard and soft tactics such as coupling dialogue with pressure and carrots with sticks in negotiations , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> will surely counteract with dialogue and a shield .
But the trend of the talks has been positive .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Xinhua News Agency</ENAMEX> article said that the talks will enter the stage of documenting the progress in written form .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hill</ENAMEX> noted that it was really not an easy job to resume the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> - party talks .
He did not want to predict whether the talks would be successful , saying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> still thinks that the financial sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> should be separated from the issue of a nuclear - free <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Korean Peninsula</ENAMEX> .
