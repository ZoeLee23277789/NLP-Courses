In view of the important characteristics of warfare in a modern information rich environment , a training base in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Lanzhou Military Command</ENAMEX> has taken care to create a complex electromagnetic environment when organizing army exercises , in order to improve through training the military 's ability to win battles in an information - rich environment .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> recently organized exercise , to create the electromagnetic environment for the blue force 's command and communication system , they used the method which combines real and simulated set - up , aerial and land - based , fixed and tracking , and real and fake measures .
Using advanced electronic information technology and simulation technology , they produced things like mimic radar communication vehicles and mimic satellites communication vehicles that simulate electromagnetic properties .
They placed actual objects inside the blue force 's positions to mimic the electromagnetic environment that various kinds of weaponry would create during a battle .
Through the combined operation of many techniques , they chiefly worked to create a relatively complex electromagnetic battlefield for the army .
Against a complex electromagnetic environment and countermeasures , they guided the army to carry out exercises in electronic reconnaissance and anti-reconnaissance , jamming and anti-jamming , suppression and anti-suppression actions and other operations .
This effectively trained and improved the army 's ability to carry out multiple combat operations in an information - rich environment .
