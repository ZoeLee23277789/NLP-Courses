Given <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> 's refusal to suspend its uranium enrichment activities , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> countries -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> -- with the support of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , circulated a draft resolution on sanctions against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the UN Security Council</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">8th</ENAMEX> , in which , it suggested a sanction against the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> suspected of involvement in the nuclear program .
However , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Washington Post</ENAMEX> report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">11th</ENAMEX> , the list of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranians</ENAMEX> provided by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. State Department</ENAMEX> was actually obtained from an Internet search .
Even the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">U.S. Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> had doubts about its accuracy .
According to insider sources cited by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Washington Post</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> felt that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S</ENAMEX> . had committed major mistakes in its intelligence provided to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the UN Security Council</ENAMEX> prior to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Iraq War</ENAMEX> , hence they could not afford to make another mistake on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> issue , and therefore refused to provide the list to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State Department</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The State Department</ENAMEX> had no choice but to assign a junior official to search for the names online .
After entering a few keywords , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> nuclear program and others , this official selected <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> names with the highest hit rate , and finally wrote them into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Security Council</ENAMEX> draft resolution .
The draft clearly pointed out that these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> people ought to be sanctioned , including placing a ban on their international travels and participation in international business activities .
According to reports , related <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CIA</ENAMEX> officials said none of the people mentioned on the list were directly related to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> 's secret nuclear program .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. State Department</ENAMEX> still included this list obtained from an Internet search in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UN Security Council</ENAMEX> draft resolution submitted by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> .
This will greatly weaken the persuasiveness of the draft .
