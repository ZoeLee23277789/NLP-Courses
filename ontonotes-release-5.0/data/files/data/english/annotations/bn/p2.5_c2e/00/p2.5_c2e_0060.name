<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U. N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention</ENAMEX> twice reached unanimity regarding the issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's trial .
The conclusion was that the forcible deprivation of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's liberty contravened the provisions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</ENAMEX> .
The covenant is a binding international treaty of which both the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> are signatory states .
The statements said that the opinion issued by the working group on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1 of this year</ENAMEX> concretely set out many procedural shortcomings in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's trial .
These included the lack of independence and impartiality of the tribunal , the insufficient time and facilities <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> had to prepare his defense , the restrictions on his right to access lawyers , also the restrictions on the possibilitly of defense lawyers in calling and interrogating witnesses , and so on .
This working group also emphasized that in issuing the statement it was not requesting the release of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> , but rather was recommending that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , in accordance with the relevant international covenants , reexamine whether at the outset <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> 's trial conformed to regulations .
Besides <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</ENAMEX> , these covenants also include <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Universal Declaration of Human Rights</ENAMEX> .
The working group also called on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Iraqi government</ENAMEX> to refrain from carrying out the sentence of death by hanging on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> until it had reexamined the trial procedures .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> is accused of carrying out a reprisal operation against local villagers and killing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">143</ENAMEX> people in the local area in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</ENAMEX> after escaping an assassination in the village of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dujail</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 5th of this month</ENAMEX> , he was sentenced to death by hanging by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Iraqi High Tribunal</ENAMEX> .
Even though <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saddam</ENAMEX> still has the right to appeal to the appellate court , once the sentence has been determined it must be carried out within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">thirty days</ENAMEX> .
