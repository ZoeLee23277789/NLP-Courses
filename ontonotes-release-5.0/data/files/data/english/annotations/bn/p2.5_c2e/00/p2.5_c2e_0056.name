The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North Korean</ENAMEX> financial working group has ended its second session of discussions on the issue of financial sanctions .
For the most recent details , we will now connect to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Phoenix Satellite TV 's</ENAMEX> reporter in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qin Feng</ENAMEX> .
Hello , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Qin Feng</ENAMEX> .
What was the main topic of discussion for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North Korean</ENAMEX> finance working group <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> ?
And what results were achieved ?
Yes , Anchorman .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">The third day</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Six Party Talks</ENAMEX> has also ended .
What all sides were focusing on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , eh , was still the bilateral discussions between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> on the issue of financial sanctions .
This morning at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">ten o'clock</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> sides of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> met at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North Korean</ENAMEX> embassy in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Beijing</ENAMEX> .
And the meeting lasted ten <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">five hours</ENAMEX> , ending at around <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">three that afternoon</ENAMEX> .
Regarding the content of the talks , eh , we speculate , eh , that it was probably on a few particular issues , including among them <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea 's</ENAMEX> demand that the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> end the freeze on its assets in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Banco Delta Asia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> .
Besides this , eh , it also wants an end to the freeze on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> assets of eight <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">North Korean</ENAMEX> companies .
Will the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> agree or concede to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea 's</ENAMEX> demands ?
We still have no idea about this , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> could possibly acknowledge that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">twelve million US dollars</ENAMEX> out of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">twenty - four million US dollars</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Banco Delta Asia</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Macao</ENAMEX> are legal and do not involve money laundering , weapons proliferation or counterfeiting .
