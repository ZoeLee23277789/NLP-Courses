A while ago we talked about the dispute that arose between <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> overseas students from mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and their college because they were not satisfied with the education and the refund procedures at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toronto Polytechnic Institute</ENAMEX> .
In fact , ah , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> overseas students being cheated in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> is not accidental .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of this year</ENAMEX> , uh , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ontario Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> revoked the licenses of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> private schools on the grounds of being found to have been falsifying and raising students ' grades at will .
As a result , the admission qualifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> overseas students who have ever studied at these schools have been revoked .
Recently , uh , it has been again reported in the news that at another private college the students were unable to receive their degree certificates after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> of study .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Global Chinese Press</ENAMEX> has published an editorial on this series of events , saying why <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> overseas students in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> repeatedly get cheated .
In the editorial , uh , it says there are several reasons .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> is , uh , that not enough attention is paid to the pre-warnings issued by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chinese Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> for studying abroad .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> is that some overseas students and parents lack a rational attitude , stepping onto the risky springboard , even when they know fully well that the schools have problems , but in order to get a visa and quickly emigrate .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Third</ENAMEX> , uh , is that the information for studying abroad has false and exaggerated elements that seriously mislead students .
What is worth noting is , uh , that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> versions of the webpages of many private schools are not the same .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> versions are relatively a little more honest , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> versions are given to exaggeration .
Here , ah , we want to give a reminder to those students with dreams of studying abroad : you must think very carefully before you choose your school .
