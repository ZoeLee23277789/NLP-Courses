<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The US Iraq Study Group 's</ENAMEX> report on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">6th</ENAMEX> made <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">79</ENAMEX> recommendations to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bush administration</ENAMEX> on its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> policy .
There are <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> key recommendations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> is to urge <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bush administration</ENAMEX> to launch a new diplomatic offensive in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> and Gulf , in particular , to hold talks with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Syria</ENAMEX> on the resolution to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> sectarian conflicts .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> is to change the primary tasks of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> and gradually withdraw the military from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> if conditions permit .
This study report says the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> is very grave and deteriorating .
However , it is very careful in wording when making proposals and appears ambiguous at critical points .
For example , the report even just briefly touches on military withdrawal , an issue of the most concern .
If nothing unexpected will have happened in the security situation by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 2008</ENAMEX> , the primary task of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> military in Iraq should be shifted to supporting the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> military that assumes main military operations .
All the unnecessary combat troops will leave <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
Some analyses think that this shows , on one hand , that the study group did not want to confront <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bush administration</ENAMEX> on this key and sensitive issue of military withdrawal , and on the other hand , it also shows that amidst the current mess in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , both <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republicans</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democrats</ENAMEX> find it very hard to come up with an effective and sure - fire proposal and action plan .
So , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqis</ENAMEX> think this report is rather of little practical significance .
