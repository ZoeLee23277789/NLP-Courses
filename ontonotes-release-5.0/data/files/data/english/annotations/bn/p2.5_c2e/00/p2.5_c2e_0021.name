We not only need to carefully protect books and literature , but also should ensure that the natural environment is not destroyed .
In the natural world , colorful butterflies with lithe profiles have , since ancient times , been the theme for many writers and poets who had created many works with various styles .
But when it comes to using real butterflies as material , have you ever seen artistic expressions on paintings using butterflies ' wings ?
Recently , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> butterfly artist Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Zequan</ENAMEX> brought his paintings of butterfly wings to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Toronto</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> , and displayed pieces of his unique works to the local community .
Let us enjoy them through the lenses of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Canadian City Television</ENAMEX> .
This piece titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Longing</ENAMEX> uses a style which combines the abstract and the real , as described by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> .
The abstract was assisted through a painting which depicts the feelings of longing of the person in the picture , and the actual images made use of various butterfly wings to manifest the beautiful costumes of the young lady .
For instance , the white shawl of the young lady was put together using common cabbage white butterflies .
