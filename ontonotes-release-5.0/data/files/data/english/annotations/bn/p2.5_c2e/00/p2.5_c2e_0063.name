Regarding the progress of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> nuclear issue , uh , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Korean Central News Agency</ENAMEX> released an editorial <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
In this editorial , it mentioned , uh , saying that the entire international community is earnestly anticipating that <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the six party talks</ENAMEX> could resume .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> is the only exception .
Among these , uh , it also accused , saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> intended to sabotage <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the six party talks</ENAMEX> , so as to prevent the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> nuclear issue from being fairly resolved .
Prior to the holding of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">six party talks</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> nuclear issue , uh , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> requested that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> must abandon its nuclear program and meanwhile , must also resolve the hostage issue between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> .
This editorial believed , saying that , ah , this , uh , actually had poisoned the negotiation atmosphere of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the six - party talks</ENAMEX> .
Well , at the same time , uh , this editorial , uh , also believed , saying that the hostage issue and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> nuclear issue were in fact <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> totally unrelated issues , so it did not make any sense that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> raised this issue .
It also denounced the earlier speech , uh , by Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso , er , Japan , Japanese Prime Minister Abe , er , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taro Aso</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Taro Aso</ENAMEX> proposed at an earlier time , saying that , uh , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> would not accept <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> as a nuclear country returning to the negotiation table , meanwhile , uh , also requesting that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> must dismantle its nuclear weapons .
Well , with regard to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , uh , if it did not change its position , this editorial also said , it would then be impossible to hold <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the six - party talks</ENAMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Korea</ENAMEX> nuclear issue in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> , nor would it be possible in the future unless the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> changed its position .
