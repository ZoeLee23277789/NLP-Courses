The recently concluded <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">China - Africa Forum</ENAMEX> reminded many people of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Tanzania - Zambia Railway</ENAMEX> which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> offered support in building in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Africa</ENAMEX> .
However , people may not know that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> another group of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chinese</ENAMEX> people in a foreign land are still evoking the same kind of touching story , treating the war wounds of battle - scarred <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX> , and paving a road to prosperity .
The restoration project for <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highway 7</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kracheh</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Cambodia - Laos border</ENAMEX> is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's largest project aiding <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cambodia</ENAMEX> to date .
It is being undertaken by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shanghai Construction Group</ENAMEX> .
Previously on this <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">186 - kilometer</ENAMEX> road , the widest section was only <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four meters</ENAMEX> , while the narrowest was only <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">40 centimeters</ENAMEX> .
The road was bumpy and rough throughout , and there were landmines left from the chaos of war back then .
Since construction started on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November 18 , 2004</ENAMEX> , through the hard work of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> engineers , the width of all road sections has now been broadened to over <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">seven meters</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> layer of asphalt has been laid and pressed on most road sections , with all lanes expected to be open to traffic by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July 2007</ENAMEX> .
In order to turn this small path into a thoroughfare , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> engineering personnel have overcome a series of difficulties .
