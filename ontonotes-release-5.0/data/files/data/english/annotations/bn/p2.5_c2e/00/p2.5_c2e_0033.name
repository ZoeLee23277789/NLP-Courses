For many overseas immigrants , becoming a citizen is a matter of great concern .
And passing the citizenship examination is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the hurdles they must overcome .
Recently , ah , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</ENAMEX> has changed the format of their citizenship exams .
This decision has increased the difficulties of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> becoming <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> citizens , and has resulted in quite some repercussions among the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> community .
Let us look at a report from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Chinese</ENAMEX> - language television .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</ENAMEX> announced the questions for the new citizenship exam , there were mixed reactions within the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> communities , in particular from some of the elderly who wished to become citizens .
Some felt that it would be more difficult to become naturalized citizens from now on .
Some citizenship classes are also forced to update their existing curricula .
It is generally believed that the revised naturalization questions will increase the difficulty of the exam .
Currently , most of the questions only require simple answers to be satisfactory .
However , from the known portions of the new exam questions , future exams will assess naturalization applicants ' knowledge in areas like <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> social and political history ; and applicants need to extend and elaborate their answers .
For instance , current applicants only need to know that the structure of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the U.S. government</ENAMEX> is a separation of powers among the legislative , executive , and judicial branches , but future applicants will need to answer why there is a need for such a separation of powers .
So for those who do not have a good command of <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> , they will usually find it more difficult .
