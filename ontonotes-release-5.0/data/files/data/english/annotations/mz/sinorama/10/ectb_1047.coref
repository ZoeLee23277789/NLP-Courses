<COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">The terracotta warriors from the tomb of Qin Shi Huang , which *T*-1 is included *-1 on the list of World Heritage sites of the UNESCO</COREF> , have come ashore in <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> !

" *PRO* Reporting to the general , sir !
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">A mob of thousands</COREF> has surrounded the building ! "
<COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">A mounted warrior</COREF> delivers the dire news to <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> commander , whose high rank *T*-1 can be seen *-1 in <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> tasseled helmet and coat of mail</COREF> .
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">The " mob</COREF> , " of course , is thirsty not for blood .
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> just want a glimpse of <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the warriors</COREF> .
Although <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the warriors</COREF> may not be aware of <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> the star attraction at <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">a blockbuster exhibit</COREF> showing now at <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">the National Museum of History in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei</COREF></COREF> .
Since *PRO* opening on December 15 , <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">the exhibit</COREF> has touched off a wave of enthusiasm *ICH*-1 in <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> for <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the terracotta warriors</COREF> , and lines for admission have often snaked along the street for hundreds of meters .
Over 20,000 advance tickets have been sold *-1 , and group visits are already booked *-2 *PRO*-2 solid to the end of January .
<COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">Many schools in central and southern Taiwan</COREF> are renting buses by the dozen *PRO*-1 to ferry <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> students up to <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei</COREF> , and lots of foreign tourists are also coming by for a look .

Eighth wonder
Shaanxi Province was hit *-1 by a long drought in the summer of 1974 .
The farmer <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yang Zhifa</COREF> and a neighbor were digging a well when a shovel clinked on something hard *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yang</COREF> exclaimed , " Whoa ! It 's <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> ! "
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Locals</COREF> had talked for generations about <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the buried clay figures that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would sometimes run across *T*-1 while *PRO* digging in the fields</COREF> .
Everyone knew 0 <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were out there , but no one knew quite what <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were *T*-1 .
People figured 0 <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must have been connected *-1 with ancestral spirits of some sort .
*PRO*-2 Anxious *PRO*-2 not to run afoul of the netherworld , the farmers would always hurriedly throw dirt back over the spot and find a better place 0 *PRO* to dig *T*-1 .
This time , however , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yang Zhifa</COREF> went a step further .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> reported the incident to <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> superiors at the local commune .
It was n't long before archeologists were swarming over the site , *PRO*-1 unearthing <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-001-E4" TYPE="IDENT">an army of terracotta warriors that *T*-2 had lain *PRO*-2 buried *-2 for over 2,000 years</COREF> .
<COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-001-E4" TYPE="IDENT">The stunning discovery</COREF> was dubbed *-1 *PRO*-1 the eighth wonder of the world .
<COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-001-E4" TYPE="IDENT">The terracotta army</COREF> gives a graphic illustration of the grand scale of <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Qin Shi Huang 's</COREF> ambitions .
<COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-001-E4" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also shows how technologically advanced <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> already was *T*-1 when <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Qin Shi Huang</COREF> was buried *-2 some 2,200 years ago *T*-3 .
In order *PRO* to create the feel of an actual descent into <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the emperor 's</COREF> tomb , the museum has arranged the exhibit so that visitors enter on the second floor and descend from there into a tomb - like atmosphere on the first floor , where the dimly lit space affords a glimpse of what *T*-2 was on <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the emperor 's</COREF> mind during the years 0 <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was busily uniting <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> for the very first time in history *T*-3 *T*-1 .

The afterlife
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Qin Shi Huang</COREF> united <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> in the year 221 B.C .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> regarded <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> achievements as " *PRO* surpassing those of the Three Kings and Five Emperors of old , " and appointed <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *PRO*-1 " the first true emperor , " or Qin Shi Huang .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">*PRO*-2 <COREF ID="25" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">A believer in the possibility of immortality</COREF> , <COREF ID="25" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the emperor</COREF></COREF> once dispatched a trusted aide on a voyage across the seas *PRO* to search for magic herbs that *T*-1 would provide eternal youth .
Perhaps as " plan B , " <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> also poured vast resources into the construction of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">a burial mound equipped * with all the accoutrements that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was accustomed *-2 to *T*-1 in the here and now</COREF> .
The population of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the kingdom of Qin</COREF> at that time was about 20 million , of whom over 2 million *T*-1 were mobilized *-2 *PRO* to bring <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> grand underground palace</COREF> to completion .
Now that <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the complex</COREF> has been discovered *-1 , it is unquestionably <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the life - size terracotta warriors</COREF> and <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">horses</COREF> that *T*-2 inspire the most amazement .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">The 8,000 figures that *T*-1 have been unearthed *-1 at <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the site</COREF> in Shaanxi Province</COREF> were all executed *-2 with painstaking realism .
The rank of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">each figure</COREF> determined every little detail of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> making , right down to the type of military uniform , cap , armor , hairstyle , and beard .
Artisans even incised the soles of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the soldiers '</COREF> shoes *PRO*-1 to show the threads , and made *PRO* sure 0 <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the horses '</COREF> teeth were realistically done *-2 .
Each face is unique .
Some characters project an air of stern authority .
Others suggest a fierce and violent personality .
Still other faces clearly belong to tender , untested young greenhorns .
The tremendous individuality in <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the warriors</COREF> never fails *-1 to amaze .
Indeed , there are people who *T*-1 subscribe to the rumor that each clay figure encloses the corpse of a real person .
Careful inspection of the markings on <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the figures</COREF> reveals that about 90 " master craftsmen " participated in <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the making of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the terracotta warriors</COREF></COREF> , each supported *-1 by a team of ten or more assistants .
The total number of <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">artisans involved *</COREF> probably came to nearly a thousand .
Some of <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> were employed *-1 by imperial kilns , while others came from private establishments .
<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a huge undertaking , for each figure had *-1 to be shaped , molded , kneaded , sculpted , and painted *-1 .
Decorative relief elements had *-1 to be applied *-1 .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">The figures</COREF> had *-1 to be covered *-1 with an off - white slip *PRO* to approximate the color of skin .
The hair , too , had *-1 to be appropriately colored *-1 .
Even <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the horses</COREF> were painted *-1 in appropriate shades of reddish - brown and black .
<COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> tongues were done *-1 in pink , and <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> teeth in white .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">The soldiers</COREF> stand a surprising 180 centimeters in height , *PRO* prompting many *PRO*-1 to ask whether <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the men of that time</COREF> were actually taller than <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> modern counterparts .
There are two different theories concerning this question , says *T*-1 <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wu Yongqi</COREF> , <COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the head of the Museum of Terracotta Warriors</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO*-1 In Taipei for the exhibit , <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> explains that some say 0 it *EXP*-2 is natural that <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the figures</COREF> should be taller since people from <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> northwest - where <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the Qin kingdom</COREF> was located *-3 *T*-4 - have always been taller than other Chinese .
Others , however , theorize that <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the artisans</COREF> intentionally made <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the figures</COREF> slightly larger than life *PRO*-1 to compensate for the shrinkage that *T*-2 would take place while the freshly molded figures were drying .

The cultured side of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Qin</COREF>
But if you visit <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the exhibit</COREF> , *PRO* do n't be so dazzled *ICH*-1 by <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the terracotta figures</COREF> that you forget all about <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the exhibit 's</COREF> larger focus on <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Qin</COREF> artifacts in general .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tu Cheng - sheng</COREF> , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of the National Palace Museum</COREF> , stated after *PRO* visiting <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the exhibit</COREF> that most of our knowledge concerning <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the Qin dynasty</COREF> comes from official dynastic histories authored * during the Han period .
These later authors generally had a jaundiced view of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the Qin</COREF> , and tended *-1 to focus on the ruthless , autocratic rule of Qin Shi Huang while *PRO* paying less attention to the positive achievements of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Qin</COREF> culture , or the beauty of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Qin</COREF> handicrafts .
A round eaves - tile at <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the exhibit</COREF> features an image of <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-003-E3" TYPE="IDENT">a running deer , <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-003-E3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> stout , robust frame executed * with startling skill</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">An elderly visitor</COREF> was overheard *-1 exclaiming to <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife : " They made such beautiful tiles !
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wonder if we can even do anything that nice today ? "
Also featured *-2 at <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the exhibit</COREF> are *T*-1 two replicas of brass <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Qin</COREF> - period chariots on loan from the Taiwanese art collector Huang Jen - chung and the National Museum of Natural Science .
Each chariot is assembled *-1 from over 7,000 different pieces , and is half the size of <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-003-E5" TYPE="IDENT">the original , which *T*-2 has been described *-2 as " the most extraordinary bronze piece ever made * " on account of <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-003-E5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> huge size , complex structure , and lifelike realism</COREF> .
In addition , scholars have discovered that <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the bronze weapons unearthed * along with <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the soldiers</COREF></COREF> all have a different percentage of copper and tin , depending on <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> purpose .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Arrowheads</COREF> , with <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> requirement for hardness and ability *PRO* to penetrate armor , had a higher ratio of tin than other weapons .
And <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">a bronze sword , found * bent * out of shape from the weight of fallen clay figures sitting on <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> for two millennia</COREF> , sprang back *ICH*-1 immediately to <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> original shape once the heavy objects were removed *-2 from on top of <COREF ID="ectb_1047.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is evident that the bronze metalworkers of that time were very highly skilled .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">The exhibit</COREF> will remain in Taiwan until March 11 .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">The National Museum of History</COREF> is open from 10:00 to 18:00 on weekdays and 09:30 to 18:00 on weekends and holidays .
In order *PRO* to give <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">persons with disabilities</COREF> a chance *PRO* to view <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the exhibit</COREF> without *PRO* having * to fight the crowds , <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the museum</COREF> will provide free admission just for <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">these special guests</COREF> every Wednesday at 09:00 .
The wait for admission has sometimes taken two to three hours , but the crowds are likely *-1 to grow gradually smaller with time , so it *EXP*-2 might be a good idea *PRO* to wait a few weeks before *PRO* heading to <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the museum</COREF> .
In the meantime , you can find lots of information on <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the exhibit</COREF> , including a virtual tour , on the Internet at http://www.qin.com.tw .

Were the men of old really so tall ?

Or were the artisans simply exaggerating ?
There are many competing explanations on this score .
