<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">El Salvador</COREF> , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">ROC</COREF> diplomatic ally in Central America</COREF></COREF> , was hit *-1 on <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">January 13</COREF> by <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">an earthquake measuring between 7.4 and 7.9 on the Richter scale</COREF> .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">The earthquake</COREF> killed hundreds and left tens of thousands *PRO*-1 homeless .
As soon as reports of <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the earthquake</COREF> came in , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC government</COREF> donated US$ 200,000 *U* *PRO*-1 to support disaster relief efforts , and within 24 hours had dispatched a team *PRO*-2 to help *PRO*-2 rescue victims .
It truly does seem that " when it rains *T*-1 , it pours , " for <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">India</COREF> was then visited *-2 on January 26 by <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> biggest earthquake in 50 years , and according to official estimates the death toll may rise to over 20,000 .
Although <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF> does not have official ties with <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">India</COREF> , as Sinorama went to press on <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">January 29</COREF> rescue teams from <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> were standing by for departure , *PRO*-1 awaiting only the go - ahead from <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">India</COREF> .
Just short of noon on <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Saturday , January 13</COREF> , <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">most everyone in <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF></COREF> was at home *PRO*-1 preparing for lunch when the earth below <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> feet suddenly began *-3 to shake violently *T*-2 .
Just outside the capital of San Salvador , a hillside collapsed in the community of Las Colinas , *PRO*-1 burying more than 260 homes and 1,200 residents .
As of <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">January 29</COREF> , the confirmed toll from <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the earthquake</COREF> stood at 726 dead and 4,440 injured * , with 120,000 homes either totally or partially destroyed * and more than 980,000 left * homeless .
Over 600 aftershocks have hit <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> since <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">January 13</COREF> .
The difficulty of emergency rescue efforts has been greatly exacerbated *-1 by collapsed road surfaces and interrupted power , water , and telephone services .
President Carlos Flores declared a state of emergency , called for an all - out effort *PRO* to save lives , and asked for international relief assistance .

Hell on earth
Relief teams and supplies began arriving from around the world on the day after the quake .
In addition to teams from nearby Mexico , Guatemala , and Venezuela , a Spanish team also arrived very quickly , *PRO* followed * soon thereafter by counterparts from Panama , Nicaragua , Germany , France , and Turkey .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The Taipei City Government 's international search and rescue team</COREF> arrived on January 16 .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">This team , which *T*-1 had received three months of training in the US last year</COREF> , went immediately into action after <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> long air trip , as the search and rescue command center in <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> arranged for <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to head to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT" E_OFF="2">Las Colinas , where the worst of the disaster had taken place *T*-2</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The team</COREF> started out *-1 <COREF ID="ectb_1062.part-001-E3" TYPE="IDENT">using</COREF> advanced equipment capable of *PRO* detecting signs of life under the rubble , including flexible fiber optic video cables and ultra-sensitive audio devices .
When <COREF ID="ectb_1062.part-001-E3" TYPE="IDENT">these methods</COREF> did not yield survivors *T*-1 , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the team</COREF> began *-2 digging and using <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">more aggressive search techniques</COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">These methods</COREF> , too , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">failed</COREF> *-1 to turn up any sign of life .
At <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">that point</COREF> relief teams went into <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Las Colinas</COREF> with bulldozers and mechanical shovels *PRO*-1 to clear out the rubble and retrieve the bodies of the dead .
In <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> condolence message to <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">ROC</COREF> President Chen Shui - bian</COREF> stated that <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-1 having suffered <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">a terrible earthquake of <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own</COREF> in <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">September 1999</COREF> , were acutely aware of what people in <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> were going through *T*-2 .
In addition to the relief assistance provided * by the <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">ROC</COREF> government , a lot of aid also poured forth from the private sector .
The <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">ROC</COREF> Red Cross Society donated 10,000 blankets and 400 tents .
The Chinese Children 's Fund is planning *PRO*-1 to send US$ 300,000 *U* in private donations via the Ministry of Foreign Affairs *PRO* to provide support for 2,000 children .
The governments of <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Taichung County and Nantou County</COREF> , which *T*-1 were hardest hit *-1 by <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the 1999 earthquake in <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> , also made big contributions to the relief effort .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Teams from <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">these areas</COREF></COREF> arrived in <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> *PRO*-1 armed * with experience , an advanced global positioning system , and tunneling equipment .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also donated tents and other necessities .
In the dark days following <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">September 1999</COREF> earthquake</COREF> , the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies donated <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">US$ 27,890,000 *U*</COREF> to <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">these funds</COREF> proved a tremendous help in <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> reconstruction effort .
International relief teams worked around the clock *PRO* to find survivors , and thousands made * homeless by <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the quake</COREF> sheltered * from the cold in donated tents and sleeping bags .
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">Even the dead</COREF> in many cases were transported *-1 to <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> final resting places in donated body bags and coffins .
Now that a similar disaster has been visited *-2 upon one of <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> diplomatic partners , it is time 0 for <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF> to repay <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> debt to the international community *T*-1 .

The power of nature
Major earthquakes in recent years have claimed nearly 20,000 lives in Turkey and over 2,500 in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
The death toll in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> is expected *-1 to climb to over 1,300 .
In the meantime , the Richter 7.9 earthquake in <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">India 's</COREF> western state of Gujarat has completely leveled the town of Bhuj , and official sources expect the death toll to exceed 20,000 .
While relief teams have been dispatched *-1 from around the world , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">India</COREF> indicated that <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would not need assistance from <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> for the time being .
There is nothing 0 anyone can do *T*-1 *PRO* to prevent earthquakes from *PRO* occurring , but specialists have noted that the consequences of the recent quakes were made *-2 worse by man - made factors , such as overpopulation , environmental degradation , and shoddy construction .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> is the most densely populated nation in Central America , with some 6 million people living in a territory covering over 20,000 square kilometers -LRB- about two - thirds the size of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> -RRB- .
The economy has been developing briskly ever since <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> long civil war came to an end in 1992 , and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> plays an important political role both internationally and in the Central American region .
In these respects , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador 's</COREF> situation</COREF> is very similar to <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
Overdevelopment of the hillside at <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Las Colinas</COREF> may have been one cause of the landslide that *T*-1 buried the residential neighborhood down below .
After one has seen so many dead bodies and heard the anguished wailing of bereaved relatives , it *EXP*-1 is hard *PRO* to ignore the wisdom of calls *PRO* to live in harmony with nature .
It *EXP*-1 takes a very long time *PRO* to recover from an earthquake .
After the search and rescue operations have come to an end , <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">reconstruction</COREF> begins .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is a massive undertaking that *T*-1 never proceeds quickly .
In a message to the international community , <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">President Flores</COREF> stated , " <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hope that <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">relief assistance</COREF> has not come to an end .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> should continue as we work on reconstruction . "
If <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">anyone in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> wishes *PRO*-1 to contribute to reconstruction in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are urged *-2 *PRO*-2 to contact the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ' task force on reconstruction -LRB- tel : 02 - 2348 - 2192 or 02 - 2348 - 2195 -RRB- .

<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">El Salvador</COREF> was hit *-1 by a strong earthquake .
<COREF ID="ectb_1062.part-002-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Most of the deaths</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1062.part-002-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">549</COREF> -RRB- were the result of a landslide in <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Las Colinas , on the outskirts of San Salvador</COREF> .
