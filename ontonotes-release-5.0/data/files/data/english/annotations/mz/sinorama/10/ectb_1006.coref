Taiwanese TV Gets Taiwanized *-9 !
Eric Lin / tr. * by Phil Newell
Recently the 8:00 p.m. serials being shown * on television in <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> have shown a trend toward " Taiwanization . "
Three out of the four main broadcast stations are showing <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">prime - time Taiwanese drama</COREF> , and <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are pulling in nearly three - quarters of <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the viewing audience</COREF> .
Of <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">these programs</COREF> , Fortune is in Heaven 's Hands , broadcast * by Formosa Television , stands at the top of the heap .
It *EXP*-2 is said *-1 that , along with pop music , <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">prime - time TV serials</COREF> are one of the most important elements of Taiwanese popular culture , and that <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> reflect social trends .
What then is the relationship between the rise of Taiwanese drama -LRB- that is , mainly in the Taiwanese dialect and focused * on the lives of distinctly Taiwanese - as opposed to " mainlander " - characters -RRB- and contemporary society and culture in <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *T*-9 ?
Do <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">these shows</COREF> reflect the real lives and aspirations of <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the audience</COREF> ?
And what kinds of limitations *T*-9 exist ?

The revival of reality
Little Ho - ho 's line - " *PRO* Do n't beat me any more ! " - reflects one of the more common themes of TV shows done * in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> .
Beating of children , often by an evil stepmother , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> not unusual .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not because Taiwanese are especially firm believers in corporal punishment .
Rather this kind of thing is a " trademark " that *T*-9 has become attached to <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese drama</COREF> over the course of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> history .
As a result , even though " nativist drama " has escaped the stereotypical setting of the Taiwanese countryside of the past and increasingly focuses on contemporary urban life , such provocative scenes - playing to elemental emotions *PRO* to pull on the heart - strings - are still common .
" <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese serials</COREF> depict the daily life of ordinary people the way 0 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do *?* *T*-9 because of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> development process , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ko Yu - fen</COREF> , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an associate professor of mass communications at Shih Hsin University , who *T*-1 has done a study of <COREF ID="ectb_1006-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> TV drama</COREF> .
" And now , because of the trend in society of *PRO* reviving <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> as the mother tongue , Taiwanese drama has been able *PRO*-9 to leap into prime time *PRO*-9 to become the mainstream offering in the past few years . "
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">The 8:00 p.m. time slot</COREF> has long been the flagship and leading money maker for television stations .
For <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">a program</COREF> to get into <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">this slot</COREF> , besides *PRO* being commercially viable , in the past <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> also had *-9 to be politically correct .
This used *-9 to mean : " No use of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwanese language</COREF> . "
Because the government wanted *PRO*-9 to promote Mandarin , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> was officially seen *-1 as a rustic dialect , and was never eligible for prime time .
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The three government - run television stations of that era</COREF> - <COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="106" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">China Television</COREF> <COREF ID="106" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- CTV -RRB-</COREF> , <COREF ID="109" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chinese Television Service</COREF> <COREF ID="109" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- CTS -RRB-</COREF> , and <COREF ID="112" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Taiwan Television</COREF> <COREF ID="112" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- TTV -RRB-</COREF></COREF></COREF> - had a tacit agreement that <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would only show Taiwanese programs at noon *RNR*-1 or in the 6:30 p.m. time slot *RNR*-1 , when most viewers would be housewives and elderly people *T*-9 .
The programming for these time slots was low - budget , and the subject matter limited to ordinary life in <COREF ID="ectb_1006-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> unsophisticated rural past , mostly tragic tales of mistreated daughters - in - law and the like , or family comedies .
Thus , for a long time , Taiwanese drama gave people the impression of *PRO* being lowbrow .

It was not until 1990 , with the broadcasting of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the series Love</COREF> on <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">CTS</COREF> , that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the prime - time language taboo</COREF> was even partly challenged *-9 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">This series</COREF> also raised the quality of Taiwanese drama , and planted the seeds for future efforts .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">The show</COREF> was set *-9 against the background of the August 7th Flood of 1959 .
The story portrayed how some <COREF ID="ectb_1006-part-003-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> and mainlanders went from mutual misunderstanding to mutual forgiveness *T*-9 .
The performers spoke in both <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Mandarin</COREF> and <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> .
Because <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the language taboo</COREF> has long carried heavy political undertones - the opposition has always preferred the use of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> , the ruling party has , until recently , almost exclusively favored <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Mandarin</COREF> - the producers invited many people from the arts community *PRO*-2 to confirm that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> was essential for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> , so as *PRO* to dispel the suspicions of those who *T*-1 would see political motives behind language choice .
Unfortunately , the effort was less than a complete success .
For one thing , stereotypes remained strong , and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Love</COREF> still retained many of the old traditions , *PRO*-9 being a tragic small family drama focusing on a young bride facing hard times after *PRO* moving into the husband 's home .
Moreover , because of opposition from high officials at <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the television network</COREF> , after several episodes , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the performers who *T*-9 had previously spoken in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF></COREF> had <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> dialogue changed *-1 to " <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Mandarin</COREF> with a Taiwanese accent . "
However , because the plot was realistic , ratings were unprecedented , and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Love</COREF> even defeated <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Widow 's Watch , based on a novel by *RNR*-1 , and also produced * by *RNR*-1 , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">the vastly popular romance writer Chiung Yao</COREF> , and broadcast * on CTV</COREF> .
At that time , many commentators suggested that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Love</COREF> was successful largely because of the use of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="107" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lin Ling - ling</COREF> , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a script writer for <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Widow 's Watch</COREF></COREF></COREF> , says that the real reason 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Love</COREF> succeeded *T*-9 was because of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> realistic depiction of the lives of <COREF ID="ectb_1006-part-003-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> opinion is that " love stories involving constant hitting and screaming and dramatic twists and turns are not the stuff of real life , and <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Chiung Yao 's</COREF> series</COREF> departed too far from reality .
This in fact has been a chronic problem of Taiwan 's dramatic serials . "
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Love</COREF> succeeded largely because <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> wedded realism to Taiwanese subject matter .

Politics in command ?
However , though <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the series</COREF> was popular , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did not immediately spark a wave of enthusiasm for Taiwanese subject matter .
The government around that time adopted a policy of *PRO* allowing producers to go to mainland China *PRO*-1 to film , and there was <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">a sudden craze for martial arts series and love stories framed * against a mainland backdrop</COREF> .
Still , television stations and producers had awakened to the existence of an audience for " nativist " Taiwanese drama .
After the Qingdao Lake incident in 1994 , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">" mainland fever "</COREF> plummeted , and <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">nativist stories using <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwanese language</COREF></COREF> once again saw <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> star rising .
This time <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> went right at major political taboos like the February 28 Incident of 1947 .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Writer Lin Ling - ling</COREF> used the White Terror as subject matter *PRO*-9 to write <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the second major nativist prime - time drama in Taiwan television history</COREF> - <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was so popular that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> producer</COREF> , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsu Chin - liang</COREF> , ended up *-1 making a trilogy around the same theme .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> explains : " <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> always want *PRO*-9 to write a Taiwanese drama against the backdrop of great events , and the February 28 Incident was at that time just beginning *-2 to get intensive open discussion , so there was a lot of commercial viability as well . "
*PRO*-1 Owing to <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the series '</COREF> popularity , lead actor Lun Hsiao - hua has become a major television star , while <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">female lead Chen Mei - feng</COREF> established <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> image as a traditional Taiwanese woman of gentility and virtue , and has since gotten numerous roles and television commercials .
However , says *?* <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> with a laugh , things did n't go exactly as <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> expected .
" Because the writer , director , and actors all had different political orientations , after the first several episodes which *T*-1 laid out the background of the era were produced *-9 , the plot shifted toward traditional family relations and romance , along the lines of the typical prime - time serial . "
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">The series</COREF> was nonetheless a watershed .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> was no longer taboo , and indeed identification with " Taiwanese-ness " came *PRO*-9 to be highly admired .

<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Ko Yu - fen</COREF> states that it *EXP*-1 is not difficult *PRO* to understand these trends against the backdrop of society at that time .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan Outlaws of the Marsh</COREF> was broadcast *-2 just after the first direct popular elections for municipal mayors and provincial governor , when <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the " underground " call - in television programs</COREF> were at <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> peak of popularity *T*-9 , and when discussion of " Taiwanese identity " was at a fever pitch *T*-1 .

<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> laughs , " Even though <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> usually do n't have any interest in *PRO* watching TV , at that time <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> tuned in at eight sharp every night , as a kind of moral support . "
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Ko Yu - fen</COREF> says , however , that times have changed .
Linguistic and historical conditions politicized <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese drama</COREF> .
There had always been controversy over <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
But the political significance faded , and , with <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the daughter - in - law series</COREF> beginning in 1995 , <COREF ID="ectb_1006.part-005-E5" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese drama</COREF> became embroiled in a very different controversy - that <COREF ID="ectb_1006.part-005-E5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was oversimplified and stereotypical , and that the clock had been turned *-9 back to the early days of Taiwanese - language programming .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">The daughter - in - law series</COREF> was a collection of all - Taiwanese - language stories broadcast * by CTS , describing the relationship between daughters - in - law and mothers - in - law in Taiwan 's traditional rural society .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The first of <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the series</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Astonishing Daughter - in - Law</COREF> , got an enthusiastic audience response , and <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the show , which *T*-1 like all prime - time serials was broadcast *-1 nightly Monday to Friday</COREF> , lasted for nearly a year .

The hard - pressed daughter in law
The story of The Astonishing Daughter - in - Law is quite simple .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The daughter - in - law , played * by <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Chang Yu - yen</COREF></COREF> , is mistreated *-9 by <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mother - in - law</COREF> , and , with outsiders butting in and causing trouble , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> gets abused *-2 from beginning to end .
Yet <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> maintains <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> traditional womanly virtues , never fights back , and in the end is rewarded *-9 with a happy ending .
Although <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> does not speak <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> very well , her pitiable demeanor won a lot of sympathy from the audience .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Juan Chin - jung</COREF> , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Changhua County civil servant and longtime fan of TV serials</COREF></COREF> , says critically , " It *EXP*-2 drove <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *PRO*-1 nuts *PRO* watching <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the daughter - in - law</COREF> just sit there and take abuse from <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mother - in - law</COREF> day in and day out .
Also , the costumes and sets were so crude , there was no difference from a typical 6:30 show . "
Yet , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says *?* , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> grandmother was in tears every day , *PRO*-1 explaining that young women today could never understand the suffering and indignities endured * by daughters - in - law in the past .
Ko Yu - fen ascribes the success of <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the daughter - in - law series</COREF> to several factors :
" By *PRO* playing on people 's heart strings , using <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese language</COREF> , and being set * against the background of that bitter era , <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the daughter - in - law series</COREF> brought together all the traditional elements of the Taiwanese drama , but in addition added new structure and packaging , and integrated the spiciness and conflict typical of an 8:00 show .
No wonder <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was so successful . "
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Ling - ling</COREF> says that criticism of 8:00 serials for *PRO* being melodramatic is certainly not without foundation , yet , however people may criticize *T*-1 , there are still viewers who *T*-9 ca n't get enough .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">The audience</COREF> is composed *-9 mainly of older folk and housewives .
In general , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-9 to watch something 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-2 to really think too much about *T*-1 .
*PRO* The simpler 0 the characters and the plot *?* *T*-1 , and the more conflict 0 there is *T*-2 , the better .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> adds that intellectuals criticize such shows but in fact do n't watch TV .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Television stations</COREF> have always based <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> decisions on ratings , and it *EXP*-1 is virtually impossible *PRO* to expect that <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will change a proven formula .
" Rather than *PRO* say that serials are a mirror of life , it *EXP*-1 would be better *PRO* to say that <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">identify</COREF> with the characters in these dramas even if <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own lives are not as dramatic . "
These are the terms used * by <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tsai Yen</COREF> , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a professor in the department of broadcasting and television at National Chengchi University</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is particularly the case for older people and housewives .
According to <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Tsai</COREF> , the formula for success revolves around romance or family relations .
For dramatic effect , there need *-2 to be elements of hatred or revenge , and usually one irredeemably evil character whose purpose *T*-1 is *PRO* to create obstacles to the romantic or career success of the main character .
The focus is extremely narrow - personal achievement .
Social issues serve only as background or embellishment .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">The daughter - in - law series</COREF> precisely fits this structure .

Realistic fashion
After the daughter - in - law series , there was a uniformity in dramatic serials all following the trend .
Taiwanese drama went into a steady decline .
However , just when things looked bleakest *T*-9 , nativist drama began *-1 to break out of its previous framework with the appearance of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the " river of time " structure , characterized * by a cross-generational story depicting long - term social evolution in <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">This format</COREF> incorporates the rural themes of traditional Taiwanese drama , but the stories evolve with time , and also portray modern urban life .
Not only has <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">this format</COREF> given new life to Taiwanese drama , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has also pioneered <COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">an entirely new type of television drama</COREF> - <COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">contemporary realism</COREF> .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Formosa Television</COREF> had enthusiastic audiences for <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Springtime Stepmother 's Heart</COREF> in 1998 .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">The character of actress Pai Ping - ping</COREF> played against the stereotype of the abusive stepmother , *PRO*-9 instead being a woman who *T*-1 brings two of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> own children into a marriage into a wealthy family .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> has *-9 to deal on the one hand with the lack of understanding from <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mother - in - law and on the other look after four children from different families as well as the husband 's first wife , who *T*-1 suffers from mental illness .
And after financial setbacks , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> also has *-9 to support the whole family .
Because <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the series</COREF> was so popular , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">FTV</COREF> seized the opportunity and presented a sequel based * on the loves and hates of the third generation , which *T*-9 , as *PRO* expected * , also was very well received *-9 .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Springtime Stepmother 's Heart</COREF> pulled <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">FTV</COREF> financially out of the red and into the black , and is considered *-9 an extremely remarkable event in <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> television history .
Executive chairman Chen Kang - hsin proudly calls the new format developed * by <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">FTV</COREF> " *PRO*-1 contemporary drama . "

<COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> struggles *PRO*-9 to raise <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> infant son</COREF> , and is a frequent target of criticism from <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mother - in - law .
<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">The son</COREF> then grows into adulthood , and all the feelings - gratitude , revenge , love , hate - of the older generation carry on into the younger .
In the city the children help each other and compete against each other as <COREF ID="ectb_1006.part-007-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the story</COREF> grows increasingly explosive .
The combination of traditional Taiwanese and contemporary factors has made <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the show</COREF> a hit .
<COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chang - yu</COREF> says that recently three of the four broadcast stations have been showing Taiwanese drama , but <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">FTV 's</COREF> ratings stand alone , far ahead of all the others .
<COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">A show</COREF> can not be popular simply by *PRO* using <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese language</COREF> , <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says *?* - the audience must be able *PRO*-1 to identify with <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
This is how <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">the series Real Love from Hong Kong cable TV</COREF> has stayed so popular that <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has run *PRO*-1 uninterrupted for several years *T*-9 .

The success of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">serials</COREF> means that TV stations in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> just keep on *PRO* cranking <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> out , broadcasting <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">episodes</COREF> as quickly as <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are shot *-9 .
This special feature of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> 8:00 time slot means that one can naturally not be too picky about quality .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lu Hsiao - fen</COREF> , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a film star who *T*-9 has won numerous awards at the Golden Horse and Asia - Pacific film festivals and who *T*-1 has recently jumped into prime time as the female lead in Fortune</COREF></COREF> , explains : " They have <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1006.part-008-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a special name *ICH*-2 for shows that *T*-4 are being broadcast *-4 episode by episode as each one is shot *-3</COREF> : ' <COREF ID="ectb_1006.part-008-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">ON programming</COREF></COREF> .

<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> finds <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">this situation</COREF> less than ideal .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says that in order *PRO* to keep up with the audience 's ever - changing tastes , scripts are being rewritten *-9 right up to the last minute .
Naturally <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">television actors</COREF> do not have the luxury that movie actors enjoy *T*-4 of *PRO* allowing <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> time 0 *PRO* to slowly get in the right frame of mind for a role or scene *T*-1 , but even so , given the fact that TV actors must rely almost exclusively on dialogue and body language *PRO*-2 to keep the audience 's attention , the fact that shooting is so hurried not only waters down the quality of the performance , there is little time 0 *PRO* even to get the lines right *T*-3 .
Such conditions , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> feels *?* , make for productions that *T*-9 are really too rough around the edges .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Chou You , who *T*-9 has produced more than 4,000 hours of dramatic series for television</COREF> , says that prime time is like a battlefield for television stations .
Sometimes the producer ca n't call the shots .
Personally , <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> has always preferred *PRO*-1 to begin *-1 broadcasting only after the entire series has been completed *-2 , *PRO*-1 to ensure quality control .
But if <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">a series</COREF> is doing well , the station will want *PRO*-9 to extend <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and if ratings are less than ideal , the series must be prepared *-1 to wrap up at any moment .
<COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT" E_OFF="2">The series on which <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Chou</COREF> has recently been working *T*-2</COREF> had <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the final rushes</COREF> confiscated *-3 by <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> so that <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can decide how *PRO* to edit <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-9 , in order *PRO* to determine how long <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the series</COREF> will actually run *T*-1 .

But there is no quick - fix .
With <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the practical environment</COREF> being what <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-9 , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> will simply have *-1 to think <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way out of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> limitations .
" <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">ON programming</COREF> is simply the way 0 Taiwan television works *T*-9 .
If the station strategy is set *-9 up that way , it *EXP*-1 's unlikely 0 they will change .
The only solution is through restructuring of the content , *PRO* strengthening the rhythms , reducing the use of pointless patter *PRO* to draw out the series , improving the dramatic structure , and adding new vitality to the roles . "
But how ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> takes for example feminist issues , about which <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is particularly concerned *T*-1 .
Twenty years ago , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> wrote a TV serial that *T*-9 overturned the tradition that the female lead had *-1 to be chaste , unmarried , and dependent on men ; instead <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> female lead was a middle - aged divorcee with children and a relationship with a younger man .
Society was shocked from top to bottom .
Today , as <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> produces <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Fortune</COREF> , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> still devotes special attention to the molding of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the women 's</COREF> roles .
From the character of the grandmother to that of the daughter , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> insists that the script give <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> independent and strong - willed vitality .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says , " Although you can say that prime time serials are merchandise and not art , you have *-9 to present up - to - date positive values .

*PRO* Developing overseas markets
Taiwanese television serials have always sold well abroad .
But some people are concerned that an overemphasis on Taiwanese themes and language will stifle the development of overseas sales .
" By nature , television drama is very localized .
Because of cultural differences , overseas audiences will not necessarily like the same things 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> audiences do *?* *T*-9 , " says *T*-1 reporter Lien Chang - yu .
That is why <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">many " blue - chip " producers who *T*-2 control overseas copyrights</COREF> are unwilling *PRO*-1 to touch nativist serials *T*-9 .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> prefer *PRO*-9 to do martial arts or love stories that *T*-1 focus on no particular era or social backdrop .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Ling - ling</COREF> , on the other hand , believes that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese drama</COREF> should have no problems *PRO*-1 holding <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own against competition from other areas .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says that <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1006-part-010-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> drama</COREF> generally maintains good pacing , but the way 0 <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> handle dialogue , content , and emotion *T*-9 is not very convincing .
PRC TV provides <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">dramas which *T*-9 interpret actual historical events -LRB- as *PRO* opposed * to <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> " historical " dramas which *T*-1 are mainly just made - up stories in period costume -RRB-</COREF> , but <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are too slow - moving .
Japanese TV relies mostly on packaging of well - known " idols , " with most of the effort going into the aesthetics of presentation , and little emphasis on storyline .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> television drama</COREF> , on the other hand , has conflict and intensity , and if <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is well packaged , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should do well in the overseas market .
" You ca n't say that there 's no overseas market for <COREF ID="ectb_1006.part-010-E3" TYPE="IDENT">drama</COREF> just because <COREF ID="ectb_1006.part-010-E3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is nativist Taiwanese .
After all , <COREF ID="ectb_1006.part-010-E2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1006-part-010-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> drama series</COREF> have dominated the Asian market for years , yet <COREF ID="ectb_1006.part-010-E2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> also use <COREF ID="96" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Chinese dialect</COREF> - <COREF ID="96" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Cantonese</COREF> - and are also set *-1 against the backdrop of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own <COREF ID="ectb_1006-part-010-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> society .
However , due to the strength of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> entertainment industry , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've been able *PRO*-9 to penetrate everywhere , " says *T*-1 Tsai Yen .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> can learn from this experience .

Talent flow
As interactions between <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> have grown , over the past few years there have been many cases of cooperative filming involving <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> , or of the hiring of technicians or performers from one area *PRO* to work in another .
For example , for <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the martial arts dramas of Yang Pei - pei</COREF> , the scripts and actors come from <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , the director and the costume designer are from <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> , and the series are filmed *-1 in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> *PRO* using mainland technicians .
*PRO* Technically speaking , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are extremely well done *-1 .
The same goes for Chiung Yao 's romantic dramas .
However , given the different cultural backgrounds of these people , there are limits to cooperation , and if you factor in political considerations , that makes the situation even more complex .
" <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Cross-national cooperation</COREF> is the fastest way 0 *PRO* to get an infusion of fresh blood *T*-9 , but <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not a long - term solution , " says *T*-1 Lien Chang - yu .
Recently <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> has begun *-9 to <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">limit</COREF> the number of people who *T*-1 can work in cooperative projects in order *PRO* to protect <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own TV industry , and sudden changes such as <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> will inevitably have an impact .
Prime time programming has long been a weaver of dreams for Taiwanese audiences .
But there is a huge difference between today 's society and that of 30 years ago .
If the dreams woven * by the serials stay the same , or are even inferior , inevitably the audience will decline .
Given the ever growing pluralization of society in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , these shows must find new talent , overcome formulaic stories , and halt the decline in audience share .
Those in the industry must figure out how *PRO* to draw people back *T*-9 .

So - called " ON programming " - meaning that series episodes are shot *-1 right before the time of broadcast - is a special feature of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> prime - time televised serials .
