Waves of traffic are heading out from Taipei toward the suburbs , toward the open expanses in the riverbed area of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Neihu</COREF> .
Once the cars pass the Minchuan *RNR*-1 or the Second Macarthur *RNR*-1 Bridge , the landscape becomes dotted with the large signs of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">major retailers</COREF> .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> include <COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Costco</COREF> , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the third largest superstore retailer in the United States</COREF> ; <COREF ID="26" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">B-AMP-Q</COREF> , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the largest do - it - yourself hardware chain in Britain</COREF> ; and <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> own RT - Mart .
*PRO* Shopping at <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">these large stores</COREF> has quickly become a part of leisure - time life in <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">A Mrs. Chao , who *T*-1 lives in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Neihu</COREF></COREF> , explains that on weekends or vacation days <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the whole family</COREF> sleeps late .
Once <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are up , if there 's nothing special on the agenda , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> go to B-AMP-Q *PRO*-1 to look at stuff for the home .
Then when <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get tired *T*-1 , they go to Costco for some Pizza or muffins .
Finally , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> end up *-2 in <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">RT - Mart</COREF> , where they buy groceries *T*-1 .
The whole trip takes about half the day .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> had thought that <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">these stores</COREF> were only crowded on the weekends , but on a rainy weekday in November <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> decided 0 <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did n't feel like *PRO* cooking and went *PRO*-1 to buy some prepared foods at <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the RT - Mart 's</COREF> deli department .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> discovered that there was n't a single open parking space among the hundreds on the first and second floors of the parking structure .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> was quite surprised *PRO*-1 to find that business was so good on a weekday .
" *PRO* Shopping at one of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">these superstores</COREF> is a lot like *PRO* shopping at a department store , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">a Mr. Ko , who *T*-1 works as an engineer for a chemical company in <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Kaohsiung</COREF></COREF> .
" You go when you 're bored *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">Ko</COREF> has discovered that as more and more of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">these stores</COREF> have opened in <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Kaohsiung</COREF> , <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife go to department stores less , because in department stores you can only buy clothes , but in superstores you can buy daily necessities , hardware and so forth , and the selection is better .
