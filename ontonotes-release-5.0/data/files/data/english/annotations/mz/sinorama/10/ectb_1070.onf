    Surveys made before logging began at Mt. Ali, Taiwan's earliest cypress logging area, showed that there were more than
    300,000 false cypresses over 1,000 years old, but today all that remains of them is a few lonely-looking old trees
    scattered among introduced Japanese red cedar-LRB-Cryptomeria japonica-RRB-and flowering cherries.
