From Hong Kong 's airport , you can go straight to <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> on a Global Express bus .
With 27 departures a day , these buses run * by a <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firm out of <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> take <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> expats</COREF> to <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> adopted home</COREF> , which *T*-1 boasts the largest concentration of <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms in the PRC .
*PRO*-2 Invoking the Taiwanese business battle cry of " victory to those who *T*-1 strive the hardest , " 20,000 - 30,000 <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> expats in <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> have in little more than a decade turned a county of banana and lichee plantations into a big city with exports behind only Shenzhen 's and <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai 's</COREF> .

It 's 10:00 at night , but <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the city of Dongguan in Guangdong Province</COREF> is still hopping .
Cars clocking 80 kilometers an hour zip along <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">roads that *T*-1 reveal hardly a trace of the farming villages that <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> linked *T*-2 not long ago</COREF> .
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese business people here</COREF> run <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> factories</COREF> like <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> drive <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cars , in high gear .
<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">The factories</COREF> are lit up *-1 at night for overtime shifts .

In the busy Fucheng district , you find the Taiwanese bars , covered * from door to rooftop with flashing lights
.
<COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">The lights , like the karaoke singing within <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> , pulsate until dawn no matter the season .
Inside there is a raucous crowd .
<COREF ID="238" TYPE="IDENT">A Taiwanese businessman down from Harbin</COREF> boasts that <COREF ID="238" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> auto plant up in the northeast sits on a lot as vast as <COREF ID="246" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei City</COREF> and has a green light *PRO* to sell on the domestic market .
In another room a Taiwanese businessman based * in <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> carouses with a party cadre from Yunnan who *T*-1 is trying *PRO*-1 to attract investment .

Amid all the merrymaking , one gets a sense of what <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> must have been like *T*-1 in the thirties .

High concentration of <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms
Before the 21st century had even arrived , a bright economic star had risen over southern China .
Ever since economic reforms accelerated on <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> when Deng Xiaoping made a tour of the south in early 1992 *T*-1 , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">four southern Cantonese cities</COREF> - <COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Zhongshan , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> , Shunde , and Nanhai</COREF> - have earned a reputation as the " four tigers " of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Guangdong Province</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> leads the pack .
" The year before last <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> total exports were third on <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> , *PRO*-1 trailing only <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Shenzhen 's</COREF> and Shanghai 's , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Jiang Suwu</COREF> , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">a graduate of Wuhan University 's Chinese department who *T*-3 came south *PRO*-3 to work in the planning department of a <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firm in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF></COREF> .
" <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> had more than 15,000 foreign , <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> firms , and economic growth for that year reached 26 % . "
In ancient times <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> was covered *-1 with lichee plantations whose fruit *T*-2 was favored *-2 by the imperial consort Yang Guifei .
Just a little more than a decade ago <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> was still a largely agricultural area , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> landscape a patchwork of rice paddies and corn fields .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has since been completely made over *-1 into a " boundless industrial park " with an area of 2,520 square kilometers , a population of more than 5 million , and more than 3,000 <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang Han - wen</COREF> , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the chairman of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Taiwan Business Association of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF></COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">TBAD</COREF> -RRB-</COREF></COREF> , says that development started in the late 1980s .
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> firms</COREF> , with <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> proximity and fluent Cantonese -LRB- also the local dialect in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> -RRB- , were first .
The Taiwanese , first coming about 1989 , followed .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Each arrival</COREF> seemed *-1 to bring many more on <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> heels .
Taiwan firms are now the most important source of foreign investment in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> .
*PRO* Consider the booming electronics industry .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">Eighty percent of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan 's</COREF> 1,800 computer - related companies</COREF> are from <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> and Macau .
In terms of production value , <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> account for at least half of this RMB 50 billion *U* local industry .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> holds the highest concentration of <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms anywhere on <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> .
According to <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD</COREF> statistics , there are now 30,000 Taiwanese companies on <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> , -LRB- official PRC statistics , which *T*-1 include service - industry firms , put the number at 45,000 -RRB- .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Guangdong Province</COREF> can boast one - third of the total , of which 3,200 *T*-1 are in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> .
Most of these are telecom , cable , plastics , shoes , electronics and electric machinery companies .
Why has <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> been such a magnet for <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms *T*-1 ?
Kao Wen - lai points out that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> is strategically located *-1 between <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Shenzhen</COREF> and <COREF ID="167" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Guangzhou</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="167" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Canton</COREF> -RRB- and accessible to the entire Pearl River delta .
It is three hours by car to <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> and one and a half hours by boat to Humen .
When *PRO* compared * to <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Shenzhen</COREF> *T*-2 , moreover , land and labor in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> are cheap .
" The local cadres have been smart , *PRO*-1 providing all manner of land and tax incentives , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="191" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen Ming - chih</COREF> , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD 's</COREF> secretary general</COREF> .

Two keys to the miracle
One afternoon in the days before the Chinese New Year , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese businessmen wearing suits</COREF> arrived at the People 's Government administration building in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan 's</COREF> Qishi district</COREF> .
After a long wait , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> sat down at a table *PRO*-1 to negotiate with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Qishi 's</COREF> Communist Party secretary , the district chief , and various staff from <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> foreign economic office .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Qishi 's</COREF> factory rents , electricity charges and land leases were all focuses of discussion .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD</COREF> , as *PRO* is frequently the case , introduced the two parties .
" The factory rent was set *-1 at RMB 8.00 *U* -LRB- about NT$ 32 *U* -RRB- a square meter .
The electricity charge was RMB .87 *U* a kilowatt hour , and there were various tax incentives , " explains *T*-1 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Jung - tuo , who *T*-2 notes 0 there is still room for negotiation</COREF> .
All in all , it was a very attractive package .
In 1990 , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> went to <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Malaysia</COREF> *PRO*-1 thinking about *PRO* opening a factory there , but <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> discovered that <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Malaysia 's</COREF> market was much smaller than <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland 's</COREF> and <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> labor costs twice as high .
The style of life was too different there , there was a language divide , and the roads were poor .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">The mainland</COREF> was a much better fit for <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> printed circuit boards company</COREF> .
Now , little more than a decade later , <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> 20 - 30 workers have grown to 2,000 .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">The company</COREF> is once again preparing *PRO*-1 to expand <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> physical plant .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> acknowledges that it *EXP*-1 was a risky move *PRO* to come to <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> , but " if you 're going *-2 to die , you might as well die among your own people . "
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> traces <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> ancestry to Guangdong and affirms that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> decision *PRO* to set up in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> " involves ethnic pride . "
Although low land and labor costs are <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan 's</COREF> main attractions , <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms also choose the locale for the networks of people and producers that *T*-1 have been built up *-1 among Taiwanese in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> over the last ten years .
These two kinds of networks , says *?* <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">H.D. Yeh - who *T*-1 served as <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD 's</COREF> president for two terms</COREF> - were instrumental in *PRO* creating the " Taiwanese economic miracle . "
<COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">H.D. Yeh</COREF> points out that competition in the 21st century is all about speed .
When customers in America make purchase orders *T*-1 , the whole process , including *PRO* drawing up the contract and manufacturing the goods , requires four months .
But Taiwanese firms can deliver in 15 days .
" There are two keys , " <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
" One is that all the upstream and downstream factories are here .
You can assemble a computer completely from parts made * within 50 kilometers . "
And the second key is that when you deal with Taiwanese companies *T*-1 , you do n't have *-2 to endure a long contract process .
Everything starts *-1 rolling with a single telephone call .
Taiwanese business people are always playing golf , singing karaoke or chewing betel nut together .
" Everyone is always asking how everyone else is doing *T*-1 - it 's a way of *PRO* networking and building up good relations , " <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> says *T*-2 .
Andrew Yeh recalls that when <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> first set up in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> in 1990 *T*-1 , " Even screws had *-2 to be brought in *-2 from <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> . "
But now <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> sources virtually all of the necessary raw materials and parts on <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> and is reliant for very little on <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
" What does <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">industrial emigration</COREF> entail *T*-1 ?
Usually <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> means downstream industries coming first , *PRO*-2 forcing the mid-stream industries *PRO*-3 to follow , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="206" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sylvia Yang</COREF> , <COREF ID="206" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">deputy chairperson of <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD 's</COREF> women 's division</COREF> .
And in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> downstream <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms have expanded into the mid-stream , *PRO*-1 becoming more vertically integrated .
<COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">Tahsin Printing</COREF> only made paper boxes in <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> but when <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> set up a plant in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> discovered that it *EXP*-2 was hard *PRO* to obtain <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">the paper rolls 0 <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> needed *T*-3</COREF> and thus learned how *PRO* to make <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> *T*-4 .
Now <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> makes paper boxes both from rolled paper and from colored flat paper .

To <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">each</COREF> <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own domain
Many companies have expanded into new business realms in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> .
A frequently cited example is <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Primax</COREF> , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">H.D. Yeh 's</COREF> electronics firm</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The company</COREF> rented a factory in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">1989</COREF> and at first produced labor - intensive power surge protectors .
After three years , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> began in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">1992</COREF> *-1 to invest massively on <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> , *PRO*-1 establishing computer mouse production lines .
Thereafter , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Primax</COREF> launched new products *ICH*-1 every year : cellular phone parts , overhead projectors , paper shredders , scanners . . .
*PRO*-1 Constantly expanding <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> product lines and production capacity , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Primax</COREF> expanded from a single <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> plant with 25 workers in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">1989</COREF> to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> current nine factories and 4,000 - plus workforce .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Primax 's</COREF> performance , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">H.D. Yeh</COREF> notes *?* , pushed <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> mother company in <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-1 to go *PRO*-1 public seven years ago .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Primax</COREF> is one of the few <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> electronics companies with a definite " <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> orientation . "
" It *EXP*-1 does n't cost much *PRO* to set up a factory in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> , and shipping times are stable .
These are helpful to <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the mother company</COREF> both in terms of *PRO* controlling costs and *PRO* filling large orders , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan Hsu Fu Chi Foods , which *T*-1 sells candy , cakes and candied fruit in the mainland domestic market</COREF> , is another good example .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> began production there in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">1992</COREF> , *PRO*-1 formally opening <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own plant in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> in 1994 .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">The company</COREF> now has three factories in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> , with a combined area of 120,000 square meters , that *T*-1 produce 200 tons of candy , 70 tons of Chinese - style cakes , and 180 tons of gelatin and pudding a day .
" <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> produce 300 - 500 container loads of food a month .

<COREF ID="120" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Norman Hsu</COREF> , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> vice president</COREF> , says that after one invests on <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> , layouts of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> factories seem *-1 exceedingly cramped .
" There 's a totally different sense of space . "
" <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> is by <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> one - thirteenth the size of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , " notes *T*-1 <COREF ID="138" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen Ming - chih</COREF> , <COREF ID="138" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">secretary general of the Taiwan Business Association</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> factories are more than ten times the sizes of similar plants in <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
One factory building at the Talingshan furniture plant is 380 meters long .
*PRO* Walking the perimeter of a leading electronics plant in Qishi is " like *PRO* playing four holes of golf . "
Like soldiers , workers often have *-1 to take different shifts in the cafeteria .

Victory to the strivers

All the job - related pressures and evenings out with fellow Taiwanese business people or Communist Party cadres result in ill health for many <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> business people on <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> .

The Taiwanese entrepreneurial spirit has blossomed here by *PRO* processing goods for export through <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> in addition to *PRO* making the most of connections between local <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms .
With 3,000 Taiwan - owned businesses here , and <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">10 - 20,000 Taiwanese business people</COREF> and <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> dependants coming in and out every day , the <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Dong - guan</COREF> area has already developed an economic circle in which <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms</COREF> can conduct most of <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> business among <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> *T*-1 .
In the vibrant district of Houjian , there is an area that locals call *T*-1 *PRO*-1 Taiwan Town .
A casual look around reveals shop signs familiar to any Taiwanese : Taichung Goose , Ah - shui Shih 's Pig Knuckle Kingdom , Yungho Soy Milk , the Mantu Hair Salon . . . . and most of the customers are Taiwanese .
Restaurants serve up authentic Taiwanese fare like " pineapples and bitter melon chicken " and " sesame oil chicken . "
In November 1998 <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Global Express</COREF> , <COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firm</COREF></COREF> , even opened up a shuttle bus to <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong 's</COREF> airport .
<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Global Express</COREF> serves as a good example of Taiwanese corporate agility .
Originally , arrivals from <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> en route to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> had *-1 to board buses run * by a <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> - based and mainland - financed travel agency .
" But <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> felt that the service left something 0 *T*-1 to be desired *-1 , and that a lot of time would always be wasted *-2 while holders of ' Taiwanese Compatriot Visas ' cleared customs , " notes *T*-3 <COREF ID="207" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">David Chang</COREF> , <COREF ID="207" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">Global Travel Holding 's</COREF> executive director</COREF> .
Two years ago , <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">this Taiwanese travel agency</COREF> began *-1 to talk with the mainland customs and border inspection agencies and negotiated a deal 0 *PRO* to get the route *T*-2 .
" <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> tell Taiwanese business people that *PRO* <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">riding</COREF> <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> buses is safe , the service is good , and that <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> makes the trip through customs easy . "

In enemy territory
As soon as you 're through customs at <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> , you see <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">them</COREF> : <COREF ID="7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">women draped * with <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">beauty pageant - like sashes with the Chinese characters for <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">" Global Travel "</COREF> emblazoned * across <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Pushing <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">small luggage carts</COREF> , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> lead customers to the buses .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have become a " must - see " tourist sight for Taiwanese visitors to Dongguan .
" At first <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> thought of *PRO* talking with <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> airport</COREF> about *PRO* renting a counter , " explains *T*-1 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> .
" But for just one - fourth of a six square - meter booth , the rent comes to HK$ 200,000 *U* . "
So <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> thought that instead of *PRO* spending that much money on a booth it *EXP*-1 made more sense *PRO* to lower operating costs and pass these along in the form of lower fares for <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> customers .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> never expected that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the luggage carts</COREF> would in fact make it *EXP*-1 much easier for customers to find <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">sprawling <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> airport</COREF> and would become an easily recognizable company trademark .
" Now mainland Chinese travel agencies have started *-1 copying the way 0 <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> use the carts *T*-3 , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> , *PRO*-4 laughing .
Since <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Global</COREF> buses started *-1 plying this route in November 1988 , daily bus departures have risen from 4 to 27 , with over 20,000 riders a month .

<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> appears *-2 to have a bright future .
" <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms here</COREF> now are powerful enough *PRO*-2 to get two or three members of the Legislative Yuan to represent <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> interests , " holds *T*-1 one senior reporter .
Although <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD 's</COREF> Yeh</COREF> believes that investment prospects on the mainland are good , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does acknowledge the precariousness of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> position in hostile territory .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> business interests</COREF> can not put down <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> guard .
Because of <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> experience with rapid modernization , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">many CCP cadres</COREF> have sought employment with Taiwanese firms , *PRO*-1 hoping *PRO*-1 to learn from the masters .
At the first opportunity , however , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> leave *PRO*-1 to set up shop for <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
" The student then challenges the master , " explains *T*-1 Sylvia Yang , *PRO*-2 detailing how <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">these mainland upstarts</COREF> go on *PRO*-3 to compete with the very <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms that *T*-4 taught <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> all 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know *T*-5 *T*-6 .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">This scenario</COREF> should be familiar to Taiwanese .
" <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> happens in <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> too . "
Apart from *PRO* keeping up <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> guard , it *EXP*-1 is even more important that <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan firms</COREF> raise <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> productivity and technological level .
" Many manufacturers , even those in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> , will not survive , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> .
Taiwan firms find it *EXP*-1 difficult *PRO* to adjust to the instability of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland 's</COREF> investment environment , as well as the laws there that *T*-2 seemingly change overnight .
The year before last <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> announced a new tax system , under which raw materials imported * by foreign firms would be taxed *-1 at a rate of 17 % , with 9 % being returned *-3 to the manufacturer when finished goods were exported *-5 *T*-4 *T*-2 .
" When <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> went to Beijing *PRO*-1 to negotiate *T*-2 , " recalls *?* <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> , " <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> asked cadres in the foreign trade office *PRO*-3 to consider the impact of the tax on the electronics industry .
Profit margins are at best 3 - 5 % .
How can manufacturers afford *PRO*-1 to pay a 17 % import tax *T*-2 ? "
In June of last year the PRC authorities announced <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the " Document # 35 " rules</COREF> .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> stipulated that <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">companies</COREF> would be given *-1 grades according to the quantity of <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> exports and <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> records of *PRO* breaking customs regulations .
<COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">Those meriting only a B</COREF> would <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> *-1 to offer a deposit of 40 - 50 % against the value of <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> raw material imports .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> terrified <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> .
According to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD 's</COREF> statistics , 75 % of the Taiwanese firms were given *-1 Bs .
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">The announcement</COREF> caused quite a stir , but <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> effect on Taiwanese investment is as yet unclear .
In August of last year , as the mainland customs authorities took aggressive moves against smuggling , 12 <COREF ID="ectb_1009-part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> business people in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> were detained *-1 .
The charges ran the gamut from *PRO* not filling out proper forms to *PRO* purchasing <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">phony export contracts</COREF> and trying *PRO* to pass <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> off to customs .
<COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">Seven business people</COREF> were arrested *-1 and charged *-1 with smuggling and are still in jail .
" <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm constantly thinking about <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm meditating and have gone vegetarian , but <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm still not at peace , " <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> says *T*-1 .
On <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> , the highest penalty for smuggling is death .
" Last year <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> sent nine customs officers to the firing squad , " notes *T*-1 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> .
The fate of these Taiwanese businessmen will depend entirely on <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland 's</COREF> political climate .

Whether <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> arrival was by accident or design , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">a new age for Taiwanese firms in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF></COREF> is here .
It is a far cry from the days when <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms enjoyed tremendous advantages *T*-1 .
From the various revisions to trade law adopted * by <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> last year , Chang Han - wen extrapolates that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> both wants *PRO*-1 to protect <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> uncompetitive state firms and turn from low - tech processing to high - tech production .
" This is because <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">state enterprises</COREF> pressure <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> with appeals about <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> right to survival , " <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> says *T*-1 .
When <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">foreign firms in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF></COREF> are confronted *-1 with threats to <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> safety and property *T*-2 , " Hong Kong can count on the cooperation of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">US and Japanese businesses</COREF> can turn to <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ambassadors , but what can <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms</COREF> do *T*-4 ? " asks *T*-3 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can help each other .
Currently , more than 80 % of the 3,000 Taiwanese firms in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> have joined <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD</COREF> .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD</COREF> has 29 local branches in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> and is , moreover , the only <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> business association in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> with a women 's division .
Major companies listed * on the TAIEX , including Lite - on Electronics and Delta Electronics , are members of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD</COREF> .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is the largest and strongest of all Taiwan business groups on <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> both in terms of organization and operations .
Many Taiwanese believe that at a time of cross-strait tension , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms</COREF> have made <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own decisions *PRO* to invest in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> and therefore should bear the risk <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> too .
And by *PRO* investing <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> money , technology and so forth on <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> , are <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> not to some degree abandoning <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD</COREF> takes issue with this view .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">H.D. Yeh</COREF> points out that in 1998 <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> had an overall trade surplus of US$ 5.9 billion *U* , and a surplus of US$ 12.76 billion *U* with <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> .
If not for <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> trade with <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> , therefore , <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> would have had a trade deficit .
" <COREF ID="ectb_1009.part-007-E1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> make <COREF ID="ectb_1009.part-007-E1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> money here , but <COREF ID="ectb_1009.part-007-E1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> pay taxes in <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">most of <COREF ID="ectb_1009.part-007-E1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> families and children</COREF> do most of <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> consumer spending in <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , " insists *T*-1 <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD</COREF> chairperson Chang Mei - liang</COREF> .
<COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> notes that after the major earthquake in <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> on September 21 , <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> business associations throughout <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> contributed NT$ 60 million *U* .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD</COREF> contributed NT$ 30 million *U* all by <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> .
Hence , <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> argues that it *EXP*-1 's very unfair *PRO* to say that Taiwanese businesses in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> are n't contributing to <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .

And for that matter how is <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC government</COREF> looking at the Taiwanese in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD 's</COREF> spiritual leader H.D. Yeh</COREF> often goes to Beijing *PRO*-1 to represent <COREF ID="ectb_1009.part-008-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms in negotiations with <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> .
Once , in the presence of many Communist Party cadres , a high - ranking official of the State Council 's Taiwan Affairs Office asked <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">this question</COREF> : " <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> 've gathered <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">so many <COREF ID="ectb_1009.part-008-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms</COREF> in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> and stirred up such enthusiasm among <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> - but for what purpose ? "
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> threw <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> for a loop .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> is still trying *PRO*-1 to figure out what the mainland authorities think *T*-2 of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">TBAD</COREF> .
For <COREF ID="ectb_1009.part-008-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Dongguan</COREF> , *PRO* investing in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> is a road of no return .

<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mainland China</COREF> shares the same language as <COREF ID="ectb_1009.part-008-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> offers attractive investment conditions .
