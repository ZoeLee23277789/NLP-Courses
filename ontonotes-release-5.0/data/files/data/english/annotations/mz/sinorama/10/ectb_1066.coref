King of <COREF ID="295" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> Snakes
- The Hundred - Pace Viper
-LRB- Chang Chin - ju / tr. * by Robert Taylor -RRB-
*PRO* To mark the advent of the Year of the Snake , Taiuan Publishing invited the Taiwanese public *PRO*-1 to vote for native animals *PRO* to represent the 12 creatures of the Chinese zodiac .
Although <COREF ID="295" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has over 50 snake species , by far the most popular choice for the snake was the hundred - pace viper .
Why is <COREF ID="300" TYPE="IDENT">the hundred - pacer</COREF> seen *-1 as the quintessential Taiwanese snake *T*-2 ?
And how much do we know *T*-1 about <COREF ID="300" TYPE="IDENT">this endangered species which *T*-2 has been designated *-2 *PRO*-2 a " rare cultural resource "</COREF> ?
" Every day at dusk , <COREF ID="314" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> heard <COREF ID="315" TYPE="IDENT">a loud whistling sound</COREF> from far off in the forest .
The old folk told <COREF ID="314" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="315" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was the voice of the hundred - pacer . . . . "
In Academia Sinica researcher Hu Tai - li 's documentary film Sounds of Love and Sorrow , released * last year , about the life of <COREF ID="ectb_1066-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="336" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">veteran Paiwan nose - flautist Remaleg</COREF> <COREF ID="336" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">-LRB- Chiang Chung - hsin -RRB-</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-000-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="ectb_1066-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Remaleg 's</COREF> son Lavuras</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-000-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">-LRB- Chiang Cheng - hsin -RRB-</COREF></COREF> recalls <COREF ID="342" TYPE="IDENT">the poignantly beautiful sound of the hundred - pace viper as <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> heard <COREF ID="342" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> childhood in <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> old tribal village</COREF> .
<COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also recounts that it was *PRO* to imitate the sound of the hundred - pacer that the Paiwan developed the nose - flute *T*-1 .
Traditional Paiwan beliefs include many spirits .
The hundred - pace viper represents <COREF ID="362" TYPE="IDENT">a guardian spirit who *T*-1 protects <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">the Paiwan</COREF> in <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> homeland around <COREF ID="368" TYPE="IDENT">Mt. Tawu</COREF></COREF> .
" <COREF ID="362" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is the spirit of life , the greatest of all the spirits . "
<COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">Lavuras</COREF> says that 60 % of Paiwan folk tales have *-1 to do with the hundred - pacer .
In the Paiwan village of Pingho , one of the two most important festivals was the Hundred - Pacer Festival , which *T*-1 used *-1 to be held *-1 once every ten years .
" In our old village , the big tree under which the hundred - pacers lay *PRO*-4 coiled up *T*-1 was respected *-2 like a temple , and was seen *-2 as the seat of the tribe 's soul , " <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">Lavuras</COREF> recalls *T*-3 .
According to aboriginal beliefs , the only way 0 human beings can live safely on this earth *T*-1 is in a long - term relationship of friendship , mutual sacrifice and mutual support with the animals .
<COREF ID="421" TYPE="IDENT">The Paiwan images of <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-000-E12" TYPE="IDENT">the hundred - pace viper</COREF> in <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">Lavuras '</COREF> mind</COREF> have never been menacing or sinister ; <COREF ID="421" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are mostly charming and beautiful .
" Perhaps today we no longer believe in <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-000-E12" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> as spirits , but <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-000-E12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are still important symbols for the people of <COREF ID="368" TYPE="IDENT">Mt. Tawu</COREF> . "
Other Taiwanese aboriginal peoples with a close relationship to the hundred - pacer are <COREF ID="446" TYPE="IDENT">the Bunun</COREF> and the Rukai .
<COREF ID="446" TYPE="IDENT">The Bunun</COREF> call the snake *PRO*-1 kaviiad , meaning " friend . "
According to <COREF ID="446" TYPE="IDENT">Bunun</COREF> lore , if one meets <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-000-E10" TYPE="IDENT">a hundred - pacer</COREF> one need only wave a red cloth at <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-000-E10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-000-E10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will go away .

Taiwan 's top five
However , among the Han Chinese , the hundred - pace viper is seen *-1 merely as a first - rate tonic medicine 0 *T*-2 to boost male sexual powers .
Paiwan poet Monaneng has written : " <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The hundred - pacer</COREF> is dead ; / They 've put <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in a big transparent medicine jar / With ' aphrodisiac ' on the label , / *PRO* To tempt men wandering among back street red lights . / <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The hundred - pacer of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> fairytales</COREF> is dead ; / <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">We Paiwan</COREF> worshipped <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> eggs as <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> ancestors , / But now they 've put <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in a medicine jar / As a tool 0 *T*-1 to excite urban lust . . . . "
The human tradition of *PRO* eating snakes and using snakes for medicinal purposes goes back a long way .
In <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">subtropical Taiwan</COREF> , with <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> many native snakes , there were once snake research institutes and snake shops everywhere , and people made use of all kinds of snake products - snake meat , snake blood , snake penis , snake skin , and snake venom .
The notions that one can best " fight poison with poison , " and that *PRO* the more powerful 0 <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">a poison</COREF> *?* *T*-1 , the greater <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> tonic effect *?* *T*-2 , have long made poisonous snakes into highly valued natural products .

One in five of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> 50 - odd species of land snakes are poisonous .
The five best known and most frequently exploited * are <COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Taiwan habu</COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- Trimeresurus mucrosquamatus -RRB-</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Taiwan cobra</COREF> <COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- Naja naja atra -RRB-</COREF> , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Chinese green tree viper</COREF> <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- Trimeresurus stejnegeri -RRB-</COREF> , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Taiwan banded krait</COREF> <COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- Bungarus multicinctus -RRB-</COREF> and <COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the hundred - pace viper</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Deinagkistrodon acutus</COREF> , aka the sharp - nosed pit viper -RRB- .
Most of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> venomous snakes live in low - altitude farmland and sparsely populated countryside .
But <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the hundred - pace viper , which *T*-1 was never very numerous</COREF> , is at home in densely forested areas at low to medium elevations in the mountains of eastern , central and southern Taiwan .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> grows to one - and - a - half meters or more - much the same length as the habu and cobra - but *PRO*-1 being far thicker and meatier <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is much valued *-1 by gourmands .
Since <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-002-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the snake</COREF> is also sought after *-1 for <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-002-E3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> venom , <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-002-E3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> commands tremendously high prices .
According to the report " A Survey of the Commercial Exploitation and Hunting of Taiwanese Snakes " by Lin Hua - ching of Taipei Zoo , hundred - pace vipers sell for three times as much as <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> other poisonous snakes , and have been known *-1 to fetch upward of NT$ 10,000 *U* per <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">catty</COREF> <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- 600 grams -RRB-</COREF> .
During <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> period under Japanese rule , injuries caused * by poisonous snakes were a frequent occurrence , so in the 1930s Tu Tsung - ming of Taihoku Imperial -LRB- later National Taiwan -RRB- University Medical College began *-1 studying poisonous snakes , and started a trend of research into snake venom antiserums .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Snake venoms</COREF> contain complex combinations of enzymes , and as well as *PRO*-1 being useful for the treatment of snakebite , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have also been used *-1 as the basis for *PRO* developing many new medical drugs such as anticoagulants and anesthetics .
But due to <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> complexity , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">snake venoms</COREF> are not easily synthesized *-1 , so <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-2 to be milked *-2 directly from snakes .
According to medical records of the time <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-002-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the hundred - pace viper</COREF> caused more deaths than any other Taiwanese snake , so <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-002-E4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> became an important research topic .
Lavuras recalls that the largest numbers of hundred - pace vipers were caught *-1 in the period from the 1960s to the 1980s .
As the fingers of development pushed up into <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> mountains and forests , hundred - pacers were forced *-1 into retreat everywhere , and in 1989 the Council of Agriculture put the snake on the endangered species list .
The hundred - pacer is also the only snake species on the Council for Cultural Affairs ' list of 23 rare cultural resources .
Since then the popular custom of *PRO* eating hundred - pacers has gradually declined , and by 1999 the number of hundred - pacers which the Department of Health 's <COREF ID="178" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Center for Disease Control</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="178" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">CDC</COREF> -RRB- applied *PRO*-1 to have caught *T*-2 *PRO* to make antiserum had also fallen to 30 .

Regal style
But is the hundred - pacer really the most fearsome cold - blooded killer of all <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> poisonous snakes ?
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen Tsun - kuan</COREF> , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a section chief at the CDC</COREF> , states that among <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> " top five " poisonous snakes , <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the hundred - pacer</COREF> in fact has the weakest venom .
But <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> fangs are especially long , and <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> secretes the largest quantity of venom of any Taiwanese snake .
However , <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the hundred - pacer</COREF> lives in the dark depths of the dense jungle , and <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> numbers are relatively small .
Not only does it *EXP*-1 take a goodly portion of luck for a snake hunter to find a hundred - pacer - the number of people unfortunate enough *PRO* to be bitten * by one is also very small .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">One mountain lover who *T*-1 often encounters snakes on <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hiking expeditions</COREF> describes the hundred - pacer as " cool , calm and collected , " and people who *T*-2 have kept or observed <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E4" TYPE="IDENT">hundred - pacers</COREF> also say 0 <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> " do n't lash out blindly . "
Hu Tai - li describes <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> as " really the chieftain among snakes - <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">a serene , tolerant nature</COREF> , and are not apt * to attack people wantonly . "
Perhaps it is because of <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">this regal temperament</COREF> that <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are revered *-1 as ancestral spirits by the Paiwan *T*-2 .
The hundred - pacer belongs to the viper family , which *T*-1 was the last of the snake families 0 *T*-2 to evolve .
Unlike the more primitive pythons and blind snakes , the vipers all have venom glands .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Tu Ming - chang of the biology department at National Taiwan Normal University</COREF> explains that <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">snakes</COREF> evolved from hole - dwelling animals , and *PRO*-1 lacking limbs , <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are less agile than most quadrupeds .
<COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> vision and hearing are also poor .
Hence <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> poison fangs are almost the only tools 0 <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *T*-1 0 *PRO* to catch food *RNR*-3 and defend <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> *RNR*-3 with *T*-2 .
In recent years , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Tu</COREF> and <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> research students have gradually researched the ecology of the viper species Trimeresurus gracilis , which *T*-1 is endemic to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and of the Chinese green tree viper .
But few researchers have taken an interest in <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E7" TYPE="IDENT">the hundred - pacer , which *T*-1 lives deep in the forest and has limited distribution</COREF> .
Although <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is an endangered species , lack of detailed information about such things as <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-003-E7" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> reproductive cycle , preferred prey , range of activity and habits turns conservation efforts into little more than empty talk .

Cold - blooded ?
Not me !
It was only when <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei Zoo</COREF> began a hundred - pacer breeding program *T*-1 that people had the opportunity *PRO* to understand the true face of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> hundred - pace vipers *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lin Hua - ching</COREF> , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">curator of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the zoo 's</COREF> rescue center for amphibians and reptiles</COREF></COREF> , says that the year before last there were six hundred - pacers in the rescue center which *T*-1 had been confiscated *-1 from a snake shop in Panchiao .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Zoo staff</COREF> felt that not enough *ICH*-5 was known *-1 about <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the snakes '</COREF> habits for <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to be successfully released *-2 back into the wild , and in order *PRO* to have some substantive educational content 0 *PRO* to show *T*-3 visitors , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> decided *PRO*-4 to start a breeding program .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">" Snake Daddy " Lin Hua - ching</COREF> says that as far as *PRO* is known * from observation of <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">snakes</COREF> in the wild , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> live largely solitary lives .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> sense of smell is an important means of communication , and in the breeding season male snakes are attracted *-1 by scents released * by the females .
In late October 1999 , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the zoo</COREF> began *-1 putting the male and female hundred - pacers together in pairs , and <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">one pair</COREF> took a liking to each other .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">The male</COREF> gently courted <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the female</COREF> by *PRO* licking <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> head with <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> tongue .
For the next three weeks *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the couple</COREF> were inseparable , after which <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> gradually returned to <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> solitary lifestyles *T*-2 .
In February of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the female snake 's</COREF> belly gradually began *-1 to swell , and an ultrasound examination confirmed 0 <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was pregnant .
In the two weeks after <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> laid <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> eggs</COREF> , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the female hundred - pacer</COREF> protected <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> vigorously .
*PRO*-1 Not daring *PRO*-1 to anger <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the zoo staff</COREF> waited for <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> maternal instincts to subside somewhat before *PRO* removing <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the eggs</COREF> .
In August <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> , as <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was being buffeted *-1 by a typhoon , over 20 eggs hatched out into tiny snakes , which <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the zoo</COREF> hopes *T*-2 can grow up safe and sound .
During this first breeding session , for fear of anything going wrong with the pregnancy <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the zoo staff</COREF> disturbed <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the mother snake</COREF> as little as possible .
But <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Hua - ching</COREF> says that next time around <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will gather more detailed data , such as *PRO* weighing <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the female snake</COREF> every week , *PRO* to make a comprehensive record of the breeding process .

*PRO* Hear the hundred - pacer 's voice
However , no matter how many <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-005-E4" TYPE="IDENT">hundred - pacers</COREF> we can *T*-1 see at the zoo on future visits , it *EXP*-2 is obvious that we can not fully understand <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-005-E4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> just by *PRO* seeing <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-005-E4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in captivity .
When <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Lavuras</COREF> mentioned at a Symposium on Amphibian and Reptile Ecology and Conservation held * by Taipei Zoo last year that <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the Paiwan</COREF> used <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> nose - flutes *PRO*-2 to imitate the voice of the hundred - pace viper *T*-1 , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">all the biologists present</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had never heard a hundred - pacer make a sound .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Lavuras</COREF> asked <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the scholars</COREF> bluntly where <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had <COREF ID="ectb_1066-part-005-E1" TYPE="IDENT">seen</COREF> hundred - pacers *T*-1 .
If <COREF ID="ectb_1066-part-005-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was in the zoo , <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-005-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the snakes</COREF> were away from <COREF ID="ectb_1066.part-005-E3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> natural environment .
But even if <COREF ID="ectb_1066-part-005-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was in the wild , with the great environmental changes of modern times the snakes might have been " struck *-1 dumb " too !
Whether hundred - pacers really do have a voice is an unanswered question of biology .
But perhaps <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the aborigines '</COREF> open attitude toward *RNR*-1 and involvement in *RNR*-1 the natural world , as *PRO* revealed * in <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> legend of the nose flute , is something even harder *PRO* to imagine for modern people who *T*-3 received a rationalist education and operate in a mechanized culture .
Perhaps in this Year of the Snake , the hundred - pacer , just like <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the Paiwan people</COREF> who *T*-1 also still live in close communion with nature , is singing us some long - forgotten songs of life - if only you are willing *PRO* to listen with your soul .
