On <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">April 24</COREF> <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">finalized</COREF> <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="205" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the chief task of <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">the sixth round of constitutional revisions during Lee Teng - hui 's presidency</COREF></COREF> : <COREF ID="205" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own demobilization</COREF></COREF> .
While <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">this development</COREF> will allay popular fears of an everlasting National Assembly , how *PRO* to formulate comprehensive measures *PRO* to fill in the constitutional and functional void of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the moribund body</COREF> *T*-1 becomes the next vital task .
On March 24 , just days after the ROC presidential election , <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">the Council of Grand Justices</COREF> made <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">a constitutional interpretation of <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">last year 's <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">National Assembly</COREF> term extension</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-9 declaring <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">the move</COREF> null and void .
<COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> stirred the ire of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">National Assembly</COREF> members , who *T*-9 <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">struck</COREF> back during the ensuing constitutional revision session , *PRO*-9 claiming that " lifelong privileges for grand justices violate the constitution . "
<COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">The reaction by a minority of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">NA</COREF> delegates to <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">the grand justices '</COREF> constitutional interpretation</COREF></COREF> once again triggered displeasure in society at <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the body 's</COREF> refusal *PRO* to admit <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> fallibility .
Activists in groups such as the Taipei Society and the Association of Taiwanese University Professors organized a street demonstration *PRO*-9 to call for <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the dissolution of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF></COREF> .
A further consequence of <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">the grand justices '</COREF> ruling was that an election would have *-1 to be <COREF ID="288" TYPE="IDENT">held</COREF> *-1 *PRO* to produce a new <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">National Assembly</COREF> membership before the conclusion of the current term .
While <COREF ID="288" TYPE="IDENT">this development</COREF> had would - be candidates in all parties scrambling *PRO*-1 to launch election campaigns , by late March the post-presidential-election situation , combined * with pressure from public opinion , pushed <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT</COREF> *PRO*-2 to work with <COREF ID="302" TYPE="IDENT">the DPP</COREF> on means 0 *PRO* to phase out <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> *T*-9 , despite <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT 's</COREF> previous opposition to <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the body 's</COREF> complete dissolution</COREF> in the name of *PRO* preserving the constitutional structure .
For a time , the question of whether *PRO* to hold elections for <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> , as well as the <COREF ID="302" TYPE="IDENT">DPP</COREF> and <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">KMT</COREF> 's shared policy for *PRO* phasing out <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> , were viewed *-1 as *PRO*-1 motivated *-1 by fear of the growth of <COREF ID="336" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the People First Party</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="337" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">PFP</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> .
Thus the hubbub *ICH*-1 continued over the fate of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> for a fortnight , until finally the newly formed <COREF ID="336" TYPE="IDENT">PFP</COREF> caucus in <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the assembly</COREF> <COREF ID="348" TYPE="IDENT">agreed</COREF> to <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> gradual downsizing .
<COREF ID="348" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> paved the way for the commencement on April 8 of <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">the sixth round of constitutional revisions in recent years , in which such issues as *PRO* reducing the total number of <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">NA</COREF> delegates</COREF> and freezing <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> powers and duties - *PRO* amounting to <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> " self - abolition " - became the center of discussion *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT">The various parties</COREF> leveraged <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> carrots and sticks against <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> delegates , *PRO*-9 threatening expulsion for *PRO* not supporting <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the neutralization of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF></COREF> at the same time as <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> tried *PRO*-1 to appease <COREF ID="371" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> delegates .
Finally , on <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">April 24</COREF> these maneuvers helped bring about the passage of <COREF ID="389" TYPE="IDENT">several constitutional revisions , including <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">deactivation of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF></COREF> , favorable provisions for residents of <COREF ID="402" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Taiwan 's offshore islands</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="402" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Kinmen , Matsu , and Penghu</COREF> -RRB- and military personnel , and revocation of lifelong special privileges for grand justices</COREF> .
In line with <COREF ID="389" TYPE="IDENT">these revisions</COREF> , the voting public will no longer directly elect <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">NA</COREF> delegates .
Rather , <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> will <COREF ID="439" TYPE="IDENT">become</COREF> a " task - based body " generated * according to proportional political party representation in the legislature , maintaining the rights to ratification of constitutional revisions proposed * by the Legislative Yuan , impeachment of the president and vice president , and resolutions on modifications to national territory .
With <COREF ID="439" TYPE="IDENT">these changes</COREF> , legislators will exercise approval over personnel appointments to the Judicial , Examination and Control yuans .

*PRO* To be fair , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> does have <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> unique set of duties and powers under the existing structure , thus few people are ready *PRO*-1 to call for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> complete abolition .
This is especially notable given the ambiguity of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> constitutional structure</COREF> , *PRO* seeing as <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not a presidential system , a cabinet system , or a two - headed system in the true sense .
Many scholars caution that *PRO* eliminating <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> and handing all <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> powers to the Legislative Yuan , while the government structure remains ambiguous , is not the best structural framework .
That said *-1 , despite landmark changes such as the full election of the national parliament in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and establishment of the legal groundwork for the direct election of the <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">ROC</COREF> president , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">ROC</COREF> Constitution</COREF> has been revamped *-9 with alarming frequency over the past few years .
In fact , some have scoffed that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution , the basis upon which <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the nation 's</COREF> laws are founded *-1 *T*-3</COREF> , has been tinkered with *-2 more often than the civil and criminal codes .
Further , new duties and authorities were given *-9 to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> in order *PRO* to achieve successive constitutional revisions .
For instance , in exchange for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the assembly</COREF> agreeing *PRO*-9 to give up <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> authority *PRO* to elect the president , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> was given *-1 power of approval over personnel appointments to the Judicial Yuan , Examination Yuan , and Control Yuan .
With each revision , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> became increasingly jumbled , while <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">NA</COREF> delegates</COREF> leveraged <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> positions *PRO*-9 to exact " constitutional amendment rent " and fatten <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> up .

Last year 's term extension bill further solidified the public 's image of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> as no more than a tool of political struggle , and a self - indulgent body at that , *PRO*-9 generating widespread consensus on the necessity of *PRO* <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">dissolving</COREF> <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
While the latest round of constitutional revisions satisfies the general desire *ICH*-2 across the political spectrum *PRO* to progressively <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">dismantle</COREF> <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> , sloppy accompanying provisions and the failure *ICH*-1 of the various political parties *PRO* to propose a new blueprint in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> place provide cause for new concern over the health of constitutional government in <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF> .
For example , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> will become a " task - based body " generated * according to the proportion of seats held * by each political party in the legislature .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">National Taiwan University professor Lee Hung - hsi</COREF> , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">an expert on constitutional law</COREF> , points out that less than 10 % of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwanese population</COREF> takes part in political party activities .
Thus a National Assembly generated * proportionally according to party representation represents suppression of the views of the other 90 % of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the population</COREF> , and thus violates the principle of *PRO* vesting authority over constitutional government in the people .
Following <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the demobilization of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF></COREF> , many functions and powers currently held * by <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> will be <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">transferred</COREF> *-9 to <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the Legislative Yuan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> in turn raises fears *ICH*-1 in the academic community that <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the Legislative Yuan</COREF> could become an untamable new constitutional monster .
The expanded powers of <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the Legislative Yuan</COREF> also include the impeachment and recall of the president and vice president , and the supplementary election of the vice president .
These changes tighten the relationship between <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the parliament</COREF> and the president , *PRO*-9 requiring the president *PRO*-1 to report to <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the Legislative Yuan</COREF> on the state of <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> .
But the president has only the passive authority *PRO* to dissolve <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the parliament</COREF> .
In the face of a parliament with supreme powers , <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">a president whose party *T*-1 claims only a minority in the legislature</COREF> is powerless *PRO*-5 even to replace a premier with whom <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does not see eye to eye *T*-3 , *PRO* leaving <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-4 devoid of the authorities and responsibilities 0 *T*-2 to correspond with <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> administrative actions .
A China Times editorial urged that the question of whether <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the enormous Legislative Yuan</COREF> might be split *-1 into two houses by function be evaluated *-9 and worked *-9 out as soon as possible .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The legal demobilization of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF></COREF> was conducted *-9 without a hitch , yet the future of constitutional government <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">looks</COREF> bleak .
<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">This dire outlook</COREF> is surely not something 0 <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> political parties</COREF> expected *T*-9 when , *PRO*-1 attempting *PRO*-1 to align with public opinion , <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> moved *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">phase</COREF> out <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the National Assembly</COREF> *T*-2 .
