- Life in Middle Age

<COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">Middle age</COREF> is the most awkward time .
<COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's the age when you ca n't get to sleep till dawn *T*-1 .
The age of sighs but not passion .
The age of sorrow but not anger .
In <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">middle age</COREF> , you kiss girls on the forehead , not the lips .
<COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's the age when you drink strong coffee and take stomach pills *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">The age</COREF> when the phrase " you ca n't escape convention " says it all *T*-1 .
Middle age is afternoon tea .
-LRB- From " Middle Age Is Afternoon Tea , " by Tung Chiao -RRB-
" Middle age is the afternoon , but <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't say 0 <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have much time 0 *PRO* to drink tea *T*-1 ! "
*PRO*-1 Sitting in the silence of <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> research office , <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Li Liang - che of the psychology department at National Chengchi University</COREF> appears *-1 pensive .
Indeed , *PRO* passing 40 is like *PRO* passing noon .
You miss the fresh , pure , carefree feeling of morning , and the arrogance of noon , yet also yearn for the serene splendor of the sunset .
It is only now , in the afternoon , that worries crowd in , and *PRO* try as you might *?* you can not raise your flagging spirits *T*-1 .
Worries , ennui - is this a case of that fashionable disease of civilization , the " midlife crisis " ?
" If you 're going *-1 to have <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">a crisis</COREF> , <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's most likely * to happen during the " midlife transition , " from 40 to 45 , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">Li</COREF> .
In people of a melancholy and sensitive disposition , or who *T*-3 have faced many setbacks early in life , <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> may even set in around the age of 35 .
" In the US , 35 is the maximum age for *PRO* being in a fraternity , " jokes *T*-1 National Taiwan Normal University audiovisual center director Chao Ning , who *T*-2 is known *-2 as a " wunderkind " in the broadcasting world .
After that , your moods begin *-3 to seesaw between those of " youth " and " middle age . "
You are perfectly sure that you are in as good form as ever , and have not even reached your peak yet , but *PRO* looking at <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">all those talented youngsters around you</COREF> , <COREF ID="309" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> seem *-1 even more outstanding than yourself , and more like tomorrow 's rising stars .
A vexing feeling of *PRO* being pushed * along by the years gradually builds up , until one day you find yourself high and dry on the shoals of life .

Middle age creeps up on you
" The new waves on the Yangtze River push the old waves along " - i.e. each generation outdoes the last - and in an age of rapid change , the sense of crisis 0 this induces *T*-1 in the older generations is amplified *-2 .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">A Mrs. Wei , who *T*-1 chose *PRO*-1 to leave <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> job as a bookkeeper five years ago because of an unexpected pregnancy</COREF> , thought at the time that with <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> ability , experience and contacts it *EXP*-2 would not be hard for <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> to find a new job once <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> child started primary school .
But as the day of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> return to the world of work draws ever nearer , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> feels a growing sense of panic .
" Most of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> old colleagues have left , and the few 0 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm still in touch with *T*-1 talk about nothing but things like Excel spreadsheets that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know nothing about *T*-2 ! "
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Wei</COREF> has hinted a few times to <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband</COREF> that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> should just stay at home and concentrate on *PRO* looking after the children .
But *PRO*-2 thinking of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband 's</COREF> grim expression whenever <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gives <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> the housekeeping money *T*-1 , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> does n't dare *PRO*-2 to say it plainly .
In today 's society , youth is beauty .
But in *PRO* trying *PRO* to show 0 <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was not out of touch with youth , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Chou</COREF> , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the 45 - year - old boss of a computer components company</COREF></COREF> , had an experience which *T*-2 left <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-3 not knowing whether *PRO* to laugh or cry .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> arranged with <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> young employees</COREF> *PRO*-2 to go for a barbecue in a river valley , *PRO*-2 hoping *PRO*-2 to get *PRO*-2 to know <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> better .
But when <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> arrived there *T*-1 , <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the workers</COREF> formed <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own groups , *PRO*-2 laughing and clowning around , and left <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-3 to get on with *PRO* barbecuing <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the meat</COREF> .
When <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was done *-2 *T*-1 - and <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was drenched *-3 in sweat - <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the young people</COREF> , attracted * by the aroma , gathered round .
But after *PRO* giving <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a few words of praise , <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wolfed down the food and scattered again immediately , as if <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't even exist .
" <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> probably thought 0 <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> old fogey of a boss</COREF> had just come *PRO*-1 to wait on <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> ! "
From then on <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Chou</COREF> , having recognized <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own place in the order of things , made no more attempts *PRO* to ingratiate <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> with <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> young employees</COREF> - and in fact felt much the more relaxed for it .

More crises in middle age ?
" By middle age , you have more experience of life , and you are sure * to have various realizations and regrets , " says *T*-1 Li Liang - che .
Even if you have no economic worries and as yet no health problems , nonetheless the flowing river of life has carried away your youth , ideals , pure love and even your loved ones , and left you with many wounds 0 you are loth *PRO* to touch *T*-1 and regrets 0 you are loth *PRO*-3 to remember *T*-2 .
The sense that the realization of past mistakes has come too late *PRO* to put them right , and of your remaining days being numbered *-1 , makes you feel despondent .
But despondency need not amount to a " crisis . "
According to overseas research , although people have more worries in middle age , only around 15 % have emotional difficulties serious enough *PRO* to require psychological counseling or medication .
Sociology professor Wang Ya - ke of National Taipei University , who *T*-1 has always been an ardent supporter of feminism and recently became the first scholar 0 *T*-2 to promote " male studies " in <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , offers the following analysis :
The real reason why the " midlife crisis " has become such a hot topic in <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> *T*-3 lies with <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the 75 million " baby boomers " born * in the postwar period from 1946 to 1964</COREF> .
One can say that <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">this huge generation</COREF> is the one with the highest level of achievement , and the most diverse set of values , in human history .
Since <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> gradually began *-1 to enter middle age in the late 1980s , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have produced many reminiscences and introspective works about <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own mental and spiritual journey , which *T*-2 have elicited a strong response .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">The US 's</COREF> present middle - aged generation</COREF> have <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">metamorphosed</COREF> from youthful anti-war protesters and hippies into yuppie managers of multinational corporations , and from idealists into materialists .
The tensions and trauma of <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">that transformation</COREF> cause <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> " midlife crisis " to be especially complex .
By contrast , although <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> had <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own baby boom from 1951 to 1966 , <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> middle - aged generation</COREF> have not had the same life experiences , so while <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> too have <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> midlife crises , <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are much less complex .
<COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Alice Lu</COREF> , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of the International Family Life Education Center</COREF></COREF> , suggests that " change " would be a better term *ICH*-1 than " crisis " for the mood swings and difficulties of middle age .
Midlife change , in fact , is a natural process in the journey of life , and as people grow older and have *-1 to shoulder ever heavier responsibilities , all kinds of pressures large and small appear together at this time of life .
For example , says *?* <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Lu</COREF> , <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">middle - aged people</COREF> are the meat in a generational sandwich .
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> aging parents increasingly need care , while at the same time <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> teenage children are at <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> most rebellious .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">Other elements in <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives , such as <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> job or marriage</COREF> , have been in existence for ten to 20 years ; the sparkle is gone , yet <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have invested too much *PRO* to just walk away from <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
And again , *PRO* turning *PRO* to look at <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> , gray hairs are sprouting from <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> temples and crows ' feet appearing at the corners of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> eyes , <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> jowls are sagging , and the thick , solid chest muscles of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> youth have somehow migrated down to <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bellies .
When <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> take <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sons out for some exercise *T*-1 , <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't even have the strength 0 *PRO* to do a single pull - up *T*-2 !
<COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">Midlife</COREF> brings many uncertainties , and if <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> comes in a time of dramatic social change when many role models are being completely rewritten *-1 *T*-2 , middle - aged people may be left *-3 even more at a loss .

Life is long , the future bleak
Li Liang - che notes that firstly , life expectancy has rapidly increased .
In Taiwan , average life expectancy has risen steadily from 55 years in 1951 to 75 today .
As the journey of life lengthens , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">middle - aged people</COREF> become more and more confused about <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> status in life .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">A Mr. Chang , who *T*-1 lives in Hualien</COREF> , is now 58 , *PRO*-2 nearing the upper end of middle age .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> recalls that when <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> parents at <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">age 60</COREF></COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were " ever so old , " and <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> seemed *-2 quite content *PRO*-2 to dandle <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> grandchildren , *PRO*-2 oblivious to the affairs of the world .
But now that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is approaching <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the same age</COREF> <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> feels 0 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is not yet qualified *PRO*-1 to call <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *PRO*-2 old , and still less to speak lightly of *PRO* retiring .
" We 're living longer , but life is more tiring ! "
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> asks , only half in jest : How come nowadays middle age seems *-1 to drag on forever *T*-2 ?
With longer lifespans and less rigid social values , patterns of living once shared * by all have been replaced *-1 by a growing diversity of individual experiences .
In middle age , some people set up successful businesses , while <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">others</COREF> lose <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> jobs and are faced *-1 with poverty ; <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">working women</COREF> find <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> squeezed *-2 between the exhausting demands of children and housework on the one hand and <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> jobs on the other , while at the same time many single women face a daily battle with loneliness .
At the age of 50 , <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">some people</COREF> already have grandchildren at <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> knee , while others are getting married for the first time .
With more and more people remaining single , rising divorce rates , growing numbers of unmarried mothers , increasing occurrence of infertility , and the emergence of large numbers of families where husband and wife live in different cities , or even - as for many expatriate Taiwanese business people - in different countries *T*-1 , many middle - aged people 's carefully laid life plans have suddenly come to nothing .

<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> ex-husband</COREF> works in Tainan , and for many years during their marriage <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> only came home at weekends .
Early last year a late - night phone call shattered the peaceful life 0 <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had worked so hard *PRO*-1 to build *T*-2 .
At the other end was *T*-1 <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">a woman who *T*-2 venomously demanded that <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Mei - lun</COREF> give up <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband</COREF> , or <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> would bring along <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> three - and - a - half - year - old illegitimate son and make a scene at the hospital</COREF> !

The unbearable anguish of being
" Actually , it 's not as if <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't have <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> suspicions all those years .
But <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> never thought 0 things would turn out *-1 so awful !
How could <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have been such a fool *T*-1 ? "
For the next six months , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Mei - lun</COREF> could hardly sleep or eat .
By day <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> dragged <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> to work like a zombie , but in the middle of the night <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> would wake with a start , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> heart pounding so hard 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could n't breathe .
The affair finally ended in divorce , but the upside is that since then <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> ex</COREF> has actually behaved better , for <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has begun *-1 to commute back to Kaohsiung from Tainan every day , and is much more patient *ICH*-2 with <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son and daughter than before .
At present they are planning *PRO*-1 to remarry , but <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> worries that once <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband</COREF> is again bound *-2 by the chains of marriage , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might return to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> old ways .
" Life in middle age is like *PRO* trying *PRO* to put together a jigsaw puzzle in a gale .
The more 0 you look at <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the parts 0 you 've already assembled *T*-1</COREF> *T*-2 , the more disjointed and ugly <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> seem *-6 *T*-3 ; but it 's <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the parts 0 you ca n't finish *T*-4</COREF> that you long for *T*-5 more and more , even though you know 0 there 's precious little hope 0 you 'll ever get <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> done *-7 . "
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Lin , who *T*-1 turned *-1 40 this year</COREF> , says with an air of resignation that if a gust of wind blows the whole puzzle away , the sense of dismay and panic at *PRO* being tricked * by fate can drive you to distraction .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Mei - lun 's</COREF> mother often <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">comes</COREF> *PRO*-1 to stay , and <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> has done much *PRO* to lighten the burden of *PRO* running <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> household .
But many people who *T*-1 arrive in middle age without the support of a family can only try *PRO*-2 to weather life 's storms alone .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chiang , still single at 46</COREF> , is an example .
When <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> worked as a PR manager for foreign companies such as Hewlett - Packard and Texas Instruments *T*-1 , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was always the highly effective superwoman .
But <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> realized that under the dual pressure of <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> need for career success and <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> unfulfilled emotional needs , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was approaching a state of psychological collapse .
Two years ago , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> became seriously depressed .
At night <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> would toss and turn in bed , but the worry that lack of sleep would make <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> unable *PRO*-2 to get up in the morning and would affect <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> work performance made <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> even less able *PRO*-1 to sleep .
Years of *PRO* looking at a computer screen was causing <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> vision to deteriorate rapidly , and due to *PRO* working in a sealed high - tech office <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was always dogged *-1 by colds , so that every day <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> felt under the weather .

*PRO* Live for today
" <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> asked <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF> , do <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> really want *PRO*-1 to carry on like this ?
What *ICH*-2 *T*-1 matters more , your work or your health ? "
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chiang</COREF> had accumulated some savings during <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> many years at work , but for the first three months after <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> resigned <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> job <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could not help a sense of panic , *PRO*-1 feeling anxious that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> might be cast *-2 out by society , and also fearing the accusing looks of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> friends and family .
But gradually <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> began *PRO*-1 to learn *PRO*-2 to relax and let go .
" Zhuangzi says that life is toil and that death is the time for rest , but <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't believe all that .
It should n't be that way ! "
After three months , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chiang</COREF> no longer put <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> under pressure , and no longer got worked up about other people 's well - meaning advice .
Once <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> stopped *-1 having *-1 to get up early *PRO*-1 to go to work , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> anxiety about insomnia decreased greatly , and when <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was able *PRO*-2 to adjust <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> living habits according to <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> own needs *T*-3 , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> depression</COREF> cleared up by <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> began *-1 decorating <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> flat , going to the gym , and cooking the food 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> likes *T*-2 , and even just sitting *PRO* lost * in thought , enjoying the empty spaces in life .
In particular , *PRO* having freed <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> from the barren existence of a " sexless wage slave " <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> has begun *-1 to liberate <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> emotional side and enjoy the pleasure of *PRO* being a woman .
On the subject of family affection and affairs of the heart , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chiang</COREF> has also come to a realization .
" <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> mother died *PRO*-1 young , and <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> father</COREF> always regarded <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">us three children</COREF> as bloodsuckers , and never showed <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> any love . "
Because of this , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chiang</COREF> left home early *PRO*-1 to live independently .
But in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> heart , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> desire for love has never ceased .
Perhaps the shadow of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> childhood is behind the setbacks in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> love life , so that even today <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is still single .
At present , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chiang</COREF> has a boyfriend ten years <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> junior .
" <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do n't constrain each other or force each other into anything .
<COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're only together when <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> really want *PRO*-2 to be *?* *T*-1 . "

" No , not necessarily , " answers *T*-1 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">51 - year - old Hsiang Chi - tai</COREF> , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a manager at a newspaper</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-2 shaking <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> head .
For the last two years <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Hsiang Chi - tai</COREF> has been plagued *-1 with capsulitis in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> shoulder , and one morning when <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could n't manage *PRO*-2 to fasten <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> bra before *PRO* setting off for work *T*-3 , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> woke up <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> son</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a university student</COREF></COREF> , *PRO* to help <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> .

The best laid plans
Apart from those 0 *T*-1 to do with health , marriage and work , many other unexpected changes may occur in middle age .
When <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was 38 *T*-1 , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Chao Ning , who *T*-2 is now a director of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Buddhist satellite TV station</COREF> <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">LTV</COREF> and the producer of many Buddhist TV programs</COREF> , was invited *-3 to <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Houston , Texas</COREF> *PRO*-3 to give <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">a lecture</COREF> .
On the plane <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> happened *-1 to meet <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Buddhist Master Hsingyun of Foguangshan Temple</COREF> .
After 14 hours of the master earnestly speaking to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> about the principles of Buddhist life , " Even a stone would have been moved *-1 ! "
After <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Chao 's</COREF> lecture in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Houston</COREF></COREF> was over , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> immediately took a plane to Los Angeles and went to Hsi Lai Temple , which *T*-1 was just being built *-1 .
There <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> sought out <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Master Hsingyun</COREF> and declared <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> conversion to <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Buddhism</COREF> , and since then <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has never touched a drop of alcohol .
" Before that , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> always had a rhyming couplet pasted * up by <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> doorway which *T*-1 read : ' I know 0 there is wine in this world , / But not that it can make you drunk , ' which *T*-2 was <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> way of *PRO* bragging about <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> drinking prowess . "
What power *T*-1 caused <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to make such a great change ?
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Chao Ning <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> ca n't explain .
" In the US , 38 and 49 are special ages .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had come *PRO*-1 to realize many things , and when fate brought the right opportunity *T*-2 , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was ready for a change of heart , " says *T*-3 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Chao</COREF> .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> converted to <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Buddhism</COREF> at 38 , got married at " 491?2 , " and before many years had become the " super-old dad " of <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">three children</COREF> .
The changes in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Chao Ning 's</COREF> life in middle age can not be described *-1 as small .
" *PRO* Looking back , it seems that none of the road 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> took *T*-1 in life is what <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> expected *T*-2 . "
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Chao</COREF> reveals that 40 years ago when <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was taking <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> college entrance exams *T*-3 , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> put down all kinds of choices of university but deliberately did not include <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">NTNU</COREF> , because <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was not interested in *PRO* being a teacher .
But although <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did not study at <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">NTNU</COREF> , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went *PRO*-1 to teach there , and has been there for over 20 years .
" Every year <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> make a big palaver about *PRO* wanting *PRO* to plan <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> life and how <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm going *-2 to give up teaching and concentrate on broadcasting *T*-3 . "
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Chao</COREF> continues with the same forthright , sincere smile :
" But who *T*-1 'd have thought that in the blink of an eye <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> colleagues would be telling <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> : ' <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Old Chao</COREF> , you need n't bother *PRO*-3 planning , you 're soon going *-2 to retire ! ' "
Although <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> never got around to *PRO* planning <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Chao , who *T*-1 has always liked *PRO*-1 to " follow <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> feelings</COREF> , " <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">feels</COREF> that every step 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has taken *T*-2 has been steady and enriching .
Now that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is about *PRO*-1 to leave middle age for the age of wisdom , <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> causes <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to walk on eagerly , with a spring in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> step .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> only real worry is for <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> three children , now aged seven , five and two years old</COREF> .

The phrase most often on <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Chao Ning 's</COREF> lips nowadays is , " Because <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> kids</COREF> are small , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't get old just yet . "

Who *T*-1 will tell me ? !
Forty - six - what an awkward age .
The majority of these workers are carrying the tremendous burden of *PRO* being the breadwinner for three generations .
" <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">The sense of uncertainty about employment</COREF> has begun *-1 to affect every facet of life . "
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Simon Chang</COREF> says that <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a cause of marital tension , and <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">these workers</COREF> have thousands of questions sticking in <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> throats , such as : Will <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-1 to interrupt <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children 's education ?

How long a buffer period can the company give <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-1 ?
But nobody is willing *PRO*-1 to give <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> a clear answer .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> suggests that rather than <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> spending vast amounts on unemployment benefits , it *EXP*-1 would be better for <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to set up a life guidance and psychological counseling system for workers at all state - owned and private enterprises , as quickly as possible .
" What we want *T*-1 is n't money , but *NOT* clear guidance to the future ! "
" For <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">a middle - aged person</COREF> , *PRO* <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">losing</COREF> one 's job is just as traumatic as a car accident , *PRO* falling *PRO* ill , the death of a spouse or a child running away from home .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's an event beyond <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> control which *T*-1 suddenly turns <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> life *PRO*-2 upside - down . "
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chiu Chia - li</COREF> , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center</COREF> , describes this kind of occurrence as a " non-normative event . "
Such events are much more traumatic than " normative events " such as job stress , a parent being paralyzed *-3 , children growing up and leaving home , or *PRO* being passed * over for promotion , all of which *T*-2 are more predictable .
*PRO* Looking around us , there are <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">many middle - aged people who , *T*-1 although one can not say 0 <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are unemployed , do n't have a regular career</COREF> .

<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did well , and used <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> money *PRO*-1 to buy three or four shops and apartments .
In the end <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gave up <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> shop because the work became physically too demanding , but after several failed attempts in other lines of business , today <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can only live on <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> savings and the rent from <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> apartments .
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has enough *PRO*-1 to get by , but *PRO*-2 spending the whole day *PRO*-2 doing nothing <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> finds it *EXP*-3 difficult *PRO* to face the inquiring glances of neighbors .
Two years ago , *PRO*-2 encouraged *-2 by <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife , who *T*-1 works for <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">an estate agency</COREF> , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> went on <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">a pre-work training course at <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the agency</COREF></COREF> .

Finally , after *PRO* sticking it out for a month , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> quit <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">the job</COREF> on *PRO* receiving <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first pay packet .
" There are many things which young people can do *T*-1 without any inhibitions , but in middle age you build yourself all kinds of high walls which *T*-2 are very hard 0 *PRO* to escape from *T*-3 . "

After *PRO* leaving <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Chiu</COREF> found a school in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> where most of the students were about <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> age *T*-2 .
