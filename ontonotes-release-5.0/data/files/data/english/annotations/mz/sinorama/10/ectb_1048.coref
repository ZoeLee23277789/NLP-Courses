The winner of <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1048-part-000-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the prize for fine art in last year 's National Culture and Arts Foundation Awards</COREF> - <COREF ID="ectb_1048-part-000-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the highest honors for an artist in <COREF ID="ectb_1048-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> -</COREF> was <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">contemporary painter Hsia Yang</COREF> .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> first became a leading light on the <COREF ID="ectb_1048-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> art scene back in the 1950s , as one of the " Eight Great Outlaws " who *T*-1 launched <COREF ID="ectb_1048-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the island 's</COREF> modern art movement .
Since then <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> artistic vocation has taken <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> around the world , and <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has at last ended up *-1 back in <COREF ID="ectb_1048-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
What is *T*-2 it that *T*-1 distinguishes <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia 's</COREF> work and that *T*-3 marked <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> out for <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the National Arts and Culture award</COREF> , and what kind of contribution has <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made *T*-4 to contemporary art in <COREF ID="ectb_1048-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> ?
*PRO*-1 Friendly and relaxed by nature , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia Yang</COREF> does n't seem *-1 overly excited about *PRO* winning <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the National Culture and Arts Award</COREF> .
If anything it is <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> friends who *T*-1 are happiest , *PRO*-1 relieved *PRO*-1 to see <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> gaining deserved recognition for the achievements of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> peripatetic , ill - starred life .

Lonely start in life
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia Tzu - hsiang</COREF> , as <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was then named *-1 *PRO*-1 *?* , was born *-2 into <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">a literary family</COREF> in Hunan Province .
Fate robbed <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother within a week of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> birth , and of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father when <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was just four *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> grandmother</COREF> took <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to Sichuan *PRO* to escape the war , and they returned a couple of years later *PRO* to find the family home in ruins .
When <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was nine *T*-1 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> grandmother</COREF> died and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was entrusted *-2 to <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">a great aunt</COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> in turn died when <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> was 13 *T*-1 , after which <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went *PRO*-3 to live with <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">an uncle and aunt</COREF> in Hankou *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to send <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to join <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> elder brother</COREF> in Changsha , but <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> brother</COREF> did n't have the means 0 *PRO* to take care of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-2 either .
At the age of 16 , after years of *PRO* being passed * from pillar to post , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> joined the army - where at least <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knew that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'd get fed *-2 *T*-3 .
" <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a big clan , and <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> just fell apart ! " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> with <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-001-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a rueful smile</COREF> , <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-001-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the expression of one who *T*-2 has seen life and holds few illusions</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> joined up in the year that the Nationalist forces retreated from the mainland *T*-1 , and soon found <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> in a desk job at Air Force General HQ in <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
By coincidence , the dormitory bunk above <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> was occupied *-1 by <COREF ID="104" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">another aspiring painter</COREF> , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wu Hao</COREF> .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">The two</COREF> became firm friends and began *-1 to take classes under <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="112" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Li Chung - sheng</COREF> , <COREF ID="112" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the doyen of modern art in <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
At <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Li 's</COREF> Antung Street Studio</COREF> <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> teamed up with a group of like - minded young painters , including Ouyang Wen - yuan , Huo Kang , Hsiao Chin , Li Yuan - chia , Chen Tao - ming and Hsiao Ming - hsien .
Together <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> formed the Ton - Fan Group , and eventually <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> became known *-1 as the " Eight Great Outlaws " of Taiwanese modern art .
As <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> recalls , the main incentive for *PRO* studying under <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Li Chung - sheng</COREF> was that <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Li 's</COREF> fees were relatively affordable .
Other painters charged upwards of 45 yuan per month , with fees at studios run * by older , more established Taiwanese artists reaching 60 or 70 yuan .
No amount of *PRO* scrimping and saving was going *-1 to put that within reach of someone like <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> , getting by on a military allowance of just 25 yuan per month .
The only choice was <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the Antung Street Studio</COREF> , where the monthly fee was just 20 yuan *T*-1 .

*PRO* Rescuing <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese art</COREF>
The economic constraints and repressive censorship of the era did nothing *PRO*-1 to deter <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">these young art fiends</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> recalls , the only art materials 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could get hold of *T*-1 were <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">red and black ink</COREF> , courtesy of the military , and pencils .
Sometimes <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> mixed <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the ink</COREF> with glue *PRO*-1 to produce an oil - paint texture .
*PRO* Scraping together the money for <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">just one tube of oil paint</COREF> involved considerable effort , and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> remembers *PRO*-1 repeatedly uncapping <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">that single tube</COREF> *PRO*-1 to breathe in the lovely scent of linseed oil .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">The painters</COREF> took turns *PRO*-1 taking off <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> shirts *PRO* to model for each other , and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> would sometimes spend the whole day *PRO* sketching customers at the ice - cream shop by the train station , after *PRO* paying for a single slice of watermelon .
In 1955 , *PRO*-1 against the advice of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> teacher and clueless about the risks involved * in *PRO* starting up a new organization -LRB- Taiwan was under martial law at the time -RRB- , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the young artists</COREF> formed <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> into the Ton - Fan Group .
People flocked *PRO*-1 to buy tickets for the exhibition that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> mounted *T*-2 at a venue in Taipei 's Chunghua Road , but <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">many visitors</COREF> found that the art was not to <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> liking .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Some</COREF> , feeling " cheated , " flung <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> exhibition leaflets</COREF> on the floor in disgust .
" <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> cost 50 cents each *PRO* to produce *?* ! " exclaims *T*-1 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> , still bemoaning the waste .
*PRO*-1 Raising the banner of reform , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the Outlaws</COREF> issued <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">a declaration</COREF> forecasting <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese art 's</COREF> inevitable decline if <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> stayed stuck in the past .
Only through the introduction of modern forms of expression from the outside world , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> said , could the boundless resources of <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">China 's art tradition</COREF> be revitalized *-1 .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT" E_OFF="2">The declaration , which <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> drafted *T*-1</COREF> , shows that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the group 's</COREF> objective was *PRO*-2 to modernize <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese art</COREF> by *PRO* drawing Western artistic concepts and methods into the production of essentially Chinese works .
This insistence on the " China " element has been a hallmark of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia Yang 's</COREF> art ever since .

Outlaws around the world
From paintings of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> done * during that early period , one sees how <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> rendered <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">human figures</COREF> *PRO*-1 using the thick lines of traditional Chinese folk painting *T*-2 , but proceeded *PRO*-1 to dissect and reassemble <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">those figures</COREF> in a Western , mechanistic fashion *T*-2 .
In <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-003-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> painting</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-003-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Flying Apsaras</COREF> , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> brings a modern geometrical approach to the traditional image of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">airborne Buddhist spirits</COREF> .
Critic Wang Chia - chi describes <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">these divine beings shown * wafting through a void of blank space</COREF> as " kind of surreal . . . like astronauts in a state of weightlessness . "
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> has also produced a number of purely abstract works , *PRO* drawing on <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> deep familiarity with <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-003-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">that most important element of Chinese art</COREF> - <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-003-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the use of line</COREF> .
In 1955 <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Hsiao Chin</COREF> went *PRO*-1 to study in Spain , *PRO*-1 becoming the first of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the Ton - Fan Group</COREF> 0 *T*-2 to go overseas .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> wrote back to <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *PRO* describing <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT" E_OFF="2">the new trends in art that <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was witness to *T*-1</COREF> , and <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the other painters</COREF> , after *PRO* poring over the contents of <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> densely written airmail letters , began putting some of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">those ideas</COREF> into practice .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was very cut off from the world in those days , and <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">those studying art naturally</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to see for <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> what *T*-2 was happening elsewhere .
In <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> letters to <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Hsiao</COREF> , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">all the others</COREF> , including <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-003-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> teacher</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-003-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Li Chung - sheng</COREF> , asked about the cost of *PRO* living overseas .
One by one , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">each member</COREF> of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the group</COREF> set off on <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own modern art pilgrimage to the West .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia Yang</COREF> , for whom <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF> was the art center of the world *T*-1 , made <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> move in 1963 , *PRO*-2 traveling by ship from Keelung to Hong Kong and from there on to Europe .
The cost of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> one - way ticket was borne *-1 by <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="134" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> colleague at Air Force HQ</COREF> <COREF ID="134" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang Chuan - jen</COREF> , who *T*-2 generously put <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> entire savings of NT$ 5,000 *U* at <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia 's</COREF> disposal</COREF> .
On the way to <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF> <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> stopped off in Milan *PRO*-1 to visit <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Hsiao Chin</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> remembers that <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Hsiao 's</COREF> first words on *PRO* meeting were : " *PRO* Come on , let 's paint . "
For someone like <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> , orphaned * early and shunted * for years among various relatives , the support and affection of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> friends has played a particularly important part in <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life .

<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Fuzzy people</COREF> , floating people
During <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> four - and - a - half years in Paris</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> lived in a tiny garret in the red light district with barely enough room 0 *PRO* to stand up in *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> supported <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *PRO*-1 doing miscellaneous jobs , working on people 's houses and restoring furniture .
Times were tough , but it was during <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this period</COREF> that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> found what <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had been probing for *T*-2 in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> use of line , and started on the " fuzzy people " phase of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> output *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia 's</COREF> fuzzy people</COREF> were born *-1 into <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> work as if by a natural process .
While *PRO* experimenting with a tangle of lines <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> found unidentifiable clusters taking shape , from which human forms began *-2 to emerge *T*-1 .
" This was something 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> really knew 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could work with *T*-2 , " recalls *T*-1 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> .
It was a case of " *PRO* seizing that special thing of your own , " which *T*-1 for an artist is of the utmost importance .
Like a Taoist priest painting magic symbols , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> uses line *PRO*-1 to create human figures and the written word *PRO*-3 to invoke power .
With rapid , sweeping strokes of the brush <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> creates <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">fluid , free - floating figures</COREF> , without faces or personalities , performing <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> allotted roles in the midst of a coldly linear realm .
The resulting images reflect the alienation of modern life , *PRO*-1 conveying a sense of illusion and impermanence .
It *EXP*-2 has been suggested *-1 that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="99" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsia Yang <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the lifelong drifter</COREF></COREF> , is the prototype for <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">these blurry beings</COREF> .
But then again , which of us *T*-1 is not in transit , *PRO*-1 drifting through this brief existence ?
" As the Chinese say *?* , man is a passenger through life who *T*-1 is gone in an instant .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia Yang 's</COREF> fuzzy people</COREF> exist very much within this Eastern philosophical context . "
So says *T*-1 <COREF ID="124" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Fu Shen</COREF> , <COREF ID="124" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the judges in the fine arts category for the 2000 National Culture and Arts Foundation awards</COREF> .

While <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in France <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> received a letter *ICH*-1 from a friend in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> saying : " Life is easier here . "
Soon afterwards <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> moved to <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> , *PRO*-1 renting <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">a cheap loft</COREF> in SoHo and supporting <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> as a furniture restorer .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Photorealism</COREF> was the vogue in American painting at the time .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> did n't appeal to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> at first , but <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knew 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had *-1 to learn something in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> new country of residence</COREF> , and at the same time <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needed *-2 to produce work that *T*-3 was commercially viable .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> began *-1 employing photographic effects , for example *PRO* depicting a crowd of passersby on a <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> street as a speeding blur .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> work now became populated with <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">" floating people " of this kind</COREF> , although in spirit <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were still the fuzzy people of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> earlier period .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> spent over 20 years in <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> , *PRO*-1 painting in the cavernous gloom of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> loft</COREF> , eating Chinese food and listening to traditional Chinese opera music .
The walls of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the loft</COREF> were pasted *-1 with simple verses , written * by <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> in language that *T*-2 was part literary Chinese and part colloquial .
" <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was like a Chinese person dwelling in a Chinese concession in <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> with a laugh .
The biggest boon of *PRO* living in <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> was that <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was where <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> met <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-005-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-005-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wu Shuang - hsi</COREF></COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> had grown up in a contented home *PRO*-1 never knowing poverty , and held a PhD in philosophy .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> met <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> through <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-005-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the painter</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-005-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsieh Li - fa</COREF> , and since then <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the two of them</COREF> have shared a simple and quiet life together .
" *PRO* Feeling * anxious when <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the old lady</COREF> 's not here *T*-1 , and looking listlessly out the window / *PRO* So bored of this dumb view , it 's much better when <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the silly little thing</COREF> 's around *T*-2 . "
So runs one of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia 's</COREF> light - hearted couplets , *PRO*-1 testifying to the affection that *T*-2 unites <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">these two people who *T*-3 only came together relatively late in life</COREF> .

With a basic source of income guaranteed * through an art - gallery contract , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> rented <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">a spacious , light - filled three - story house in Peitou</COREF> .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">The new place</COREF> was ideal for painting , but at NT$ 35,000 *U* per month <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the rent</COREF> was on the high side .

<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is something that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the reserved Hsia</COREF> has frequent cause *PRO*-2 to think about *T*-1 .
After *PRO* <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-006-E3" TYPE="IDENT">returning</COREF> to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia Yang</COREF> reverted to *PRO* painting <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">fuzzy people</COREF> .
Over the years , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia 's</COREF> fuzzy people</COREF> have taken on a number of different guises , 0 be it as judges , singers , couples , beach babes or whatever .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have mimicked famous icons of Western art such as the Mona Lisa , Millet 's The Gleaners , and Botticelli 's Venus , and now <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">the fuzzy family</COREF> includes <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-006-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">well - known figures from the Chinese Buddhist pantheon</COREF> , <COREF ID="ectb_1048.part-006-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">part of a series of works that *T*-1 examines the role of religion in people 's lives</COREF> .
For <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia Yang</COREF> , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">all characters</COREF> are fair game for inclusion in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> work , and <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">all of them</COREF> end up *-1 reverting to nothingness .

Fuzzy people stand up
Why is <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> so into <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">" fuzzy people</COREF> *T*-1 , " and has <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> ever thought about *PRO* trying something else ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The painter</COREF> points out that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> ca n't predict what direction <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may follow *T*-1 in the future , and says that if a new theme or style <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">emerges</COREF> <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be through a natural process , like the one that *T*-2 first gave birth to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the fuzzy people</COREF> .
At the end of 2000 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia 's</COREF> fuzzy people</COREF> at last " stood up " for <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> , *PRO*-1 becoming sculptures rather than just images on paper .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> was fiddling with <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">an aluminum ring from a broken hair - dryer</COREF> , *PRO*-1 shaping <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> into a little figure , when the idea *ICH*-2 dawned of *PRO* doing fuzzy people in solid form *T*-3 .
By *PRO* cutting and twisting pieces of copper , iron and steel , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was able *PRO*-1 to produce amusing little statuettes of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hitherto two - dimensional fuzzy people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia 's</COREF> friends were not surprised by <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> move into sculpture , because <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has always been good with <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hands</COREF> .
In New York <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> once made a hand - operated washing machine from a saucepan and several pieces of wood , and on another occasion <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> used the motor from an electric fan *PRO*-1 to power a self - adjusting easel .
In <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia 's</COREF> hands</COREF> , all sorts of discarded objects , from sewing machines to camera lenses , are salvaged *-1 and put *-1 to good use .
" <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm the Leonardo da Vinci of the Orient , " chuckles *T*-1 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> .
*PRO* Returning East has brought <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> back into contact with <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">the other " Outlaws " who *T*-1 used *-1 to dominate the Taiwan art scene</COREF> .
Of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> , Chen Tao - ming has since given up art and gone into business , Li Yuan - chia passed away in Britain , and Ouyang Wen - yuan does n't paint any more because of psychological problems .
However , Hsiao Chin , Wu Hao , Huo Kang and Hsiao Ming - hsien are all still active .
At a reunion two years ago , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> declared proudly : " <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're the same merry band of rebels , *PRO*-1 still advancing as one ! "
For <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">artists</COREF> to produce outstanding work <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-1 to immerse <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> utterly in the act of creation .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">These painters</COREF> , remaining committed to the " pure " creative spirit and thoroughly loyal to the cause of art , are still the same old " outlaws " that <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ever were *T*-1 .
