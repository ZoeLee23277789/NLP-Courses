On December 6 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the Executive Yuan</COREF> passed a draft amendment to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Public Officials Election and Recall Law</COREF> , tightening the criteria for those seeking public office so as *PRO* to prevent mob affiliates from *PRO* securing legal immunity as elected representatives .
Under <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the new provisions</COREF> , anyone convicted * and sentenced * to jail under the Organized Crime Statute is barred *-1 for life from *PRO* seeking election to an official post , while those indicted * for a capital offence or for crimes carrying sentences of ten years or more are barred *-2 pending the verdict of the court .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Political parties</COREF> become liable for the records of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> candidates and face fines of NT$ 500,000 to NT$ 5 million *U* if <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> nominate candidates who *T*-1 have prior convictions for electoral fraud or election violence .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">These revisions to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF></COREF> will immediately affect a number of parliamentary incumbents , including legislators Kuo Ting - tsai and Wu Tze - yuan , both of whom *T*-1 face disqualification from re-election .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">The new provisions</COREF> have received cross-party support in the legislature , though some deputies want further consultation concerning <COREF ID="ectb_1046.part-001-E5" TYPE="IDENT">the exclusion from elections of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">those charged * with *RNR*-1 but not yet convicted * of *RNR*-1 the relevant offences</COREF></COREF> , as <COREF ID="ectb_1046.part-001-E5" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> may deprive <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> unfairly of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rights .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ho Chih - hui</COREF> , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">secretary - general of the <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">KMT</COREF> caucus in the legislature</COREF> , says that <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the party</COREF> supports *PRO*-3 barring those convicted * of involvement in organized crime from public office , but feels that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the Executive Yuan</COREF> needs *-1 to clarify just what " involvement " constitutes *T*-2 in this context .
Also , at the end of December and after much consultation within the opposition alliance , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">a preliminary agreement</COREF> *ICH*-2 was reached *-1 on <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the draft amendment to the Farmers ' and Fishermen 's Associations Law , which *T*-3 has been under lengthy review in the legislature</COREF> .
According to <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the agreement</COREF> , restrictions on those seeking association membership and sub-committee posts will be relaxed *-1 , but the rules will be tightened *-2 for those running for the posts of director or general secretary , *PRO* excluding *RNR*-3 or removing *RNR*-3 from office anyone who *T*-4 is in default for more than a year on loans from these and other such financial organizations .
However , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the amendment</COREF> remains *-1 stuck *-1 in the legislative queue for the time being .

In addition to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the Ministry of Justice</COREF> , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Criminal Investigation Bureau</COREF> has also scored some successes *ICH*-1 in the past few months in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> campaign against crime syndicates .
In early November <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the leader of the Four Seas Gang</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Yang Kuang - nan</COREF> , who *T*-1 had been arrested *-1 in Shanghai by mainland authorities</COREF> , was transferred *-2 to Taiwanese custody in the transit lounge at Macau Airport and brought *-2 back to <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> for questioning .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Yang</COREF> had fled to the mainland in November 1997 , after a warrant was issued *-1 for <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> arrest in connection with a loan - shark operation , and has been a key target for the police ever since .
Good news has also been coming in from local prosecutors ' offices around <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
Prosecutors in Taitung have been investigating county councilors for alleged corruption involving public grants and construction projects , and after half a year of the investigation 19 representatives have been <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">indicted</COREF> *-1 , including the current speaker *RNR*-2 and deputy speaker *RNR*-2 of the county council , along with 41 members of the previous two sessions of the council .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> sets a judicial record for the number of elected representatives facing charges in a single case .
Meanwhile , prosecutors in Changhua have been investigating electoral fraud from the time of the presidential election , and are seeking sentences of two months to three years for over 200 people , including the head of Yuanlin Township , for *PRO* breaking the Election and Recall Law .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The Ministry of Justice</COREF> has achieved a measure of success so far in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> crackdown on black gold , but in order *PRO* to win public support <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has had *-1 to stress to investigators the need *PRO* to observe due process and respect suspects ' rights .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The ministry</COREF> has also required prosecutors *PRO*-3 to use discretion when *PRO* collecting evidence about suspected financial impropriety by officials - for which there is a low rate of conviction *T*-1 - *T*-2 so as *PRO* not to obstruct the work of <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">civil servants</COREF> or damage <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> morale .
