If you take <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">an interest</COREF> in the aboriginal tribes of central Taiwan , it wo n't be long before you run into the name of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 matters little what *T*-9 leads to <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">this interest</COREF> .
You might be filming a documentary or writing a magazine or newspaper article .
You might be engaged *-9 in a high - powered research project at Academia Sinica , or just writing a graduate thesis .
In any case , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> copious fieldwork is not something 0 you can afford *PRO*-1 to ignore *T*-9 .
Among other projects , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> work with <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Thao -LRB- also known * as the Shao or Sao -RRB-</COREF> , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a tiny aboriginal tribe living in the vicinity of Sun Moon Lake</COREF></COREF> , looms *PRO*-2 particularly important in the wake of <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the Chichi earthquake</COREF> , for <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the temblor</COREF> has dealt a heavy blow to a community that *T*-9 now has only 282 members left *-1 .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> has thrown <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> wholeheartedly into the task of *PRO* rebuilding the one village where <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the Thao</COREF> remain *T*-9 .
So who exactly is <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang</COREF> *T*-1 ?
How did <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> become such an important figure in the academic community *T*-9 ?
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang</COREF> had originally been planning *PRO*-9 to catch a flight on September 23 *PRO*-9 to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival together with <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife and children .
Little did <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> know , however , that <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> plans would be interrupted *-1 on September 21 by <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the biggest earthquake 0 *T*-2 to hit Taiwan in a century</COREF> .
A giant jolt in the wee hours sent <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> apartment building *PRO*-1 listing and caused the fourth floor to collapse entirely .
On the first floor , where <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> ran <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">a medical testing laboratory</COREF> *T*-9 , a quake - related power outage prevented <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> from *PRO* opening the front door .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> then hung a rope out a third - floor window and lowered <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> to safety , *PRO* <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">injuring</COREF> <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hands slightly in the process .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was n't too worried about <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the injuries</COREF> , nor was the destruction of <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> laboratory</COREF> a major concern .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was , however , extremely anxious *PRO*-9 to save <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">the results of ethnological fieldwork going back nearly two decades</COREF> .
For <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">these materials</COREF> were priceless treasures .
" Luckily , " says *?* <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , " <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> managed *PRO*-9 to get about 80 - 90 % of <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out . "

Explains *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , " <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> grew up *PRO*-9 listening to <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the old folks</COREF> tell stories about the aboriginal tribes .
There was talk about headhunting expeditions and wars .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> used *-9 to scare <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">us kids</COREF> by *PRO* saying ' The tribesmen will get <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ! ' "
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had frequent contact with aborigines , and many of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> best friends in school were aborigines .
After *PRO* graduating from the Department of Medical Laboratory Science at Chungtai Institute of Health Sciences and Technology , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took up an internship at the Puli Christian Hospital , where many of the patients were also aborigines *T*-1 .
In 1974 , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> opened <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">a medical testing laboratory</COREF> in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> .
Besides *PRO* providing <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> with a livelihood , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the lab</COREF> also brought <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> into contact with the aborigines , among whom <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would make many friends *T*-1 .

Self - trained ethnographer
*PRO*-9 Living in an ethnically complex area like <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> has always been very aware of ethnic conflict as well as the fusion and disappearance of cultures .
In 1967 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wei Huei - lin</COREF> , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an anthropology professor at Academia Sinica</COREF> ,</COREF> asked <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> *PRO*-9 to take <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO* to interview aborigines .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> picked up a lot of valuable fieldwork techniques by *PRO* watching <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Wei</COREF> interview the old folks .
Thereafter , whenever <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had any spare time *T*-1 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would go *PRO*-9 visit the aborigines and chat with the old folks .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> interest in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident of 1930 -LRB- in which members of several aboriginal tribes killed over 100 Japanese people in the village of Wushe and later met with grave retribution from the colonial authorities *T*-1 -RRB-</COREF> was piqued *-2 when <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father gave <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> two documents on <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the subject</COREF> *T*-9 .
" After <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> started *-9 taking an active interest in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident</COREF> in 1981 , people warned <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *PRO*-1 to be careful . "
Many scholars used *-9 to steer *PRO*-9 clear of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> colonial history</COREF> , but <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> happened *-1 to take an interest in <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the subject</COREF> just as Taiwanese society was beginning *-2 to become more liberal .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">The fact that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> was not a member of the academic community</COREF> was also fortunate , for <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> freed <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> of the pressures that academics must deal with *T*-9 .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , " This was about the story of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> hometown</COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> felt that this research simply had *-9 to be done *-9 . "
Although an amateur in the field of ethnography , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> is highly regarded *-9 in academic circles for <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> work in *PRO* recording the oral history of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> aborigines .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> good friend</COREF> <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Hao</COREF> , who *T*-9 teaches in junior high school , jokingly calls <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> *PRO*-1 " the Puli Center for Ethnographic Fieldwork . "
" When <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> first started *-1 doing <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> fieldwork *T*-9 there were still <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">about 20 survivors of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident</COREF></COREF> , but <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've all passed away now . "
According to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , most of <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">the ones lucky enough *PRO* to survive</COREF> were extremely reluctant *PRO*-9 to talk about <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and it *EXP*-1 took a long time for <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to win <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> trust , but <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did succeed eventually .
" <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had a couple of factors working in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> favor .
Number one , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was n't a government official , and number two , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> work in the field of medicine , so <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were n't quite so wary of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> . "
After *PRO* starting off with such subjects as religious beliefs and tribal customs , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the old folks</COREF> slowly got to the point where <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were willing *PRO*-1 to break <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> silence on more sensitive issues *T*-9 .

<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> does <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> homework
In the field of anthropology , there has been a growing trend *ICH*-2 in recent years *PRO* to rely on the results of field studies *PRO* to check the veracity of historical records .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang</COREF> enjoys close relations with the aborigines , which *T*-9 is why researchers and graduate students interested in *PRO* studying the Austronesian tribes of central Taiwan always come to Puli *PRO*-2 to seek <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> help *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> is a frequent participant in research projects focusing on the aboriginal tribes .
For example , in an Academia Sinica study that *T*-9 ran from 1992 to 1996 and focused on the cultural and kinship ties between Taiwan 's nine main aboriginal tribes , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> helped *PRO*-1 to study <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Thao</COREF> and <COREF ID="ectb_1011-part-003-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Pazeh</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1011-part-003-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a plains - dwelling tribe</COREF> -RRB- .
According to <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsu Mu - chu</COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a researcher at <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Academia Sinica 's Institute of Ethnology</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> " <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang 's</COREF> status as a member of the medical community and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wide contacts among the aborigines enabled <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 to make a key contribution to the research project . "
If it had n't been for <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> detailed knowledge of the kinship ties in some clans , the researchers would never have been able *ICH*-1 in some cases *PRO*-9 to identify pure tribal lineages for study .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , " The scholars at <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the Institute of Ethnology</COREF> have always given <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> a lot of support . "
*PRO*-9 Having received so much help , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> has practically felt an obligation *PRO* to make it count .
As a medical technician without formal training in ethnology , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> qualifications for *PRO* doing fieldwork have been questioned *-9 by some , but <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> work is highly regarded *-1 among the specialists at <COREF ID="121" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the Institute of Ethnology</COREF> and the Institute of Linguistics , Preparatory Office ,</COREF> <COREF ID="121" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB" E_OFF="2">two Academia Sinica bodies with which <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> has worked closely *T*-2</COREF> .
According to <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu Mu - chu</COREF> , " <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is very hard working , and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fieldwork methods come very close to what we ask *T*-9 of academic researchers . "
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> points out that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> study of <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Thao</COREF> is especially valuable because no one else has done any fieldwork on <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">this tribe</COREF> since 1958 .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> spent six years *PRO*-9 recording <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> religious festivals , marriage customs , property ownership system , land development , etc .
In so *PRO* doing *T*-1 , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has done much *PRO*-9 to make up for 40 years of neglect .
According to <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> , the theoretical framework used * by anthropologists must be supported *-9 by the results of fieldwork , and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> has done a very thorough job of *PRO* providing excellent first - hand materials .
Close observation over an extended period of time by local citizens can make up for the shortcomings of academic research .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> is in a better position than a professional researcher 0 *PRO* to engage in long - term observation of the month - long harvest festival of <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Thao</COREF> *T*-1 , for example , because <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> lives in the local area .
Thus it is that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has been able *PRO*-9 to <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">record</COREF> <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Thao tribe 's</COREF> religious festivals over a long period .
<COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> has been very helpful for researchers .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu Mu - chu</COREF> is now writing a book on the history of <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Thao</COREF> , and is relying heavily on <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> work .

Honorary Sediq
In <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu 's</COREF> opinion , it is <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> deep concern for <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fellow human beings</COREF> that *T*-9 has enabled <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 to devote so much of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> for such a long time to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fieldwork .
" It is n't every anthropologist , " says *?* <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> , " who *T*-9 shows <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this quality</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">This concern for <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fellow human beings</COREF> has earned <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> many friends among the aborigines .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">One such friend</COREF> is a man named * *PRO* <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Takken -LRB- Chinese name : Teng Chien - tang -RRB-</COREF> , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the great - grandson of a tribal chieftain</COREF> .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> grandfather and grandmother</COREF> were survivors of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident</COREF> , but <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had always been unwilling *PRO*-9 to talk about the past .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Takken</COREF> , " <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had never even heard of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident</COREF> when <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was a kid *T*-9 .
It was only after <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> entered the university that people gradually started *-9 talking about <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> points out that it *EXP*-1 is very unusual for someone , purely out of personal interest and concern , to visit <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">old folks</COREF> in so many tribes and do a systematic study of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> history .
" Our ancestors owe <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a great debt . "
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the teacher</COREF> <COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tajis Bawan</COREF></COREF> , " Before <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> met <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang</COREF> , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't have a very clear image of who <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were *T*-9 as a people , and <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had only heard unsubstantiated rumors and snippets about <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident</COREF> .

Later , however , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was invited *-9 *PRO*-9 to accompany <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> on <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> trips 0 *PRO* to interview old folks in the mountains *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">These forays</COREF> were very moving experiences for <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Bawan</COREF> .
" Here <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this man</COREF> is not even a member of <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">our tribe</COREF> , yet <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has been spending so much time and effort on <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> behalf .
How can <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> be content *PRO*-1 to know nothing about <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">ourselves</COREF> *T*-9 ? "
With <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> encouragement , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Bawan</COREF> started *-9 interviewing old folks on <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own and recording <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> tribe 's</COREF> eating habits , manner of dress , housing , geographic distribution , arts , folk legends , daily life , and other traditions .
At the same time , there are some <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Atayal</COREF> people who *T*-9 view <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> with suspicion , *PRO*-9 saying , " <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's just another plains dweller trying *PRO* to make money . "
Others have said , " <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's out *PRO*-1 to become famous . "
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Bawan</COREF> , too , had once harbored such suspicions , but since *PRO* getting involved in <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">fieldwork</COREF> <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has discovered how quickly the expenses *ICH*-1 add up for transportation , development of slides , and so much more *T*-2 .
Not only is <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> not a money - making proposition , <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's actually a drain on one 's personal finances .
As for fame , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Bawan</COREF> asks , " So what if <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">become</COREF> famous ?
<COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> did n't happen overnight .

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang</COREF> has written a number of articles based on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> years of fieldwork , including : " *PRO* Tracing the Origins of Written Language Among the Plains - Dwelling Aborigines of Puli , " " Why the Languages of the Plains - Dwelling Aborigines of the Puli Basin Have Disappeared *T*-1 , " " The Effect Upon the Thao Tribe of Han Chinese Settlement of the Shuishalien Area . "
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has also written several books , including : " <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The Wushe Incident</COREF> , " " <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Thick Fog , Dark Clouds</COREF> , " and " The Face of the Thao . "
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The Wushe Incident , which *T*-9 was selected *-9 as one of the ten best books of the year ,</COREF> provides a comprehensive history of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident</COREF> and includes many valuable historical photos .
With a keen sense of pathos , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> writes , " Misunderstandings and hatred born * of cultural differences and ethnic divisions were the main culprits behind <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident</COREF> . "
In 1993 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> won <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the 16th China Times Prize for Nonfiction</COREF> for <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Thick Fog , Dark Clouds - Aftermath of the Wushe Incident for an Atayal family</COREF> .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Thick Fog , Dark Clouds</COREF> focuses on the life of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Yawai Taimo</COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">daughter of an Atayal chieftain</COREF></COREF> .
In connection with the plan *ICH*-1 of the Japanese colonial authorities *PRO* to pacify the " barbarians , " <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">Yawai</COREF> was married off *-2 in 1912 to <COREF ID="95" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sazuka Narusuke</COREF> , <COREF ID="95" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the top - ranking police official in Wushe</COREF> .
Unfortunately for <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">Yawai</COREF> , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident of 1930</COREF> put people from mixed marriages like <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">hers</COREF> in a complex predicament .
Amidst the burning ethnic tensions of the time , *PRO* developing a sense of personal identity was especially difficult for <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the children , who *T*-9 hardly knew whether *PRO* to consider <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> Japanese , Taiwanese , Atayal , or Chinese</COREF> .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Thick Fog , Dark Clouds</COREF> is <COREF ID="ectb_1011.part-005-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the story of innocent , helpless victims of Taiwan 's turbulent history</COREF> .
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Li Jen - kuei</COREF> , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of Academia Sinica 's Institute of Linguistics , Preparatory Office</COREF> , wrote as *PRO* follows in <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the book 's</COREF> preface :
" Much has been written *-1 about <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the Wushe Incident</COREF> , but <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang</COREF> is the only one 0 *T*-2 to do it with such depth and feeling . "
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , however , feels rather uncomfortable about *PRO* winning a prize for nonfiction with <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> very first book</COREF> .
" It 's not that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> writing was all that good .
<COREF ID="ectb_1011.part-005-E1" TYPE="IDENT">The story <COREF ID="ectb_1011.part-005-E1" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> is just very compelling . "
After more than ten years of field research , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> wrote <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the book -LRB- over 100 pages long -RRB-</COREF> in just five evenings and then let <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> friends read the manuscript .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="173" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">One of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> friends</COREF> , <COREF ID="173" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the highly successful nonfiction writer Liao Chia - chan</COREF></COREF> , had only gotten five minutes into <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> before *PRO* exclaiming , " <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is going *-1 to win literary prizes ! "
Little did <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> know that <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> words would prove *-1 prophetic .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">Liao</COREF> , " A professional writer could never go that long without *PRO* writing anything , but <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang</COREF> does n't <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">make</COREF> <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> living as a writer , and <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> enabled <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 to let <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> gradually take shape over a long period of time . "
Right after *PRO* winning <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the literary prize</COREF> , however , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> was hit *-1 with <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">a lawsuit</COREF> by the grandson of <COREF ID="208" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Shimoyama Hiroshi and Sazuka Toyoko</COREF> , <COREF ID="208" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">two of the people that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> wrote about *T*-2 in <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">The suit</COREF> charges <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> with seven counts of libel .

The lawsuit was just part of a string of misfortunes for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> .
A nephew taking part in fieldwork fell into Sun Moon Lake and drowned .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> older sister , who *T*-9 had cared for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> when <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was growing up *T*-1 , died from cancer .
*PRO*-9 Deeply dispirited , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> put <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fieldwork aside and <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">moved</COREF> to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">New Zealand</COREF> with <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> family in 1995 .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">The move</COREF> was greeted *-9 with criticism :
" All that talk about <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> love for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> was just a put - on . "
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , however , responded , " We are moving to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">New Zealand</COREF> mainly for our children 's education .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF></COREF> am not leaving <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> .
In fact , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll be bringing the best of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">New Zealand</COREF> back here with <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> . "
In <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> view , there is much that we could learn *T*-9 from <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">New Zealand</COREF> , including <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> emphasis on lifelong learning , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sorted waste collection .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> good friend</COREF> <COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wang Hao</COREF></COREF> jokingly calls <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">" Puli 's</COREF> ambassador to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">New Zealand</COREF> . "
On one visit back home , people who *T*-9 had once collaborated in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fieldwork asked <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 to help *PRO*-2 formulate a community development project for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> , and a group that *T*-3 had taken part in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> study of the Thao tribe asked <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-4 to get back into fieldwork .
And so it was that the gravity of hometown , friends , and the land pulled <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> back to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> again .
*PRO*-1 Leaving <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife and children in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">New Zealand</COREF> , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> returned to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> *PRO*-1 to resume <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> unfinished work .
" <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> tried *PRO*-9 to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">write</COREF> in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">New Zealand</COREF> , but <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know whether it was the easy life or the distance .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just could n't do <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> . "
Since *PRO* returning , however , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still has n't been able *PRO*-9 to concentrate on <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> writing .
" <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm too involved in local affairs .
There are more errands and busywork than <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have time for *?* . "
According to <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Hao</COREF> , personal relationships in a small town like <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> are very close , and anyone with an outspoken personality ends up *-9 getting forced *-9 into all sorts of civic responsibilities .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> happens *-9 to be one of the more outspoken types in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> is the first person that many people meet *T*-2 when *PRO*-9 visiting <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> *T*-1 .
Not long after <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Li Chia - tung</COREF> became president of <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">National Chi - Nan University</COREF> <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made it a point *PRO*-9 to visit <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng Hsiang - yang</COREF> and Liao Chia - chan *PRO* to discuss ways 0 *PRO* to strengthen relations between <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">the university</COREF> and the local community *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> is thus very well known in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> , and extremely active in community affairs .
The list of projects in which <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has been involved *-9 *T*-2 is long :
a comprehensive community development project ; an effort *PRO* to preserve the Tamalin archeological site ; the writing of the section on aboriginal culture in a textbook on native culture in Nantou ; the Puli Music and Arts Festival ; an effort *PRO* to persuade Academia Sinica *PRO*-1 to establish a campus in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> ; etc .

<TEXT PARTNO="007">
*PRO* Passing the torch
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> had originally set <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> a goal of *PRO* getting <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> tenth book</COREF> written * and published * last year .
With a lot of material on hand , and with a lot of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> already written *-9 , all 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> needed *-2 to do *T*-1 was *PRO* add the finishing touches .
Part of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> focuses on the story of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Inoue Hajime</COREF> , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Japanese doctor whose life <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> has been studying *T*-9 for the past ten years</COREF></COREF> .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , " After <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Inoue 's</COREF> father</COREF> met <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> death</COREF> in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> at the hands of aborigines on a head hunting expedition , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Inoue</COREF> swore *PRO*-9 to ' avenge ' <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father 's</COREF> death</COREF> with kindness .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> ended up *-9 living 38 years among the aborigines , *PRO*-9 not even returning to <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> when <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother passed away *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> finally left <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> in 1947 .
When <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> went to <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> last January and paid <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> respects at <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> grave *T*-9 , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> discovered that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> gravestone was inscribed *-1 in Atayal .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> used *-9 to cry every time 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> talked about <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">this wonderful doctor</COREF> *T*-1 , but <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm getting a little less emotional about it as time goes by .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have *-9 to hurry up and get <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> written *-1 . "
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> had been planning *PRO*-9 to pass the torch to others , both in community affairs and in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> efforts *PRO* to collect the oral histories of the aborigines .
" <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've done <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> bit , " said *?* <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , " and soon it will be time 0 *PRO* to let <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the aborigines</COREF> speak for <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> *T*-9 . "
Then the earthquake threw a wrench in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> plans .
After <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> medical laboratory was destroyed *-9 , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> characteristically reacted by *PRO* throwing <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> energies into the task of *PRO* rebuilding <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the local community</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has kept <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *PRO*-9 busy *PRO*-9 preparing posters , organizing a community newspaper , and establishing the " New Puli Community Development Foundation . "
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng</COREF> , " <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> wo n't let <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> go ! "
The effort *PRO* to rebuild <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the community</COREF> takes precedence over everything else , so it looks like <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> writing plans will have *-9 to be postponed *-9 .
One thing , however , remains certain -
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Teng 's</COREF> love for <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Puli</COREF> and the aborigines will never fade .
