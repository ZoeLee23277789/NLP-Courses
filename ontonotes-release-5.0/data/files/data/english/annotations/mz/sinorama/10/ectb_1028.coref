Money for Nothin' ...
But It 's Not Risk Free
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. * by Phil Newell -RRB-
It *EXP*-2 is said *-1 that the two hottest subjects in post-martial law Taiwan have been sex and personal money management , which *T*-3 certainly goes *PRO*-3 to show the degree of openness and pluralism in today 's society .
Moreover , like sex , personal money management is something that <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">many people</COREF> only vaguely understand *T*-4 , that <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> feel uncertain about *PRO* committing <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> to *T*-1 , and that *T*-2 leaves <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-3 feeling tired and empty .
Personal money management is now a national sport .
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">The wealthy</COREF> hope *PRO*-9 to roll <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> money over , while <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">those less well off</COREF> are trying *PRO*-1 to make a small pile of <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own .
But what kind of money management approach *T*-9 is best suited to the current era ?
How can one win in the investment game without *PRO* losing the game of life in the process *T*-9 ?
" *PRO* Earning money is the first priority , *PRO* spending money is a sin , long live personal money management ! "
Thus declares a poster on the wall of <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="209" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a certain " Miss Chen</COREF> , " <COREF ID="209" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a secretary in a trucking company in Pingtung</COREF></COREF> .
Every night before *PRO* going to sleep <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> turns on <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> computer *PRO*-1 to check out the closing share prices for the Taiwan Stock Exchange and the opening figures for the US exchanges , and then makes a quick calculation *ICH*-2 in <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> head of <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> total wealth .
<COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">This woman , who *T*-9 is nearing 30 and has been working for seven years</COREF> , has a " personal value " which *T*-1 is still less than NT$ 600,000 *U* , so in order *PRO* to build up a fund for investing , <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> will not buy a house or go abroad for travel , and <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's becoming a Scrooge in the eyes of <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> friends .
Yet , all <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> discipline and <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> enthusiasm can not guarantee that <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> makes money .
And sometimes when <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> looks at the poster on <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> wall *T*-9 , <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> feels as if <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is being mocked *-1 .

If <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> knew then what <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know *T*-9 now ...
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Liu Li - chih</COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a 25 - year - old teacher</COREF></COREF> , is another e-generation personal money management enthusiast .
Even before <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> compulsory military service , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> began *-9 making investments of NT$ 3,000 *U* per month in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">a Japan technology fund</COREF> .
Over three years , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the fund</COREF> has gone from *PRO* taking losses to *PRO* taking off ; though <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has levelled off somewhat lately , the returns have been excellent .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Liu</COREF> declares <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> to be " a faithful believer " in all manner of personal money management books , and when <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has free time in summer vacation *T*-9 , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> spends an average of 20 hours a week *PRO*-1 looking at investment information .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> greatest regret is that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> began <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> financial career too late .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says : " If <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had used <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> allowance every year from the time 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was small *T*-9 *PRO*-1 to invest in a fund , at the rate of NT$ 30,000 *U* per year , after 20 years , there would be quite a lot of money right now . "
*PRO*-9 Becoming increasingly agitated , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> adds that if <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had understood money management early on , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could have invested right after the big stock market collapse in 1990 , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be rich *ICH*-1 today instead of regretful .
It looks like <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">more and more of the e-generation</COREF> are getting into investing .
But do <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know what <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are doing *T*-9 ?
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Dennis Chien of the money management website called * *PRO* JP Investment Clinic</COREF> strikes a cautionary note : " <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the education system</COREF> has fulfilled <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> responsibility *PRO* to teach <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> how *PRO* to manage <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> money *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Chien</COREF> points out that school textbooks only teach moral lessons like " a penny saved * is a penny earned * , " which *T*-9 are not exactly what the real world demands *T*-1 these days .
In contrast , many American children understand a bit about money management from early on .
For example , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">a child in <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> early teens</COREF> might babysit for the neighbors or cut lawns , and then put the money in a mutual fund .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Some investment websites</COREF> have games for <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">children</COREF> *PRO* to teach <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> about various investment instruments and portfolios .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> treat <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">personal money management</COREF> as a serious life skill that all modern people should know *T*-9 .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Chien</COREF> says that the situation is just like sex education in the past .
They give <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> only the most cursory treatment in schools , but <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">most people</COREF> have a strong desire *PRO* to find out about <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , so as a result <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-1 to pick up what <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can *?* *T*-2 from the newspapers or cable TV .
The result of the lack of a proper investment outlook is that speculation is rampant .
According to statistics of the Ministry of Finance , 87.5 % of the trading volume on the Taiwan stock exchange comes from individual investors .
In 1999 turnover was 288 % -LRB- that is , total trading volume was 2.88 times the total value of the market -RRB- , which , *T*-1 though considerably down from nearly 600 % ten years before , remained four times higher than the New York stock exchange .
Despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of *PRO* chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven *-2 difficult 0 *PRO* to change *T*-1 .

A new climate for the e-generation
Fortunately , over the last three years foreign investors have brought some new ideas into <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> .
Although <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> still engage in " hit - and - run " high - volume trading for quick gains , at least <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">most foreign investors</COREF> ignore gossip and do n't touch the more speculative stocks .
Rather , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> put more emphasis on the fundamentals of a given company or industry .
Dennis Chien notes that foreign firms have also introduced <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">risk management ideas like " *PRO* having a well - rounded portfolio " -LRB- i.e. " *PRO* do n't put all your eggs in one basket " -RRB-</COREF> .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> have had a positive impact on the local stock market , and have given the investment activities of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the e-generation</COREF> a more rational foundation than those of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> parents .
The chief characteristics of the current wave of e-generation personal money management are great ambition , reliance on expert analysis , and diversification of investment targets .
Nevertheless , the hottest investments are always <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">changing</COREF> , and perhaps no amount of rational analysis or detailed information will be able *PRO*-9 to change <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chia Chen - i</COREF> , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">senior executive vice president of the Individual Banking Sector at Bank Sinopac -LRB- which *T*-1 earlier this year created a stir in the industry by *PRO* introducing the world 's first five - in - one money management account -RRB-</COREF></COREF> has been observing the evolution of the financial environment in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> for many years , and offers the following thoughts about trends in money management .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Chia</COREF> recalls that in the 1960s , people were too poor 0 *T*-1 to have any money 0 *PRO* to manage *T*-2 ; there were also fears of war , and so any money 0 <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> did have *T*-3 <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> quickly exchanged *T*-4 for gold or US dollars on the black market .
In the 1970s , *PRO* faced with two oil crises and inflation , the idea of *PRO* buying property *PRO* to preserve value became widespread , and those who *T*-1 could afford <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> bought <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">land and houses</COREF> .
At that time , <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> had only a hundred or so listed companies , and <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> fate depended on a few manipulators behind the scenes .
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was seen *-9 as a " cannibalistic market " which *T*-1 scared off most citizens .

The past is gone
The real fad for personal money management only hit <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> in the mid-1980s .
It was then that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> accumulated economic resources began *-1 to come to the surface *T*-9 .
The huge trade surplus built * up over many years caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
The stock market index rose from 600 or so in 1985 to more than 12,000 by 1990 .
Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of NT$ 71,800 per ping -LRB- about 3.3 square meters -RRB- in 1986 to NT$ 284,500 *U* per ping in <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">1989</COREF> .
At <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">that time</COREF> , great opportunities for *PRO* making money stared one right in the face .
In pursuit of overnight wealth , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">many people</COREF> mortgaged <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> property *PRO*-1 to buy <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">stocks</COREF> , and then used <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> stocks</COREF> as collateral *PRO*-1 to borrow more money , *PRO* creating a vicious cycle that *T*-3 laid the foundation for the burst bubble and huge debts of later years .
But , *PRO*-1 having reviewed the past , Chia Chen - i declares : " In money management , you can only look to the future ; there 's no point in *PRO* regretting what *T*-9 's gone . "
Indeed , in the era of the Internet , with everything moving much faster , investment indicators like product popularity and employment trends can change overnight .
Those who *T*-1 can not see the trends or who *T*-2 can not react fast enough are doomed *-9 to be the losers in the wealth game .
*PRO* Take for example the case of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Chang</COREF> .
*PRO*-9 Widowed *-9 at an early age , for over 20 years <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> supported <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> family as an independent real estate broker .
<COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> success made <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> very confident about <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> understanding of <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the property market</COREF> .
Six years ago , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> decided *PRO*-9 to help <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the family of <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> younger brother</COREF> , who *T*-1 contracted a terminal illness</COREF> , *PRO*-2 to buy a new house .
At the time , the price of high - rise apartments in <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the Tanshui New Town</COREF> had fallen from NT$ 220,000 *U* per ping to NT$ 150,000 *U* .
*PRO*-1 Congratulating <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> on *PRO* getting a low price , and confident that <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> would rebound , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Chang</COREF> happily put down the first payment and watched <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> brother 's</COREF> family</COREF> move in .
However , it was about this time that many new projects - started * earlier by construction firms hoping *PRO*-1 to take advantage of peak prices - came on <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> *T*-9 .
The number of empty units rose to over one million .
Next , increased cross-strait tensions put a further damper on <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the property market</COREF> .
The September 21 earthquake last year was the final straw .
Today you can find high - rise apartments in <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui New Town</COREF> for as little as NT$ 110,000 *U* per ping .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Chang 's</COREF> brother 's</COREF> family</COREF> is stuck *-9 with a heavy mortgage , and there are constant recriminations between <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Chang</COREF> and <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> nieces and nephews.

Will the Taiwan property market inevitably recover ?
Not necessarily .
*PRO* Looking around the world , at <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> , Japan , Hong Kong , and even mainland China , there are countless examples of long - term downturns in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the housing market</COREF> .
The popular book *PRO* Die Broke notes that the sharp rise in housing prices in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> in the 1960s and 1970s was due to underlying structural factors :
The large generation of " baby boomers " were starting careers and families , *PRO* thereby increasing demand for housing .
At that time , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">some of the older generation about *-1 to retire happily</COREF> sold <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> houses to the younger at high prices .
The large profits 0 <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> earned *T*-9 attracted numerous speculators into <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> , and prices were driven *-1 *PRO*-1 even higher , *PRO* encouraging construction of ever more homes .
But now that <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">most of the baby boomers</COREF> have <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own homes , and the current " e-generation " is smaller , who are all those extra homes going *-1 to be sold *-1 to *T*-9 ?
Snafu
The upshot of all this is , as <COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsu Yen - shan</COREF> , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chairman of the Department of Finance at National Chengchi University</COREF> , cautions : " There are no absolute experts at money management . "
So - called experts are simply those who *T*-9 have particular knowledge about a certain sector in a certain place at a certain time .
But you know the old saying : " People have two feet , but money has four . "
Trends change faster than most people can anticipate .
No wonder 0 the " stock masters " featured * on cable TV usually disappear from view after a brief reign , *PRO*-1 only to be replaced *-1 by equally short - lived successors .

In the past two years , *PRO*-2 perhaps brainwashed * by money management dogma that *T*-9 says " the early bird gets the worm , " investors have swarmed like bees for the latest fads , *PRO*-2 sometimes jumping in even before the true value is known *-1 .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">The US NASDAQ index , which *T*-9 has a history of 29 years behind <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> , suddenly surged from 2800 in October of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> to more than 5000 by March of <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> .
Telecommunications , Internet , and biotechnology stocks soared .
The price - to - earnings ratio of some individual stocks reached 500 , which some ridiculed *T*-9 as the " price - to - dream ratio . "
" <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Investors</COREF> sometimes act as if <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't care about a company 's current losses , but simply put all <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> faith in the distant future .
Unfortunately , the farther in the future 0 something is *T*-1 , the more likely it *EXP*-2 is *T*-3 that expectations will be wrong , " points *T*-4 out <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="55" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chiu Shean - bii</COREF> , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a professor of finance at National Taiwan University</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* Beginning in mid-March of <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> , NASDAQ high - tech stocks plummeted .
For many investors , earnings accumulated * over many years disappeared in a matter of weeks .
The misguided idea that " what *T*-9 is new is better " also has been a problem in Taiwan .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">A certain " Mr. Wang , " who *T*-9 works in the government</COREF> , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would jump on the bandwagon for telecom and Internet stocks .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> borrowed money *PRO* to purchase 80 blocks of shares *ICH*-1 , at NT$ 13 *U* per share , of fixed - line Internet network stocks , which *T*-9 had n't yet even been listed *-9 .
When the price fell to NT$ 11 *U* per share *T*-9 , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still did n't worry , *PRO*-1 thinking that " so long as <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't sell , the loss wo n't be realized *-2 . "
Little did <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> expect that the new government would clamp down on illegal trading in fixed - line network stocks *T*-1 .
Suddenly <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> whole investment - well over NT$ 1 million *U* - has been frozen *-9 , and all 0 <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can do *T*-1 is *PRO* stand on the sidelines in a state of panic .
*PRO* To be sure , ignorance of new trends is not recommended *-1 , but *PRO* looking too far into the future can also lead to disappointment .
Indeed , in this information era , money management may even be getting more difficult .
Strange *PRO* to say *?* , but the explosion of money management information , which *T*-9 should in theory make investors ' lives easier , does not *?* .
As <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Chiu Shean - bii</COREF> says : " There 's plenty of information out there , and there are so - called experts everywhere .
But the result is that investors do n't know what *PRO* to believe *T*-9 , and find it *EXP*-1 even more difficult *PRO* to make a decision . "
Moreover , often even the best information and analysis is no match for sheer luck .
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Cabula Chang</COREF> , <COREF ID="167" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">editor - in - chief of the money management website SmartNet</COREF> , describes a case in point .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Last year</COREF> , <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">one of the hottest stocks</COREF> was Quanta Computers , which *T*-9 reached 800 per share .
The story goes that there was <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">an old grandmother who *T*-9 followed the crowd in and out of <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">the stock</COREF> , *PRO*-9 earning a huge amount in the process</COREF> .
Afterwards , <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> asked : " What <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> still do n't understand *T*-9 is , how can *PRO* selling pork jerky be so profitable *T*-1 ? "
It *EXP*-1 turns out that <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was investing in a dried - pork company of the same name , and those who *T*-9 heard <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> question nearly fainted with disbelief .

<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Money management madness</COREF>
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The fever for money management</COREF> has in fact disrupted the lives of many people , and brought a lot of headaches .
However , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jessica Liu</COREF> , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">associate director of the Taipei branch of UBS</COREF> , who *T*-9 has written a number of books on money management</COREF> , says that there is no *PRO* turning back .
Whenever some people get ahead *T*-9 , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">others</COREF> will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
The reason is very simple .
" <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The money management fever</COREF> is a natural product of changing times . "
According to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Liu</COREF> , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .
In addition , since the 1980s Taiwan has been swept *-9 up in the globalization of capitalism .
Rural society has disintegrated , and traditional industrial sectors have withered , as newly rising electronics and information industries have appeared one after another .
These rapid changes have brought the threat of unemployment or early retirement to many individuals .
In order *PRO* to cope with the increasing uncertainty of life , it *EXP*-1 is necessary for people to build up a nest egg .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Liu</COREF> says : " If you have NT$ 30 million *U* in the bank , you do n't care whether you have *-9 to retire or not .
What *T*-9 's important is that you do n't have *-1 to worry about the future , and live in fear that a sudden loss of your salary could ruin your life . " Of course , everyone <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">feels</COREF> a different sense of urgency about the uncertainties of life .
Sometimes , in fact , <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> can become a source of interpersonal friction .
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">" Miss Chen " of Pingtung</COREF> worries that <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> father , 0 *T*-1 soon to retire at age 60</COREF> , does n't think much about money , and <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> expected retirement plus savings will be less than NT$ 4 million *U* -LRB- about US$ 120,000 *U* -RRB- .

It seems 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have n't realized yet that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may live *PRO*-9 to be 85 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that *T*-9 can be expected *-9 over the next 25 years . "

Meanwhile , the changes in the larger environment that *T*-9 are making <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> anxious about <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> economic security are boons to companies trying *PRO* to market financial products .
A certain American bank has recently been doing <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">" carpet bombing " advertising</COREF> with slogans like " One out of every two people wants *PRO*-9 to retire ten years early , but has n't yet begun a financial plan ! " or " <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">60 % of parents</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to send <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children abroad *PRO* to study , but <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">one - third of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF></COREF> do n't know how much money <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should prepare *T*-2 ! "
It *EXP*-1 is said *-2 that <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">these ads</COREF> have been very effective .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen Yi - fen</COREF> , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">vice president of the Individual Banking Department at Fubon Bank</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-2 speaking as someone who *T*-9 has been closely following this problem from the sidelines , reminds consumers that no matter what the source - advertising , websites , or whatever - though advice may be cloaked *-3 in a halo of expertise , the motive is *PRO* to sell products and to earn money from the financial activities of clients .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> says : " It 's like those ads for milk that *T*-9 emphasize how fearful <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">osteoporosis</COREF> is *T*-1 .
The problem is , 0 they do n't tell you that milk is by no means the only way 0 *PRO* to prevent <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> *T*-9 , or even the most effective . "

Another factor driving " investment anxiety " is peer pressure . "
If <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">a 40 - year - old</COREF> does not have a securities account , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wo n't be able *PRO*-1 to engage in conversations with <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> peers about the market , so naturally <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will feel out of touch , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Cabula Chang</COREF> .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> admits that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still lives in a rented house in Tanshui .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> wife</COREF> wonders why <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> colleagues in the financial management community are multi-millionaires , while <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still has not had <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> rendezvous with fortune *T*-9 .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> tells <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife</COREF> that one should not compare oneself to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">others</COREF> .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> success may be temporary or even illusory .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">A number of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> friends who *T*-9 had insider information</COREF> were quite proud of <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> when <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> profited from the rise of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan Pineapple</COREF> to more than 200 *T*-1 .
But within less than two years , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the stock</COREF> collapsed and became worthless paper .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> recalls <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">an inexperienced reporter who *T*-9 got sucked *-9 in to the market two years ago by some irresistible insider information</COREF> .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> even mortgaged <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> house and persuaded <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> friends *PRO*-9 to invest with <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
Today , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still has not got <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> head above water .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> says , " The longer 0 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm in this business *T*-1 , the more <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> feel *T*-2 that you ca n't get anywhere by *PRO* trying *PRO* to get ahead quickly . "
Investment options are like churning whirlpools ; of course you enjoy the ride as long as you are on top of the water , but currents shift , and eventually you may get sucked *-9 down .
" In investing , until the final moment , you never know whether you 've won or lost . "
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Jessica Liu , who *T*-9 personally feels little anxiety about money management</COREF> , points out that one of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> core principles for investing is *PRO* to not compare <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> with others .
" This is because <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know that opportunities *PRO* to make money come and go .
If <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't make a lot this wave , there 'll be another wave later . "
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says that anxiety rises in direct proportion to a person 's expectations and desires .
The more 0 you want *T*-1 , the more anxiety you feel *T*-2 , and the greater will be *T*-3 the sense of disappointment if you fail .
In other words , anxiety derives from greed .
" If you buy <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">TSMC</COREF> at 150 *PRO*-1 hoping 0 <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will go up to 220 within a couple of months because that 's what you need *T*-9 *PRO*-3 to make your final house payment , then <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> only goes up to 200 , you 'll feel dissatisfied , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Liu</COREF> .
This sense of disappointment is completely due to the lack of a proper money management outlook .
People in middle age invest in hopes of *PRO* finding a sense of personal security .
But members of the e-generation often have more specific objectives in mind .
<COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Yu - ting , currently a sophomore in the Department of Financial Management at National Chengchi University</COREF> , puts the money 0 <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> makes *T*-9 *PRO*-1 working part - time into the market .
<COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says that <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> has " a specific plan for each period of time , such as *PRO* going abroad , or buying a car . "
So <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> aim is " *PRO* to manage <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> money</COREF> so that <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can spend <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ! "
<COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">Lin 's</COREF> classmate Ou Chien - ming</COREF> says that <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has always wanted *PRO*-9 to save money *PRO*-9 to go traveling with <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> girlfriend .
Last year , after *PRO* vacillating for quite a while , <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> finally borrowed NT$ 80,000 *U* from <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother *PRO*-1 to invest in stocks , under the assumption that , by *PRO* putting to use what <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was learning *T*-3 in school , it *EXP*-2 would n't be that hard *PRO* to make a good return .
Alas , <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> put <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> faith in the predictions of a certain investment adviser , and put everything 0 <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had *T*-9 into securities stocks , which *T*-1 stagnated .
After the election of Chen Shui - bian as president , <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> mistakenly assumed that the market would go down , and sold everything without *PRO* even looking at the share prices .
<COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> ended up *-1 selling at the low point , and <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> dream of *PRO* going abroad</COREF> is even farther out of reach than <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was *?* before .

Healthy money management
Chiu Shean - bii of National Taiwan University was told *-9 in a recent meeting with <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the general manager of certain large American commercial bank</COREF> : " Asians always ask : ' Is the market going *-1 to go up or down tomorrow ? '
But <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">investment advisors</COREF> are not weather forecasters , and <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't pretend that <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can know the future . "
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">This banker</COREF> says that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> money management target is *PRO*-1 not to make a specific profit within a specific time , but to use a variety of financial instruments - including defensive investments like insurance and reliable ones like savings , as well as an active investment portfolio - *PRO* to appropriately diversify <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> assets .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> seeks *PRO*-9 to " build a Noah 's ark .
When the weather is good *T*-9 , you can make a little more progress , but when <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">storms</COREF> hit *T*-1 , you can ride <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> out . "
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Yi - fen , who *T*-9 comes across all manner of money management plans every day</COREF> , often wonders about the meaning of it all .
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says that today <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">banks</COREF> are always talking about how <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to provide every individual with tools 0 *PRO* to " intelligently manage money *T*-2 *T*-9 . "
For example , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> provide credit cards that *T*-9 award bonus points , housing loans with built - in short - term overdrafts for investment , and even mutual fund accounts that *T*-1 will automatically invest a specific amount at fixed times .
But how much money *T*-9 is enough ?
That depends on the values of the individual .
" <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Each individual</COREF> should choose a lifestyle and belief system that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> feel comfortable with *T*-9 , and not just follow the crowd , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> .
After all , in a pluralized society , there should be more than one definition of success .
Recently there was a news story about <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="111" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the old author</COREF> <COREF ID="111" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang Tuo - wu</COREF></COREF> having *-9 to sell lottery tickets on the street .
One financial expert took <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> as an object lesson 0 *T*-3 to " warn " <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> *PRO*-1 to learn how *PRO* to manage <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> money *T*-2 .
Yet , *PRO* looking at this another way , if <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> had spent <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> youth *PRO*-2 worrying about *PRO* accumulating money , <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would not have had the experiences 0 <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did *?* *T*-3 and made <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> way from *PRO* being an ordinary soldier to *PRO* writing such moving works .
In the end , there are no numbers that *T*-9 can validly measure what *T*-1 has been gained *-1 in life , and what *T*-2 lost *-2 .
It *EXP*-2 is said *-1 that the two biggest causes of family arguments this year have been differences over who *PRO* to vote for *T*-9 in the presidential election , and over what stocks *PRO* to buy *T*-3 .
As Jessica Liu reminds us , money management , like <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">life <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> , is an accumulation of small experiences , a long road with ups and downs , and so should be faced *-9 with equanimity .
After all , is n't the point of *PRO* making money *PRO* to have a better life ?
But if you lose your sense of fun , your health , or your friends and family in the process , and if you win the money game only at the cost of *PRO* losing the game of life , what kind of a return on your investment is that *T*-1 ?
