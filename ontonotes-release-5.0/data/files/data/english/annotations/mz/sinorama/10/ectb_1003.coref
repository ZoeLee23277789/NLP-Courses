A Second Spring for Textiles in <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> ?

Early in December <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">the China Textile In - stitute , located * at Tucheng in Taipei County</COREF> , celebrated <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> 40th anniversary with a dynamic multimedia show .
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">The CTI 's</COREF> 40 - year history has borne witness to the rise and decline of <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> textile industry</COREF> .
Forty years ago , <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was just crossing the threshold of industrialization .
<COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">The textile industry</COREF> was the darling of <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> , just like the electronics industry today .
Although <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has lost <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> former kudos , <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">the textile industry</COREF> is still an indispensable part of <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> industrial landscape .
For the last decade , <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI</COREF> has been working hand in hand with <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> , *PRO*-1 quietly sowing <COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT">the seeds of research and development</COREF> in many places .
Can <COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT">those seeds</COREF> germinate *PRO*-9 to create a second spring for <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> textile industry</COREF> ?
As the latest bout of winter weather hits <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , do you want *PRO*-9 to go up Mt. Hehuan *PRO*-9 to see the snow ?
You could put on a jacket containing highly insulating melt - spun ceramic fibers .
When the wind sends a fine driving rain slanting across the water *T*-2 , are you still unwilling *PRO*-1 to forgo the pleasure of sea angling ?
Why *PRO* not wear some micropore breathable rainwear , with an outer layer which *T*-1 is completely waterproof , but an inner layer which *T*-2 is dry and comfortable on the skin *T*-3 ?
Tencel , made * from wood cellulose , has given the lie to the notion that man - made fibers never degrade , and is set *-8 to become one of the most important fibers of the coming environmental century ; and the shrimp and crab shells which *T*-2 were once tossed *-2 away are now being processed *-1 *PRO* to extract chitin , which *T*-3 when *PRO* used * *PRO* to treat clothing *T*-4 can inhibit bacteria and mold and prevent unwanted odors , and which *T*-6 can also be used *-6 as a dressing for burns which *T*-7 both reduces inflammation and encourages new tissue growth . . . .

What sunset industry ?
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Ceramic fibers , stainless steel , shrimp shells</COREF> - at first glance there seems *-1 to be no connection with spinning and weaving .
But in fact <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are among the latest products and trends quietly taking shape in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the textile industry</COREF> .
With the rise of new industries such as electronics , aerospace and biotechnology , the areas of application for <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">textile products</COREF> have expanded ever wider , from *PRO* being simply coverings for the human body to *PRO* finding <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way up into space and down into the earth .
" There are only sunset products , not sunset industries . "
These words from competitiveness guru Michael Porter hit the nail on the head when it comes to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> textile industry 's</COREF> current efforts *PRO* to transform <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> into a high - tech , capital - and information - intensive sector *T*-9 .
" Twenty years ago , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the polyester uniforms worn * by schoolchildren in <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> turned *-4 dreadfully stiff when you tried *PRO*-1 to wash <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-9 ; cotton clothes shrank ; nylon made your skin red and itchy ; <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">stockings</COREF> would ladder if you so much as looked at <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> ; and decent clothes had *-2 to be expensively dry cleaned *-2 , " recalls *T*-3 <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">CTI president Yao Hsing - chuan</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">clothes in <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF></COREF> are getting ever lighter , softer , warmer , more wrinkle - free and easier *PRO* to keep * clean , and if <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> colors are bright , fresh and stain - resistant , this is not thanks to the magic wand wielded * by Cinderella 's fairy godmother , but is the result of the unceasing efforts towards research , development and upgrading put * in by <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the textile industry</COREF> over the years .
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">" Upgrading "</COREF> has been a word on the lips of everyone in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the textile industry</COREF> in recent years .
But the adverse environment in which <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> has had *-9 to operate *T*-1 has made the pace of <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">that upgrading</COREF> halting and hesitant .
" In the early 1980s , *PRO* making ready - *PRO* to - wear garments for export was pretty much a sure - fire money - spinner .
Everything sold like hot cakes , just like electronics <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Yao Hsing - chuan</COREF> .
But around 1987 , under strong US pressure , the NT dollar appreciated , and <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">exporters</COREF> lost <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> competitive price advantage .
Next , there was a series of rises in land and labor costs .
Garment making is labor - intensive , and the combination of internal and external pressures led to wholesale factory closures .
Many firms moved production to <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> or <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Southeast Asia</COREF> , and <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> remaining domestic textile industry was dramatically reshuffled *-9 .
With the departure of the ready - *PRO* to - wear industry , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> lost <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> " garment kingdom " status .
But *PRO* looking from another perspective , <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwanese manufacturers who *T*-9 spread all over <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Southeast Asia</COREF> , <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> and Latin America</COREF> were still very much a force 0 *PRO*-1 to be reckoned with *-1 , and in <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> new locations <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> continued *-2 to source raw materials and semi-finished goods from <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
With <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> support , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the upstream portions of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF></COREF> - <COREF ID="174" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">fiber making , yarn spinning , weaving , dyeing , finishing and garment design</COREF> - were able *PRO*-1 to stay in <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and prosper .
In September 1998 , while <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> was still reeling from the effects of <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">the Asian financial crisis</COREF> , construction *ICH*-1 began of <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the long - planned specialist industrial parks in Yunlin and Changhua Counties</COREF> .
<COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> were the peak of the large investments made * in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> textile industry</COREF> over recent years .
But overcapacity and shrinking demand caused * by <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">the crisis</COREF> had hit <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> hard .
By mid-1999 things were looking up again , but then massive power failures in the wake of the 21 September earthquake wiped out nearly NT$ 10 billion *U* worth of textile orders .

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> biggest currency earner
Nevertheless , thanks to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> solid foundations built * up over 40 years , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the textile industry</COREF> is still a pillar of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> economy .
In 1999 , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> textile exports are expected *-9 to be worth US$ 14.5 billion *U* or 12 % of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the island 's</COREF> total exports , behind only electronics -LRB- 17.6 % -RRB- and IT / telecom products -LRB- 12.3 % -RRB- .
Moreover , after *PRO* deducting the cost of imported raw materials etc. , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the textile industry</COREF> is <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> biggest foreign currency earner , *PRO*-1 bringing in over US$ 10 billion each year .
For instance , polyester is the most widely used man - made fiber , and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">little Taiwan</COREF> produces no less than 17 % of the total worldwide supply , *PRO*-1 making <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> the largest supplier .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The island 's</COREF> total production of man - made fibers ranks third globally , behind the USA and <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> .
At present , the largest category among <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> textile exports</COREF> is finished cloth , which *T*-9 accounts for more than 60 % of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> textile exports</COREF> by value .
" <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">The textile industry</COREF> has deep roots in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and there are many processes 0 *T*-9 to be gone through *-9 from the fiber to the finished garment .
Thus there are many key technologies which *T*-9 can be developed *-9 , and <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> can sustain a large workforce . "
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">CTI</COREF> acting vice-president Wu Chung - fu observes that the advanced countries still devote substantial efforts to *PRO* <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">developing</COREF> textile technologies , and naturally <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is something 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> should not lightly give *T*-9 up .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> ca n't give <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up , but neither can <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> rest on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> laurels .
With Southeast Asia and <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> catching up fast , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> textile industry</COREF> will only have a future if <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can quickly transform <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> and develop towards high - tech products .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">The CTI , which *T*-1 a decade ago began a timely change in <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> role to one of a specialist R-AMP-D center working in partnership with firms</COREF> , has become the leading R-AMP-D center for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> several thousand textile industry companies .
The development of new " nylon 66 " fibers is a case in point .
<COREF ID="ectb_1003-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="135" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Grace Kuo</COREF> , <COREF ID="135" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a vice-president at <COREF ID="138" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ta Ching Hwa Enterprise Co</COREF></COREF> .</COREF>
-LRB- <COREF ID="138" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">TCH</COREF> -RRB- , as yet the only company in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> 0 *T*-9 to manufacture nylon 66 filament , recounts that ten years ago <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1003-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband and a group of friends who *T*-3 had worked many years at Formosa Chemicals and Fiber Corporation</COREF> wanted *PRO*-2 to set up in business for <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
At that time , a huge amount of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">nylon 66 fiber</COREF> - 600 tonnes per month - was used *-9 by the local textile industry in the manufacture of specialty apparel such as women 's tights , swimwear and underwear .
But <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> had no manufacturing capability in <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the fiber</COREF> , and relied entirely on imports .
This aroused <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> interest in *PRO* entering the field .

David and Goliath
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Grace Kuo</COREF> comments that nylon 66 was a new fiber with good elasticity , high strength and a soft , bulky feel , along with good resistance to ultraviolet light .
*PRO* Adding just 15 to 20 % of nylon 66 to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">a fabric</COREF> <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">transforms</COREF> <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , *PRO*-1 making <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> thoroughly suited to modern - day demands for " healthy , comfortable " clothing .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">The big international manufacturers</COREF> had realized <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and adopted an oligarchic strategy : *PRO* as well as making it *EXP*-2 difficult for others *PRO* to obtain the raw materials , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were very careful *PRO*-1 not to reveal any of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> manufacturing know - how .
But thanks to the expertise 0 the <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">TCH</COREF> team had built *T*-2 up over many years in the textile fibers field , within the first year after <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> was set *-9 up <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">succeeded</COREF> in *PRO* drawing filaments from nylon 66 granules .
" As soon as <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Dupont</COREF> cut <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> prices , *PRO*-9 hoping *PRO*-9 to squeeze <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> right out of the market , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Grace Kuo</COREF> with a smile .
But after *PRO* going head - to - head with <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">TCH</COREF> for several years , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Dupont</COREF> realized how resilient <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> was *T*-2 , and since then the two firms have begun *-1 to cooperate .
Currently , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">TCH</COREF> is <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the world 's</COREF> fifth - largest manufacturer of nylon 66 filament , *PRO*-1 supplying 8 % of the global market .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> stands as another example of a Taiwanese company successfully taking on the big boys in international markets .
The original use of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">nylon 66</COREF> was in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">tights and swimwear</COREF> , but <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are far from *PRO* being the only applications for such a superior new fiber .
But because <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the filaments</COREF> are so thin -LRB- only half the thickness of a human hair -RRB- , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can easily break at the yarn spinning stage , and at the dyeing stage the yarn absorbs only the smallest dye molecules .
Hence <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">firms around <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF></COREF> are still <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">feeling</COREF> <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way forward on how *PRO* to use <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">this fiber</COREF> *T*-9 .
For <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">this reason</COREF> , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">TCH</COREF> approached <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI</COREF> *PRO* to conduct a series of cooperative development projects .
To date <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have successfully developed various new yarns blended * from nylon 66 and other fibers such as acrylic or polyester , and have staged numerous seminars and visited many firms *PRO*-9 to teach users how *PRO* to weave and dye <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the new fabrics</COREF> *T*-1 and how *PRO* to design for <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-2 .
Why *PRO* go to such lengths *PRO* to popularize new fibers *T*-9 ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Grace Kuo</COREF> says 0 the textile industry <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> needs *-2 to take a lead from the electronics industry , and constantly strive for innovation : " What consumer *T*-1 <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> does n't already have a wardrobe full of clothes ?
If you want *PRO*-9 to persuade her *PRO*-3 to spend , you have *-1 to keep *-1 putting out products which *T*-2 look novel at the first glance and feel great at the first touch .
Only then can you create demand and stimulate consumption , " <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> avers *T*-1 .
Behind the quest for innovation and change , there needs *-1 to be a great deal of R-AMP-D work , along with a keen nose for the market .
But <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">95 % of Taiwan 's textile firms</COREF> are small or medium - sized enterprises .
<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do not have the facilities or staff 0 *T*-1 to carry on R-AMP-D , and <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> lack the perspective 0 *PRO* to take a broad view of worldwide trends *T*-2 .
Hence in the upgrading process , organizations like <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI</COREF> will play an increasingly important role .

Flexibility v. perfectionism
However , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">G - Fun Industrial Corporation</COREF> general manager Tsai Chiu - hsiung , who *T*-9 worked at <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI</COREF> for many years before *PRO* setting up in business for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> in late 1998</COREF> , has had a different experience .
While at <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Tsai</COREF> headed a project 0 *T*-9 to develop <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the technology for *PRO* making breathable waterproof fabrics</COREF> .
At that time , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says , few manufacturers in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> were both interested in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the technology</COREF> and competent *PRO*-9 to apply <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Later , when <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> team had developed <COREF ID="ectb_1003.part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the process</COREF> *T*-9 , many firms expressed an interest .
But once <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had acquired <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the technology</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">many</COREF> lost money or even went out of business - the results were far from ideal .
" At that time <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> felt very frustrated .
<COREF ID="ectb_1003.part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was clearly a good process , but after *PRO* buying <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the technology</COREF> for a nominal sum , many companies did n't value <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Tsai Chiu - hsiung</COREF> .
On the one hand , the market for breathable waterproof fabrics was not yet mature , and too many companies entering all at once knocked the bottom out of the market ; on the other , manufacturers in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> still lack the concept of *PRO* dedicating production equipment to one product .
For fear of *PRO* putting all their eggs in one basket , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">many firms</COREF> are in the habit of producing whatever <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can get orders for *T*-1 : today it may be waterproof fabric , tomorrow cloth for tarpaulins , and next month purses .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> product mix <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> very varied , with frequent switching .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> makes quality control difficult , so that when <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">firms</COREF> are faced *-1 with a technically demanding product *T*-9 , defects may easily arise .
Worse , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are often unable *PRO*-9 even to identify the cause .
" <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">' Flexibility '</COREF> helps SMEs survive in difficult times , but <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not conducive to the perfectionist attitudes needed * when *PRO* upgrading *T*-9 . "
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Tsai Chiu - hsiung , who *T*-9 urges companies *PRO*-1 to " know when *PRO* to give things up *T*-2</COREF> , " has now been in business for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> for a year , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> is <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the only firm in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> which *T*-3 specializes in *PRO* applying breathable waterproof coatings to fabrics</COREF> .
With more orders than <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can handle *?* , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is now preparing *PRO*-9 to build a new factory at Touliu in Yunlin County .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">G - Fun 's</COREF> micropore breathable coating is a compound containing special water - soluble granules which *T*-9 create <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">tiny pores in the fabric surface</COREF> .
Sweat can evaporate through <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">these pores</COREF> without *PRO* being absorbed * by the fabric , *PRO*-5 improving comfort compared with traditional hydrophilic fabrics which *T*-2 when *PRO* worn * in the rain *T*-1 start *-2 sticking to the body after a time .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">G - Fun</COREF> is also co-operating with <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI</COREF> *PRO*-9 to develop waterproof fabrics with both micropore and hydrophilic characteristics .
At present , most of <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> orders come from Europe and the USA , and are made *-1 into upmarket leisurewear such as climbing or golf apparel which *T*-9 sells for as much as NT$ 8,000 *U* per garment .
Like TCH , <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">G - Fun</COREF> also hopes 0 <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> products can help <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> textile industry upgrade .
" The 21st century will be an age of leisure , and <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese sport and leisurewear fabrics</COREF> have long held first place worldwide .

A short - term view
Another type of new fabric which *T*-9 is in great demand is wicking fabric , based * on fibers with a special cross-section .
The leading volume producer of wicking fibers in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Chung Shing Textile Company</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="20" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> president</COREF> , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">William Shang</COREF></COREF> , explains that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">conventional fibers</COREF> have a round cross-section , but by *PRO* changing <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the fibers '</COREF> physical properties it *EXP*-2 is possible *PRO* to produce <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> with various cross-sectional profiles such as X or Y shapes , which *T*-1 create <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">capillaries along <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the fibers</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> not only quickly wick sweat away from the skin , but also regulate body temperature and allow garments to dry quickly after washing .
However , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the fibers '</COREF> special properties can easily be destroyed *-9 in the various processes 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> go through *T*-1 such as yarn spinning , weaving , dyeing and finishing , so that *PRO* making finished garments requires a high degree of technical sophistication .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Chung Shing</COREF> has launched a fabric named * *PRO* Coolplus *PRO* to compete with <COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Dupont 's equivalent product</COREF> , <COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Coolmax</COREF> .
" *PRO* Developing new fibers is the most important element in *PRO* upgrading the textile industry , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Shang</COREF> .
However , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> acknowledges that although <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">many new products</COREF> are being developed *-9 in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , on closer inspection <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are all copies of products first developed * elsewhere , and so fall some way short of real innovation .
But whereas it used *-9 to take <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese companies</COREF> several years of trial and error *PRO* to figure out how *PRO* to make such products *T*-1 , the gap between <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> European and American competitors is growing ever smaller .
When new products appear overseas *T*-9 it now only takes <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> two to three years *PRO*-1 to bring out an equivalent .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">William Shang</COREF> observes that when <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">most Taiwanese firms</COREF> see <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">something new</COREF> at an overseas exhibition *T*-9 <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will bring back <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">a sample</COREF> , inspect <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> under a high - powered microscope *PRO*-1 to determine the weaving method and have <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> chemically analyzed *-3 *PRO*-1 to find out the composition of the fibers and finishing chemicals .
With <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> long years of manufacturing experience , it *EXP*-1 is then not difficult *PRO* to reproduce <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the product</COREF> with 70 - 80 % accuracy .
However , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Shang</COREF> does not see this as a viable long - term strategy .
" The best strategy for the long - term is still *PRO* to put more effort into basic scientific research , " <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
For example , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> read in Time magazine that because spiders produce the best natural fibers in the world , being both lustrous and resilient , US scientists transferred spider genes into silkworms *PRO*-1 to produce " super silkworms . "
<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">The technique</COREF> succeeded , but because <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the Americans</COREF> were not very interested in *PRO* producing clothing textiles , <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did not commercialize <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
When it comes to this kind of combination of lateral thinking and advanced technology *T*-9 , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> still has some way 0 *PRO* to go *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Shang , currently chairman of <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI 's</COREF> technology committee</COREF> , is well aware of where the obstacle to R-AMP-D lies *T*-3 : " Innovative ideas take time *PRO*-4 to mature , and you have *-2 to <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">accept</COREF> a high degree of uncertainty .
But our environment does not allow <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> notes that industries in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> always pursue short - term profits , so there is never much interest in technologies which *T*-9 are too forward - looking and can not immediately produce saleable products .
As one of 18 industrial institutes under the Ministry of Economic Affairs , <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI</COREF> has some state funding .
But with ever greater budgetary constraints and pressure *PRO* to cover <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own costs , development projects mostly concentrate on <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">firms '</COREF> current needs , and stress the sales and profit 0 <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> generate *T*-1 .
Under such circumstances , epoch - making innovations are unlikely *-9 to emerge .

*PRO* Standardizing colors
Because innovation is so hard 0 *PRO* to achieve *T*-2 , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the highly innovative Sinocolor Book color reference system , which *T*-1 was launched *-1 at <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI 's</COREF> 40th anniversary celebration</COREF> , has been greeted *-9 with great admiration by many .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">The system 's</COREF> inventor</COREF> , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsu Yun - peng</COREF></COREF> , only had a junior high school education , but had researched color matching for 18 years in a dyeing factory .
*PRO*-9 Discovering that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">imported color matching software</COREF> was of little practical use , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu , who *T*-1 did n't know a word of English</COREF> , taught <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *PRO*-2 to program and wrote an improved version of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the software</COREF> .
*PRO* Writing color matching software <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">earned</COREF> <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu Yun - peng</COREF> a lot of money , but <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was not <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> main purpose</COREF> .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> real aim</COREF> was *PRO* to produce a color reference system that *T*-1 was genuinely easy 0 *PRO* to use *T*-3 , *PRO* to overcome the lack of color standardization which *T*-2 had long plagued the dyeing industry .
*PRO*-1 To pursue <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">this goal</COREF> <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> quit <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> job , moved to the suburbs of Kuishan in Taoyuan County , and began *-1 to spend 18 hours a day *PRO*-1 studying the problem .
Quite apart from the difficulties of *PRO* keeping <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> family *PRO*-3 fed , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> often was n't even sure how old <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> three children</COREF> were *T*-1 and what year of school <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were in *T*-2 .
Finally <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> used a three - dimensional model *PRO* to create a regularly graded , finely differentiated color reference system covering 20,000 colors , each with clear " color coordinates . "
These features are unmatched by any of the systems currently in common use worldwide , which *T*-1 only define up to 3,000 colors .
The textile industry 's efforts *PRO* to upgrade are gradually showing some results , but *PRO*-1 looking at the situation overall , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">CTI</COREF> president Yao Hsing - chuan</COREF> is still somewhat worried .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> comments that the majority of companies still have the traditional mindset of *PRO* pursuing low - cost , high - volume production .
<COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is the world 's third biggest producer of man - made fibers , but <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> only produces a small range of mass - market fibers for apparel fabrics , to the almost total neglect of the hundred or so other high - added - value , special fibers on the market such as high - strength fibers for bullet - proof fabrics , elastic fibers or superalloy aerospace fibers .
Again , when it comes <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="142" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> biggest export item</COREF> , <COREF ID="142" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">finished fabrics</COREF> ,</COREF> *T*-9 <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> too are largely limited *-1 to apparel fabrics , with few companies getting involved *-2 in <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">other areas</COREF> despite <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> potential .
For instance , <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has been struck *-1 by many landslides in recent years , and requires large quantities of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">geotextiles</COREF> - <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">heavy - grade textiles</COREF> laid * under or around civil engineering structures *PRO* to prevent erosion by groundwater movement .
The currently planned high - speed rail system alone is expected *-9 to require several million yards of geotextiles .
But Taiwanese companies are inexperienced in this area , and *PRO* sending products overseas for quality certification tests is time consuming and complicated , so local companies can only stand and watch as the entire market goes to imported products .

Bullet - proof fabrics ?
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Geotextiles</COREF> ?
Are <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> part of the textile industry ?
Indeed <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *?* .
Yao Hsing - chuan says that textile industry products have <COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">three main fields of application</COREF> : <COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">apparel , furnishings and industrial</COREF> .
At present , over 95 % by value of ROC textile industry output is accounted for *-1 by apparel products with low added value .
By contrast , in the USA textiles for clothing and industrial applications are produced *-9 in equal quantities , and industrial textiles include a wide variety of different products , many of which *T*-1 are technically demanding and command profit margins with which most apparel products can not compare *T*-2 .
Hence <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI</COREF> has already made it *EXP*-1 one of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> major goals *PRO* to encourage <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">firms</COREF> *PRO*-2 to shift <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> orientation towards <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">industrial textiles</COREF> .
The development of stainless - steel fibers is one success story in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">this area</COREF> .
From false teeth to space suits
Dotted *-2 among the paddy fields of Taichung County 's Houli Rural Township are *T*-1 <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">many metal - clad buildings which *T*-9 house a variety of factories producing such products as plastics , furniture and electronic components</COREF> .
Among <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> is *T*-1 <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">King 's Metal Fiber Technologies Company</COREF> , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the only firm in <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> which *T*-9 draws fibers from stainless steel</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">King 's</COREF> president</COREF> <COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rocky Chang</COREF></COREF> is known *-1 to all as Dr. Chang , and is indeed still a practicing dentist .
A decade or so ago , while <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was studying in <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> developed an interest in metallurgy , and hoped *PRO*-9 to develop the use of metals in tooth implants .
Later <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> learned that stainless steels have an enormously wide range of applications in the textiles , industrial and military fields .
But <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could not find a partner 0 *PRO* to work with *T*-2 in <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> , so <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> returned to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and began *-1 collaborating with <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the CTI</COREF> .
Today , not only is <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">King 's</COREF> on a par with the large overseas manufacturers in terms of filament drawing technology , but *PRO*-9 to assist local downstream manufacturers in *PRO* using <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> products , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has also set up metal fiber yarn spinning and fabric weaving plants , and is making efforts in the area of nonwoven fabrics .
*PRO*-9 Stroking <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the silver - gray ringlets which *T*-1 are twice as fine as human hair</COREF> , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> says that <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">these soft , flexible fibers of high - grade steel</COREF> can not only make fashion fabrics glisten with a mysterious modern sheen suitable for a millennium party , but - thanks to <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">metals '</COREF> outstanding capacity *PRO* to shield and conduct electromagnetic waves , and <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ability *PRO* to withstand high temperatures and acid or caustic environments - <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> also have a wide range of applications in many industries .
For instance , at a recent international furniture show in Taipei , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">King 's</COREF> exhibited sound insulating panels containing metal fibers , which hi - fi buffs can install *T*-9 *PRO*-1 to produce an excellent sound studio effect .
Cellphone cases of metal fabric can shield users from the electromagnetic radiation 0 the phones produce *T*-9 ; and in the clean rooms of silicon wafer fabs , where dust particles attracted * by static electricity on clothing are the biggest bugbear *T*-1 , there is a host of applications for anti-static fabrics , from workers ' clothing and footwear to trolleys , conveyor belts and wall coverings .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Rocky Chang</COREF> says that before <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">King 's</COREF> started *-9 producing metal fibers , the market was divided *-1 up between a few foreign companies which *T*-2 charged high prices and produced only small quantities of products .
Furthermore , when <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese users</COREF> had difficulties with production *T*-9 <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did not know who *PRO* to turn to *T*-1 for help .
*PRO*-9 Looking into the future , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> hopes that as a key material , stainless steel fiber can have a " locomotive " effect , *PRO* encouraging various industries in <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *PRO*-1 to develop a range of different products .
