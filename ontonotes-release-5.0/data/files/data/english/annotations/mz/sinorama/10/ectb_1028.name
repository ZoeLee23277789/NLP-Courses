Money for Nothin' ...
But It 's Not Risk Free
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Li</ENAMEX> / photos by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh Chi - kuang</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Newell</ENAMEX> -RRB-
It is said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> hottest subjects in post-martial law <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> have been sex and personal money management , which certainly goes to show the degree of openness and pluralism in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's society .
Moreover , like sex , personal money management is something that many people only vaguely understand , that they feel uncertain about committing themselves to , and that leaves them feeling tired and empty .
Personal money management is now a national sport .
The wealthy hope to roll their money over , while those less well off are trying to make a small pile of their own .
But what kind of money management approach is best suited to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the current era</ENAMEX> ?
How can one win in the investment game without losing the game of life in the process ?
" Earning money is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> priority , spending money is a sin , long live personal money management ! "
Thus declares a poster on the wall of a certain " Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> , " a secretary in a trucking company in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pingtung</ENAMEX> .
Every night before going to sleep she turns on her computer to check out the closing share prices for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Taiwan Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> and the opening figures for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> exchanges , and then makes a quick calculation in her head of her total wealth .
This woman , who is nearing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30</ENAMEX> and has been working for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years</ENAMEX> , has a " personal value " which is still <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than NT$ 600,000</ENAMEX> , so in order to build up a fund for investing , she will not buy a house or go abroad for travel , and she 's becoming a Scrooge in the eyes of her friends .
Yet , all her discipline and her enthusiasm can not guarantee that she makes money .
And sometimes when she looks at the poster on her wall , she feels as if she is being mocked .
If I knew then what I know now ...
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu Li - chih</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25 - year</ENAMEX> - old teacher , is another e-generation personal money management enthusiast .
Even before he did his compulsory military service , he began making investments of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 3,000</ENAMEX> per month in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> technology fund .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> , the fund has gone from taking losses to taking off ; though it has levelled off somewhat lately , the returns have been excellent .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> declares himself to be " a faithful believer " in all manner of personal money management books , and when he has free time in summer vacation , he spends an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 hours</ENAMEX> a week looking at investment information .
His greatest regret is that he began his financial career too late .
He says : " If I had used my allowance every year from the time I was small to invest in a fund , at the rate of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 30,000</ENAMEX> per year , after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> , there would be quite a lot of money right now . "
Becoming increasingly agitated , he adds that if he had understood money management early on , he could have invested right after the big stock market collapse in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , and he would be rich today instead of regretful .
It looks like more and more of the e-generation are getting into investing .
But do they know what they are doing ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Chien</ENAMEX> of the money management website called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">JP Investment Clinic</ENAMEX> strikes a cautionary note : " I do n't think the education system has fulfilled its responsibility to teach people how to manage their money . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien</ENAMEX> points out that school textbooks only teach moral lessons like " <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</ENAMEX> saved is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a penny</ENAMEX> earned , " which are not exactly what the real world demands <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">these days</ENAMEX> .
In contrast , many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> children understand a bit about money management from early on .
For example , a child in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">her early teens</ENAMEX> might babysit for the neighbors or cut lawns , and then put the money in a mutual fund .
Some investment websites have games for children to teach them about various investment instruments and portfolios .
These treat personal money management as a serious life skill that all modern people should know .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien</ENAMEX> says that the situation is just like sex education in the past .
They give it only the most cursory treatment in schools , but most people have a strong desire to find out about it , so as a result they have to pick up what they can from the newspapers or cable TV .
The result of the lack of a proper investment outlook is that speculation is rampant .
According to statistics of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Finance</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">87.5 %</ENAMEX> of the trading volume on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> stock exchange comes from individual investors .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> turnover was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">288 %</ENAMEX> -LRB- that is , total trading volume was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.88</ENAMEX> times the total value of the market -RRB- , which , though considerably down from nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">600 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years before</ENAMEX> , remained <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> times higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York stock exchange</ENAMEX> .
Despite numerous painful lessons in the past , the habit of chasing a rising market and cutthroat selling in a falling market has proven difficult to change .
A new climate for the e-generation
Fortunately , over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last three years</ENAMEX> foreign investors have brought some new ideas into the country .
Although they still engage in " hit - and - run " high - volume trading for quick gains , at least most foreign investors ignore gossip and do n't touch the more speculative stocks .
Rather , they put more emphasis on the fundamentals of a given company or industry .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Chien</ENAMEX> notes that foreign firms have also introduced risk management ideas like " having a well - rounded portfolio " -LRB- i.e. " do n't put all your eggs in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> basket " -RRB- .
These have had a positive impact on the local stock market , and have given the investment activities of the e-generation a more rational foundation than those of their parents .
The chief characteristics of the current wave of e-generation personal money management are great ambition , reliance on expert analysis , and diversification of investment targets .
Nevertheless , the hottest investments are always changing , and perhaps no amount of rational analysis or detailed information will be able to change this .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chia Chen - i</ENAMEX> , senior executive vice president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Individual Banking Sector at Bank Sinopac</ENAMEX> -LRB- which <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> created a stir in the industry by introducing the world 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> - in - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> money management account -RRB- has been observing the evolution of the financial environment in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> , and offers the following thoughts about trends in money management .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chia</ENAMEX> recalls that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</ENAMEX> , people were too poor to have any money to manage ; there were also fears of war , and so any money people did have they quickly exchanged for gold or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> dollars on the black market .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</ENAMEX> , faced with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> oil crises and inflation , the idea of buying property to preserve value became widespread , and those who could afford it bought land and houses .
At that time , the stock market had only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a hundred or so</ENAMEX> listed companies , and its fate depended on a few manipulators behind the scenes .
It was seen as a " cannibalistic market " which scared off most citizens .
The past is gone
The real fad for personal money management only hit <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</ENAMEX> .
It was then that the country 's accumulated economic resources began to come to the surface .
The huge trade surplus built up over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> caused the NT dollar to appreciate , and attracted a huge amount of speculative foreign money into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
The stock market index rose from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">600</ENAMEX> or so in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 12,000</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , the price of property rose from an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 71,800</ENAMEX> per ping <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">-LRB- about 3.3 square meters -RRB-</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 284,500</ENAMEX> per ping in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> .
At that time , great opportunities for making money stared one right in the face .
In pursuit of overnight wealth , many people mortgaged their property to buy stocks , and then used their stocks as collateral to borrow more money , creating a vicious cycle that laid the foundation for the burst bubble and huge debts of later years .
But , having reviewed the past , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chia Chen - i</ENAMEX> declares : " In money management , you can only look to the future ; there 's no point in regretting what 's gone . "
Indeed , in the era of the Internet , with everything moving much faster , investment indicators like product popularity and employment trends can change overnight .
Those who can not see the trends or who can not react fast enough are doomed to be the losers in the wealth game .
Take for example the case of Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> .
Widowed at an early age , for over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years</ENAMEX> she supported her family as an independent real estate broker .
Her success made her very confident about her understanding of the property market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Six years ago</ENAMEX> , she decided to help the family of her younger brother , who contracted a terminal illness , to buy a new house .
At the time , the price of high - rise apartments in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Tanshui New Town</ENAMEX> had fallen from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 220,000</ENAMEX> per ping to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 150,000</ENAMEX> .
Congratulating herself on getting a low price , and confident that the market would rebound , Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> happily put down the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> payment and watched her brother 's family move in .
However , it was about this time that many new projects - started earlier by construction firms hoping to take advantage of peak prices - came on the market .
The number of empty units rose to over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one million</ENAMEX> .
Next , increased cross-strait tensions put a further damper on the property market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">The September 21 earthquake</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> was the final straw .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> you can find high - rise apartments in <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tanshui New Town</ENAMEX> for as little as NT$ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">110,000</ENAMEX> per ping .
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> 's brother 's family is stuck with a heavy mortgage , and there are constant recriminations between Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> and her nieces and nephews.
Will the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> property market inevitably recover ?
Not necessarily .
Looking around the world , at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , and even mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> , there are countless examples of long - term downturns in the housing market .
The popular book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Die Broke</ENAMEX> notes that the sharp rise in housing prices in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s and 1970s</ENAMEX> was due to underlying structural factors :
The large generation of " baby boomers " were starting careers and families , thereby increasing demand for housing .
At that time , some of the older generation about to retire happily sold their houses to the younger at high prices .
The large profits they earned attracted numerous speculators into the market , and prices were driven even higher , encouraging construction of ever more homes .
But now that most of the baby boomers have their own homes , and the current " e-generation " is smaller , who are all those extra homes going to be sold to ?
Snafu
The upshot of all this is , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsu Yen - shan</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Finance</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University</ENAMEX> , cautions : " There are no absolute experts at money management . "
So - called experts are simply those who have particular knowledge about a certain sector in a certain place at a certain time .
But you know the old saying : " People have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> feet , but money has <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> . "
Trends change faster than most people can anticipate .
No wonder the " stock masters " featured on cable TV usually disappear from view after a brief reign , only to be replaced by equally short - lived successors .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , perhaps brainwashed by money management dogma that says " the early bird gets the worm , " investors have swarmed like bees for the latest fads , sometimes jumping in even before the true value is known .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASDAQ</ENAMEX> index , which has a history of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">29 years</ENAMEX> behind it , suddenly surged from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2800</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October of last year</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 5000</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March of this year</ENAMEX> .
Telecommunications , Internet , and biotechnology stocks soared .
The price - to - earnings ratio of some individual stocks reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> , which some ridiculed as the " price - to - dream ratio . "
" Investors sometimes act as if they do n't care about a company 's current losses , but simply put all their faith in the distant future .
Unfortunately , the farther in the future something is , the more likely it is that expectations will be wrong , " points out <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiu Shean - bii</ENAMEX> , a professor of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University</ENAMEX> .
Beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-March of this year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NASDAQ</ENAMEX> high - tech stocks plummeted .
For many investors , earnings accumulated over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> disappeared in a matter of weeks .
The misguided idea that " what is new is better " also has been a problem in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
A certain " Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wang</ENAMEX> , " who works in the government , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> thought he would jump on the bandwagon for telecom and Internet stocks .
He borrowed money to purchase <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</ENAMEX> blocks of shares , at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 13</ENAMEX> per share , of fixed - line Internet network stocks , which had n't yet even been listed .
When the price fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 11</ENAMEX> per share , he still did n't worry , thinking that " so long as I do n't sell , the loss wo n't be realized . "
Little did he expect that the new government would clamp down on illegal trading in fixed - line network stocks .
Suddenly his whole investment - well over <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 1 million</ENAMEX> - has been frozen , and all he can do is stand on the sidelines in a state of panic .
To be sure , ignorance of new trends is not recommended , but looking too far into the future can also lead to disappointment .
Indeed , in this information era , money management may even be getting more difficult .
Strange to say , but the explosion of money management information , which should in theory make investors ' lives easier , does not .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiu Shean - bii</ENAMEX> says : " There 's plenty of information out there , and there are so - called experts everywhere .
But the result is that investors do n't know what to believe , and find it even more difficult to make a decision . "
Moreover , often even the best information and analysis is no match for sheer luck .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabula Chang</ENAMEX> , editor - in - chief of the money management website <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SmartNet</ENAMEX> , describes a case in point .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the hottest stocks was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Quanta Computers</ENAMEX> , which reached <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">800</ENAMEX> per share .
The story goes that there was an old grandmother who followed the crowd in and out of the stock , earning a huge amount in the process .
Afterwards , she asked : " What I still do n't understand is , how can selling pork jerky be so profitable ? "
It turns out that she thought she was investing in a dried - pork company of the same name , and those who heard her question nearly fainted with disbelief .
Money management madness
The fever for money management has in fact disrupted the lives of many people , and brought a lot of headaches .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Liu</ENAMEX> , associate director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> branch of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UBS</ENAMEX> , who has written a number of books on money management , says that there is no turning back .
Whenever some people get ahead , others will follow , and no amount of calls for simpler lifestyles or new value systems can stop them .
The reason is very simple .
" The money management fever is a natural product of changing times . "
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> , individualism and the rise of urban commercial society have broken down the support networks of traditional agricultural society .
In addition , since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> has been swept up in the globalization of capitalism .
Rural society has disintegrated , and traditional industrial sectors have withered , as newly rising electronics and information industries have appeared one after another .
These rapid changes have brought the threat of unemployment or early retirement to many individuals .
In order to cope with the increasing uncertainty of life , it is necessary for people to build up a nest egg .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> says : " If you have <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 30 million</ENAMEX> in the bank , you do n't care whether you have to retire or not .
What 's important is that you do n't have to worry about the future , and live in fear that a sudden loss of your salary could ruin your life . " Of course , everyone feels a different sense of urgency about the uncertainties of life .
Sometimes , in fact , this can become a source of interpersonal friction .
" Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> " of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pingtung</ENAMEX> worries that her father , soon to retire at age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">60</ENAMEX> , does n't think much about money , and his expected retirement plus savings will be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">less than NT$ 4 million</ENAMEX> -LRB- about US$ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">120,000</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
You manage , I benefit ?
As Miss <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> does not hesitate to say : " My Mom and Dad still think that it would only mean an extra set of chopsticks on the table for them to live with their daughter .
It seems they have n't realized yet that they may live to be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">85</ENAMEX> .
They have n't made any preparations for living expenses , vacations , or the enormous medical expenses that can be expected over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next 25 years</ENAMEX> . "
She has encouraged her parents to put part of their savings into a mutual fund or the like , but without success .
Indeed , the issue has become a sore point between her and her mother .
Meanwhile , the changes in the larger environment that are making people anxious about their economic security are boons to companies trying to market financial products .
A certain <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> bank has recently been doing " carpet bombing " advertising with slogans like " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> out of every <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> people wants to retire <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years early</ENAMEX> , but has n't yet begun a financial plan ! " or " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> of parents want to send their children abroad to study , but one - <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> of these do n't know how much money they should prepare ! "
It is said that these ads have been very effective .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Yi - fen</ENAMEX> , vice president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Individual Banking Department at Fubon Bank</ENAMEX> , speaking as someone who has been closely following this problem from the sidelines , reminds consumers that no matter what the source - advertising , websites , or whatever - though advice may be cloaked in a halo of expertise , the motive is to sell products and to earn money from the financial activities of clients .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> says : " It 's like those ads for milk that emphasize how fearful osteoporosis is .
The problem is , they do n't tell you that milk is by no means the only way to prevent this , or even the most effective . "
It ai n't over till it 's over
Another factor driving " investment anxiety " is peer pressure . "
If a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 - year</ENAMEX> - old does not have a securities account , he wo n't be able to engage in conversations with his peers about the market , so naturally he will feel out of touch , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cabula Chang</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> admits that he still lives in a rented house in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tanshui</ENAMEX> .
His wife wonders why his colleagues in the financial management community are multi-millionaires , while he still has not had his rendezvous with fortune .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> tells his wife that one should not compare oneself to others .
Their success may be temporary or even illusory .
A number of his friends who had insider information were quite proud of themselves when they profited from the rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Taiwan Pineapple</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 200</ENAMEX> .
But within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two years</ENAMEX> , the stock collapsed and became worthless paper .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> recalls an inexperienced reporter who got sucked in to the market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> by some irresistible insider information .
He even mortgaged his house and persuaded his friends to invest with him .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</ENAMEX> , he still has not got his head above water .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> says , " The longer I 'm in this business , the more I feel that you ca n't get anywhere by trying to get ahead quickly . "
Investment options are like churning whirlpools ; of course you enjoy the ride as long as you are on top of the water , but currents shift , and eventually you may get sucked down .
" In investing , until the final moment , you never know whether you 've won or lost . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Liu</ENAMEX> , who personally feels little anxiety about money management , points out that one of her core principles for investing is to not compare herself with others .
" This is because I know that opportunities to make money come and go .
If I do n't make a lot this wave , there 'll be another wave later . "
She says that anxiety rises in direct proportion to a person 's expectations and desires .
The more you want , the more anxiety you feel , and the greater will be the sense of disappointment if you fail .
In other words , anxiety derives from greed .
" If you buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TSMC</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150</ENAMEX> hoping it will go up to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">220</ENAMEX> within a couple of months because that 's what you need to make your final house payment , then it only goes up to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">200</ENAMEX> , you 'll feel dissatisfied , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liu</ENAMEX> .
This sense of disappointment is completely due to the lack of a proper money management outlook .
People in middle age invest in hopes of finding a sense of personal security .
But members of the e-generation often have more specific objectives in mind .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin Yu - ting</ENAMEX> , currently a sophomore in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Financial Management</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University</ENAMEX> , puts the money she makes working part - time into the market .
She says that she has " a specific plan for each period of time , such as going abroad , or buying a car . "
So her aim is " to manage my money so that I can spend it ! "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin</ENAMEX> 's classmate <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ou Chien - ming</ENAMEX> says that he has always wanted to save money to go traveling with his girlfriend .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , after vacillating for quite a while , he finally borrowed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 80,000</ENAMEX> from his mother to invest in stocks , under the assumption that , by putting to use what he was learning in school , it would n't be that hard to make a good return .
Alas , he put his faith in the predictions of a certain investment adviser , and put everything he had into securities stocks , which stagnated .
After the election of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Shui - bian</ENAMEX> as president , he mistakenly assumed that the market would go down , and sold everything without even looking at the share prices .
He ended up selling at the low point , and his dream of going abroad is even farther out of reach than it was before .
Healthy money management
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chiu Shean - bii</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University</ENAMEX> was told in a recent meeting with the general manager of certain large <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> commercial bank : " <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asians</ENAMEX> always ask : ' Is the market going to go up or down <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">tomorrow</ENAMEX> ? '
But investment advisors are not weather forecasters , and we do n't pretend that we can know the future . "
This banker says that his money management target is not to make a specific profit within a specific time , but to use a variety of financial instruments - including defensive investments like insurance and reliable ones like savings , as well as an active investment portfolio - to appropriately diversify his assets .
He seeks to " build a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Noah</ENAMEX> 's ark .
When the weather is good , you can make a little more progress , but when storms hit , you can ride them out . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen Yi - fen</ENAMEX> , who comes across all manner of money management plans every day , often wonders about the meaning of it all .
She says that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> banks are always talking about how they want to provide every individual with tools to " intelligently manage money . "
For example , they provide credit cards that award bonus points , housing loans with built - in short - term overdrafts for investment , and even mutual fund accounts that will automatically invest a specific amount at fixed times .
But how much money is enough ?
That depends on the values of the individual .
" Each individual should choose a lifestyle and belief system that they feel comfortable with , and not just follow the crowd , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chen</ENAMEX> .
After all , in a pluralized society , there should be <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</ENAMEX> definition of success .
Recently there was a news story about the old author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Tuo - wu</ENAMEX> having to sell lottery tickets on the street .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> financial expert took <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> as an object lesson to " warn " people to learn how to manage their money .
Yet , looking at this another way , if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> had spent his youth worrying about accumulating money , he would not have had the experiences he did and made his way from being an ordinary soldier to writing such moving works .
In the end , there are no numbers that can validly measure what has been gained in life , and what lost .
It is said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> biggest causes of family arguments <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> have been differences over who to vote for in the presidential election , and over what stocks to buy .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Liu</ENAMEX> reminds us , money management , like life itself , is an accumulation of small experiences , a long road with ups and downs , and so should be faced with equanimity .
After all , is n't the point of making money to have a better life ?
