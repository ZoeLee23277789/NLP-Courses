What Price Public Art ?
-LRB- Tsai Wen - ting / tr. * by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
The art market in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has tended *-1 to focus on oil painting and ink - and - wash , with relatively little interest in sculpture , photography , ceramics and multimedia .
However , tens of millions of NT dollars have now become available for work in a range of forms , under the provisions of a 1992 law requiring at least one percent of the budget for major infrastructure projects *PRO*-2 to be spent *-2 on public art .
As a result , artists from <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and abroad have been scrabbling for a slice of the public art pie .
In Taipei , 1997 was designated *-1 as the Year of Public Art , and the following year experimental installations went on display at nine cultural centers around <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> , chosen * by <COREF ID="ectb_1037.part-000-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Council for Cultural Affairs</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1037.part-000-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">CCA</COREF> -RRB- .
1998 also saw the adoption of new measures governing the installation of such works .
As public art began *-1 to proliferate , university departments of art , environment and architecture , *PRO*-2 spurred *-2 by demand , began *-2 offering public art courses .

Golden opportunity
The development of a number of major infrastructure projects , including <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei</COREF> MRT system</COREF> , the Second Northern Freeway and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the new terminal at <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CKS Airport</COREF></COREF> , released millions - even hundreds of millions - of NT dollars for *PRO* spending on public art , *PRO*-1 creating a golden opportunity for eager artists .
During 1999 , 30 works of public art were completed *-1 in line with official provisions , at a cost of NT$ 40 million *U* .
But <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the budget for yet - to - be - installed * works</COREF> *ICH*-1 is even more staggering : <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">NT$ 100 million *U* for public art at <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the new <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CKS Airport</COREF> terminal</COREF> alone , NT$ 85 million *U* for spending by the Kaohsiung port authority , and NT$ 80 million *U* for stations along the Wanhua - Panchiao branch of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei 's</COREF> MRT network</COREF></COREF> .
At a time of bleak economic prospects , public art commissions have become a beacon for artists .
No wonder 0 some prefer *PRO*-1 to enter public art contests rather than accept the honor of selection committee membership .
The fact that the contest for nine works 0 *T*-2 to be placed *-2 along <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei 's</COREF> " Tunhwa Art Corridor , " organized * by <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei 's</COREF> Urban Development Department , drew entries from over 130 artists , shows how intense the competition can be *T*-1 .
And it is sculptors who *T*-1 have been the biggest beneficiaries of the new policies , since three - dimensional art is the most suitable form for installation in open spaces : of the 55 public art works completed * in 1998 , 40 *T*-2 were works of sculpture .

Art engineering ?
At present , public art is chosen *-1 through one of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">four methods</COREF> : <COREF ID="6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">open competition , invitation *PRO* to tender , commissioning , and direct purchase</COREF> .
The process has *-1 to involve <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">a selection committee from the CCA or relevant cultural department at the local level , comprising artists , architects , landscape designers , art educationalists and so on</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">The committee</COREF> appraises works for artistic quality , suitability for the location , safety and feasibility .
Entries which *T*-1 pass the first round are presented *-2 for public demonstration and discussion among the community , so as *PRO* to avoid subsequent protests .
Unlike those working with other forms of art , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the creators of public art</COREF> need *-1 to have a grasp of architectural structure , environmental scenery and even accounting procedure .
Artistic conception alone is not enough .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will be submitting expenditure claims and dealing with issues including long - term maintenance and cleaning , and maybe utility supply .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">A number of artists</COREF> have thus found it *EXP*-1 helpful *PRO* to pool <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> talents , *PRO* setting up workshops geared * chiefly to the production of public art .
Priceless art ?
Transparency and professionalism in the public art selection process should be beneficial to the overall art environment in Taiwan .
But Huang Wen - ching , a number of whose works *T*-2 have been successfully selected *-2 , points out that <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">artists</COREF> still have *-1 to overcome frequent misunderstandings , such as when the cost of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> material
