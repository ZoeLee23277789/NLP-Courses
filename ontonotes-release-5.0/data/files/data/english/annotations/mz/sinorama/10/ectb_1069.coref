<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Middle age</COREF> and the changes 0 <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> brings *T*-1 are like a revolving door .
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Many people</COREF> peacefully go through <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , *PRO*-1 growing wiser and losing <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rough edges .
A minority do n't know whether *PRO* to advance or retreat and get caught *-1 in <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> like a trap .
Middle age is a time where one wears more hats than at any other time in one 's life *T*-1 , when one 's responsibilities are heaviest *T*-2 .
As a result , <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">the crises experienced * by a minority of middle - aged people</COREF> can involve a lot of other people , so <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> impact can not be overlooked *-1 .
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Middle age</COREF> , <COREF ID="207" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">those years between 40 and 60</COREF> , is both the time of life of greatest glory and the time of life that *T*-1 's easiest 0 *PRO* to overlook *T*-2 .
In comparison to youth or old age , the middle years are often thought of *-1 as the time when <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">power , ability , wealth , and physical strength</COREF> are all at or near <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> peak , so that one has no excuse for *PRO* feeling melancholy *T*-2 .
Even if there are <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">problems</COREF> , it *EXP*-2 is commonly thought *-1 that one should be able *PRO*-3 to resolve <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> by oneself , notes *T*-4 <COREF ID="253" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chiu Chia - li</COREF> , <COREF ID="253" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of the Hwo Chyuan Pastoral Counseling Center</COREF> , who *T*-5 has worked on many middle - aged cases .
Social bias <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-000-E7" TYPE="IDENT">makes</COREF> <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">many of the middle aged</COREF> afraid *PRO*-1 to discuss <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> problems .
<COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-000-E7" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is particularly the case for <COREF ID="269" TYPE="IDENT">men , who *T*-1 generally find it *EXP*-2 difficult *PRO*-1 to talk about <COREF ID="269" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> feelings</COREF> .
But by *PRO* keeping everything inside , <COREF ID="269" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may cause irreparable harm to <COREF ID="269" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> health .
In recent years cancer , sudden death and suicide have become all too common during middle age , which *T*-1 shows that the psychological problems of the middle - aged should not be overlooked *-2 .

How do you safely pass through the changes of the middle years *T*-1 ?
Here are *T*-1 a few suggestions :
1. *PRO* Live well at every stage of life
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Li Liang - che</COREF> , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a professor of psychology at National Chengchi University</COREF></COREF> , looks at the question from the angle of developmental psychology .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> points out that the path of life is continuous : everyone moves from infancy and childhood , to youth and middle age .
*PRO* Smoothly passing through any period of life helps *PRO*-1 make *PRO* getting through the next period easier .
In other words , the people most at risk during middle age are those who *T*-1 have had difficulties earlier in life .
Foreign research shows that those with high social and economic status and with ample financial resources bear up better during crisis and have more ways 0 *PRO* to get out of trouble *T*-1 .
Is it *EXP*-1 too late *PRO* to start * talking about these problems when you are already middle - aged *T*-3 ?
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang Der - chung</COREF> , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an associate professor in the Department of Living Science at National Open University who *T*-1 worked at a counseling hotline for over a decade</COREF> , argues that any step in the right direction is worthwhile , no matter when you start *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Middle - aged problems</COREF> are rather predictable , and <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not hard 0 *PRO* to avoid *T*-1 .
Are you worried that your marriage is growing stale ?
Then no matter how busy you are *T*-1 , you 've got *PRO*-2 to set aside some time 0 *PRO* to be with your spouse *T*-3 .
Are you worried about *PRO* losing your job ?
*PRO* Then start * developing a second skill and get into the habit of *PRO* saving and managing your money .
Are you worried about how *PRO* to care for <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">your parents</COREF> when <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get old and sick *T*-2 *T*-1 ?
Then *PRO* spend more time with <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , and encourage <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to get more exercise and take care of <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
There are so many things 0 *PRO* to be concerned about *T*-1 during middle age that you had better *PRO*-2 get an early start .
Otherwise , you 'll end up *-1 being overwhelmed *-1 .

2. *PRO* Start over
In China it *EXP*-3 used *-1 to be said *-1 that middle age was the period when one was " heir to the ancient sages and the teacher of posterity *T*-2 . "
But now times are changing so fast that perhaps the lessons of past experience are no longer suitable for *PRO* solving today 's problems .
*PRO* To assume a posture of superiority based * on one 's seniority will make one despised .
Hence , it *EXP*-1 is necessary *PRO* to cast aside one 's old self and start over .
Chiu notes that <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">many middle - aged who *T*-1 have worked diligently for years *PRO*-1 to attain management positions</COREF> look down on the younger generation for *PRO* <COREF ID="ectb_1069-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">being</COREF> reckless and disorganized , but <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't realize that creativity and energy may be ready *PRO*-2 to explode from underneath <COREF ID="ectb_1069-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">these flaws</COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Stuck *-1 in the past and full of bitterness , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may end up *-1 getting discarded *-1 onto the scrap heap of history .
With each new era , role models change .
Until the new role models have been established *-1 , it *EXP*-2 is important *PRO* to maintain flexibility .
For instance , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">today 's middle - aged Chinese women</COREF> are the first 0 *T*-1 to have obtained advanced degrees and to have come in contact with the women 's liberation movement .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> set high expectations for <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> , but <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> disappointments are likewise large .
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Many women</COREF> are torn *-1 between conflicting desires : *PRO* to be good homemakers like <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mothers and to have successful careers like <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> fathers .
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> candles are burning at both ends , because <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are trying *PRO*-1 to live up to two old role models rather than *PRO* establishing a new one for <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
Then there are <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">men who *T*-1 insist upon *PRO* being strict fathers and disciplinarians or staying at the same company until <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> retire</COREF> .
And there are women who *T*-1 are determined *-1 to play the role of the traditional Chinese wife and mother .
*PRO*-1 Ignoring the changing times , <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> place tremendous pressure on <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .

3. *PRO* Turn the focus from outside to inside
Life is a process that *T*-1 moves from the " outward " to the " inward , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Alice Lu</COREF> , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of the International Family Life Education Center ,</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-3 getting to the heart of the matter .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Lu</COREF> explains that as children <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> yearn for the affection of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> parents ; as adolescents <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want the affirmation of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> peers ; and as adults , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> set <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sights on educational qualifications , *PRO* finding a good job , *PRO* making money , *PRO* marrying a good spouse and so forth .
Everyone puts <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the emphasis</COREF> on outward manifestations of success , and <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">this emphasis on the glitter of outward achievement</COREF> continues up to middle age .
" By <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-003-E2" TYPE="IDENT">middle age</COREF> , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> have gotten from the outside world just about all 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can *?* *T*-2 , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Lu</COREF> .
" What <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have n't attained *T*-3 yet <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> probably wo n't attain *T*-4 ever , so it 's not worth *PRO* getting all worked up about it .
<COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-003-E2" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is the time of life when the doubts set in *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Many middle - aged people</COREF> begin *-1 to ask <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> , " Is this really what I want *T*-2 ?
What *T*-1 has been the point of all my hard striving ? "
When the doubts come *T*-1 , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">some people</COREF> continue *-2 trying *PRO*-2 to find answers from outside , *PRO*-2 thinking that everything would be fine if <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could just change jobs or wives !
But then <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> rashly switch jobs or foolishly get involved *-1 in an affair *PRO*-1 only to find that <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've just made things worse .
" In <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">middle age</COREF> you start *-1 to listen to what *T*-2 's going on inside , " says *T*-3 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Lu</COREF> .
" <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's the time of life when you start *-2 to hone your skills at *PRO* conversing with your soul *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-003-E3" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> ask <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-003-E3" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> : Am I truly happy ?
Do I like the person 0 I see *T*-1 in the mirror ?
Why ?
What dreams can I pursue *T*-1 ?
At this point , there is no longer any need *PRO* to try *PRO* to measure oneself against outside standards .
Instead it *EXP*-1 's more important *PRO* to accept oneself and attempt *PRO* to find an inner balance .
" One need not *-1 compare one 's inner achievements with those of other people , " notes *T*-2 Chiu .
<COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-003-E8" TYPE="IDENT">Everyone</COREF> 's circumstances and personalities are different , and <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-003-E8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> place different expectations on <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-003-E8" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
It 's not a matter of *PRO* being better or worse than anyone else , and there 's no need *PRO* to follow the currents of fashion .
Everyone is unique .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Morris Chang</COREF> was in <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fifties when <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> became an entrepreneur and founded Taiwan Semiconductor *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Many others at the same time in life</COREF> have opted *PRO*-1 to take early retirement and find a guru in India , work as a volunteer , or do whatever else <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-2 to do *T*-3 .
In the modern age when people value different things *T*-1 , you can find a purely personal kind of happiness and success .

4. *PRO* Realistically strive for one 's dreams
When *PRO* focusing inward *T*-1 , many dreams that *T*-2 have long been discarded *-2 will end up *-3 floating to the surface .
At such times , one should remember *PRO*-1 to ask oneself three questions :
" What do I want *T*-2 ? " " What can I do *T*-3 ? " And " What must I do and have *T*-4 ? "
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Chang Der - chung</COREF> reminds <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> to think clearly about <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> needs</COREF> , and then think about the costs .
Will *PRO* meeting <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">these personal needs</COREF> necessarily come into conflict with *PRO* meeting one 's responsibilities ?
Is there some way that the two can be accomplished *-1 simultaneously *T*-2 ?
When *PRO* facing problems at work in Taiwan *T*-1 , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">many people</COREF> decide *PRO*-2 to change careers or even to pursue <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> fortunes in mainland China or Southeast Asia .
*PRO*-1 Pursuing some dream of *PRO* really making it big , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">many men</COREF> use up <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> savings , *PRO*-1 leaving <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> wives as the sole source of family support and suffering loneliness in a foreign land .
There 's no right or wrong here , and there 's no way 0 *PRO* to guarantee 0 a venture will be successful *T*-1 , but beforehand one must at least be realistic and prepare oneself psychologically for all possible outcomes , so that one wo n't suffer losses larger than one can bear *?* .
" It *EXP*-3 is indeed the case that when one is young *T*-1 , one 's quiver is full of arrows and opportunities abound , so that one can shoot at will , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> by way of analogy .
" Once you get into middle age , you 've got *PRO*-1 to make every arrow count . "
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> explains that everyone has <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">dreams</COREF> , and that *PRO* continually working toward <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">those dreams</COREF> is an excellent method of *PRO* relieving stress at any age .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Middle - aged people</COREF> have <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">heavy burdens</COREF> , and sometimes <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may feel as if <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are suffocating under <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
" But *PRO* accomplishing a lot of little changes can bring about a big change . "
If you make an effort *PRO*-2 to do what you can *?* *T*-1 , you will immediately find that your burdens have been lightened *-3 .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> cites this example : *PRO* Say 0 you hate being tied *-1 up by your work , and would like *PRO*-1 to go back to school .
Why do n't you <COREF ID="ectb_1069-part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">try</COREF> a weekend class *T*-1 ?
Maybe <COREF ID="ectb_1069-part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would help *PRO*-1 to alleviate your anxiety .
Or if you are a housewife , *PRO*-2 taking care of three generations and resentful that you ca n't go out and get the sense of accomplishment that *T*-1 comes with a full - time job , then maybe you could <COREF ID="ectb_1069-part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">work</COREF> as a volunteer in a community organization .
<COREF ID="ectb_1069-part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> would both put you into contact with other people and help you gain a sense of accomplishment .
And you can help *PRO*-1 to sweat off your middle - aged anxieties by *PRO* making a habit of *PRO* regularly exercising .
What *T*-1 's more , *PRO* do n't worry too much about time being short .
*PRO* Remember that most modern people live long lives that *T*-1 can be divided *-1 up into many stages .
In middle age , when you discover that your personal desires are coming into conflict with the demands of your family or society *T*-1 , *PRO* decide which of your problems *T*-2 are the most urgent .
*PRO* Do n't try *PRO* to accomplish all of your dreams at once .
*PRO* Maintain an unhurried frame of mind and peacefully wait for <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-004-E4" TYPE="IDENT">opportunities</COREF> to present <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-004-E4" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .

5. *PRO* Change your perspective
In middle age , one 's life is already half over , and one has already amply tasted of life 's fruits , both the bitter and the sweet .
" <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am thankful for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the bad times</COREF> , for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have given <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> more insight into life and a better opportunity *PRO* to understand <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lin Hung - kuei</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an I - kuan Tao devotee</COREF> , who *T*-2 has studied the Book of Changes and fengshui</COREF> .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">*PRO* Taking care of your parents , *PRO* losing your job , illness and *PRO* even being cheated * out of money</COREF> can be embraced *-2 as opportunities *PRO* to experience life .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are lessons that the middle - aged learn from *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to become more proficient at the art of living .
" By *PRO* changing perspective , you can understand the insignificance of your problems , " points *T*-1 out <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Chiu Chia - li</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is very important *PRO* to adjust your frame of mind .
You should n't think that there is only one way that you can be *T*-1 .
As long as you can accept yourself , then everything is all right .
As for *PRO* losing your job in middle age , some people make <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">NT$ 100,000 *U*</COREF> and <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not enough .
Other's find that NT$ 20,000 *U* is more than enough *PRO* to support the family .
The problem is that by *PRO* insisting on *PRO* making NT$ 100,000 *U* a month , you may pass by a suitable job that *T*-1 pays NT$ 20,000 *U* .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> also notes that when <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> come to forks in the road when <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> reach middle age *T*-2 *T*-1 , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may look around in all directions and feel at a loss , but <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've got *PRO*-3 to encourage <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> *PRO*-4 to keep pressing ahead .
" Even if you feel uncertain , it should be a positive feeling of uncertainty . "
At the very least , you 've got *PRO*-1 to work hard at *PRO* establishing a sense of direction .
When <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Li Liang - che</COREF> starts *-1 feeling sorry for <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *T*-2 , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> uses the age - old method of *PRO* considering those who *T*-3 are even worse off .
<COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Those people who *T*-1 are always complaining about <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lot in life</COREF> should take a walk around a cancer ward , " <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Li</COREF> says *T*-2 .
Then <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll realize how lucky <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Chiu Chia - li</COREF> , on the other hand , encourages <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the middle - aged</COREF> *PRO*-1 not to close <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> off .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> must get out and make friends , so as *PRO* to get things off <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> chests and find support from each other .
This makes it *EXP*-1 easier *PRO* to get through the bad times .
Finally , there is something that *T*-1 may seem *-1 a little cliched *ICH*-2 but is often very useful - namely the realization that things will get better , that tomorrow is another day .
" Whether you are depressed or going berserk , it *EXP*-1 's important *PRO* to remember that hormones are raging inside the bodies of <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-005-E6" TYPE="IDENT">the middle - aged</COREF> , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> .
Much like rebellious adolescents , <COREF ID="ectb_1069.part-005-E6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may merely need *-1 to pass through into another stage for the sky to become blue again .
*PRO* Do n't give up hope too early , and do n't be afraid of *PRO* asking for assistance .
When you feel at a loss emotionally *T*-1 , the experts will be able *PRO*-2 to help .
