<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can take *T*-2 home *PRO*-1 to share with <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> fellow citizens , *PRO*-1 thereby helping <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC 's</COREF> diplomatic partners</COREF> and <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> peoples to understand <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> better .

<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">The course</COREF> includes classes on political broadcasting , international broadcasting information / propaganda strategies , and digital television broadcast development , as well as visits to the Central Broadcasting Corporation , Taiwan Television Corporation , Eastern TV , and other media outlets .
*PRO* Generally speaking , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the participants</COREF> are very interested in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> high - tech industries and products .
Visits to the Kuanghua computer market have proven *-1 especially popular .
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">The visitors</COREF> are generally favorably impressed *-1 by the prosperity of Taipei City and by the consumer behavior of Taiwanese .
In a television interview , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">television news producer Marcus Bailey from Maitland TV of Grenada</COREF> said that <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has learned a great deal about the editing facilities and techniques used * in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> television</COREF> , and that <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be able *PRO*-1 to apply this information in <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own television production work when <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> returned home *T*-2 .
This experience , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *?* , has deepened <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> desire *PRO* to get further involved in television production work .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> added that <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would very much enjoy an opportunity *PRO* to work together with colleagues from <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> television</COREF> .

Unfortunately , it *EXP*-1 is very difficult for <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to apply the technical infomation 0 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> learned *T*-2 , because in most cases <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> lack the hardware and facilities available in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
Thus <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are only able *PRO*-1 to apply the theoretical insights 0 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> picked *T*-2 up to <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own media work at home .
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">Chu</COREF> says that the concrete results of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the course</COREF> will only become visible with a longer time frame .
This is just like overall relations between <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">two countries</COREF> : <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> can only be consolidated *-1 by a long period of continual exchange .
