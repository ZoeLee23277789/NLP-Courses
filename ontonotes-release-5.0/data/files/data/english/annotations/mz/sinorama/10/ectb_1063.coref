<COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">The calligrapher and seal - carver Wang Chuang - wei</COREF> spent a lifetime *PRO*-1 working assiduously at <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> craft , *PRO*-1 producing a body of work in which every single stroke and cut looks perfect *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> passed away three years ago , and this January a collection of 50 works , spanning every period of <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Wang 's</COREF> life , went on display at <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the National Palace Museum in Taipei</COREF> .
In recent years <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the museum , primarily known * for <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> collection of treasures from the palaces of Ming and Qing dynasty China</COREF> , has broadened <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> remit and begun *-1 acquiring newly excavated artifacts as well as 20th century calligraphy and painting - including works by such luminaries as Chang Ta - chien , Qi Baishi , Yu Yo - jen and Tai Ching - nung .
To those who *T*-1 knew <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">the late calligrapher and seal - carver Wang Chuang - wei</COREF> was simply " Old Chuang . "
<COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> liked a drink , as <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> friends will testify , and stories of <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> drinking exploits are still told *-1 with relish .
Visitors to <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Wang 's</COREF> home were generally greeted *-1 with something stronger than a cup of tea , and <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Wang , who *T*-2 claimed that alcohol stimulated the creative juices -LRB- *PRO* giving <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">the artist</COREF> a sense of clarity and purpose -RRB-</COREF> once penned the following couplet : *PRO* Knocking back drink makes the poetry flow / A glass or two helps you find the right phrase .

Last of the scholar - artists
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Wang 's</COREF> son Wang Ta - chih , who *T*-1 heads the history of art department at Chinese Culture University 's graduate school of history</COREF> , remembers that when <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was small *T*-2 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> really dreaded <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> dad</COREF> reciting poetry .
Oftentimes <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the elder Wang</COREF> ended up blubbering , before *PRO* wiping away <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> tears and declaring : " Great poem ! "
But <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Ta - chih</COREF> credits <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father</COREF> for *PRO* instilling in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a love of literature , and encouraging <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 to become proficient in traditional Chinese disciplines such as painting , chess , woodwind music and martial arts .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the younger Wang</COREF> : " For <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> father</COREF> was one of the last generation of Chinese scholar - artists ! "
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Chuang - wei</COREF> was born *-1 in Hebei Province in 1909 , into an educated family - <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father Wang Yi - pin</COREF> was the last xiucai scholar - official of <COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-001-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Qing dynasty</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-001-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">1644 - 1911</COREF> -RRB- .
But <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the son</COREF> had no wish *PRO* to become an official , and instead opted *PRO*-1 to spend <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> days at home , *PRO*-1 freely soaking up the atmosphere of art and culture .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> began *-1 tracing characters at age six , under <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father 's</COREF> direction , and when <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was 12 *T*-2 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> started *-3 learning how *PRO* to carve seals *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> grandfather</COREF> worked in Beijing , and every year brought back valuable calligraphic artifacts that <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had purchased *T*-1 there .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Young Wang</COREF> thus became familiar *ICH*-1 , from an early age , with the works and implements of prominent calligraphers from throughout the land .
At an age when <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">other children</COREF> were still busy at <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> games *T*-1 , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> used *-2 to bury <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> among books , for hours on end , in the family library .
Like all Chinese children , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> began by *PRO* imitating the firm and well - formed calligraphy of Yan Zhenqing .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> went on *PRO*-1 to learn the styles of many other masters of the art , *PRO*-1 progressing in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> teens to the running script and grass script of the ancient master Wang Xizhi , which *T*-2 became central to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own calligraphic style .

Love and war
At age 20 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> went to <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1063-part-002-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Beiping</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1063-part-002-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">as Beijing was then called *-1</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> *PRO*-2 to study at the Jinghua School of Art , and like many other young Chinese at that time - when the cultures of East and West were first coming into close contact *T*-3 - <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> immersed <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> in Western culture , *PRO*-4 learning all 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could *T*-5 about Western painting , sculpture , film and literature .
However , perhaps due to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> familiarity with what *T*-1 was best in Chinese art , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> did n't take this interest in Western art any further .
Instead <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> opted for the life of the true Chinese man of letters .
In 1937 , following the Marco Polo Bridge Incident , Japan occupied <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Beiping</COREF> and launched a full - scale invasion of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Newly betrothed , and with the sterling qualities of a typical northern lad , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> enlisted in the army .
For three months <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> marched with an expeditionary force to the malaria - infested jungles of Burma , and then on to India , before *PRO* making a safe return .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-002-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-002-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> young bride</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-002-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang Ming - sui</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-002-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">daughter of General Chang Jun - sheng</COREF></COREF> , was of a similarly resolute character .
*PRO*-1 Unable *PRO*-1 to get news of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wang 's</COREF> whereabouts <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> took <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> , along with <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">another young woman -LRB- who *T*-2 brought <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> baby son and was also seeking <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband -RRB-</COREF> from Jiangxi Province to <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> southwest .
*PRO*-1 Now 87 years of age , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Chang Ming - sui</COREF> says : " Many years later <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw what <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had written *T*-2 in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> diary back then .
Though <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had no news of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> whatsoever , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> guessed correctly that <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would n't wait in the rear area with the other military families , and would n't go back to <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> parents ' home either .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm still moved *-1 when <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think how well <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knew <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *T*-3 *T*-2 . "
For <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> was the kind of man who *T*-1 considered things in depth but did n't express <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> thoughts openly .

" Grown man "
After *PRO* moving to the unoccupied zone , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> began *-1 carving seals in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> spare time *PRO*-1 to support <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> .
It was at this time that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> adopted the moniker " Chuang - wei , " or " *PRO* making it as a grown man " - an ironic nod to the Han dynasty writer Yang Xiong who *T*-2 once said : " *PRO* <COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-003-E4" TYPE="IDENT">Carving</COREF> seals is boy 's work , <COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-003-E4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not for grown men *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Chuang - wei</COREF> is how <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has been known *-1 ever since *T*-2 , and to this day , few know that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> original name was Wang Yuan - feng .
According to <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsueh Ping - nan</COREF> , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of seven main disciples of the " Wang School " of seal carving</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the art</COREF> combines the skills of calligraphy , composition and carving , *PRO* requiring not only a deep familiarity with ancient forms of script but also the ability *PRO* to stretch and compress <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">characters</COREF> so as *PRO* to fit <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , neatly and cleverly , onto the compact head of a seal stone .
As an authority in the study of written characters , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> was highly knowledgeable about different styles of seal script .
The 500 or so seals of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> displayed * in the collection Yuzhao Shanfang Yinxuan show how complete <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mastery of the form was *T*-1 , from ancient guxi seals of state , to the qinyin and hanyin seals of the Qin and Han dynasties , and the styles of the oracle - bone - script and wanzhe schools .
From the horizontal and vertical strokes of hanyin script , to the snaky lines of small seal script , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> performed all with equal facility .
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh Ping - nan</COREF> recalls how <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> once watched <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> carving seals in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> study , *PRO*-1 first giving careful thought to the layout and making draft after draft on paper *T*-2 .
*PRO*-1 Having settled on a layout , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would then carve the seal in one go , *PRO*-1 using the knife with fluid ease .
Thus it was that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could fill the confined space on a seal with expansive , forceful - looking characters .
What people admired *T*-1 most about <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> was <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> ability *PRO* to wield the knife like a writing brush , *PRO* carving lines that *T*-2 seemed *-2 free and flowing .
Every stroke was <COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-003-E8" TYPE="IDENT">made</COREF> *-1 with one cut of the blade - in contrast to most seal carvers who *T*-2 need two cuts *PRO*-2 to achieve the appearance of a brush stroke .
<COREF ID="ectb_1063.part-003-E8" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was especially so of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> signature mark on the side of the seal .
Careful examination of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang 's</COREF> seals shows that the running script of the signature mark is carved *-1 with every bit as much grace and fluidity as if *PRO* done * by brush and ink , but augmented * by the hardness that *T*-3 is intrinsic to stone inscriptions .
For individuality of seal - carving style , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> ranks only behind the likes of Wu Chang - shuo and Qi Baishi
The Western artistic concepts that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> absorbed *T*-1 in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> youth opened <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mind to creative possibilities within <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the tradition</COREF> .
For example , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> introduced unconventional themes for the knobs that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> carved *T*-1 for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> seals .
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">Chang Ming - sui</COREF> picks up <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT" E_OFF="2">one tiny seal , half the length of a little finger , on which the knob is a vividly carved image of a dragon coiled * around two seashells *T*-1</COREF> .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> : " <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is one 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made *T*-2 in Chongqing .
When <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> first saw <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wondered how anyone could carve something like <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> *T*-2 . "
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> is <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> an accomplished carver of seal knobs , and <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> knows the details and dates of all <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang 's</COREF> seals and calligraphies .
*PRO* Meeting <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> one ca n't help but feel that as <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> partner and soulmate , <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> must have had a lot 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wang 's</COREF> success as an artist , and the long and happy life that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> enjoyed *T*-2 .

Something new , something old
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> passed away in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> sleep at the ripe old age of 90 , and it is said *-1 in art circles that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> died with a smile on <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> face .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> accomplishments as a calligrapher can be divided *-1 into several different phases of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life .
In Chongqing <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> came *PRO*-1 to know <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the well - known calligrapher Shen Yinmo</COREF> , and it was under <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Shen 's</COREF> direction that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> began *-3 to expand <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> repertoire beyond the styles of the 3rd to 9th centuries , *PRO* drawing on the natural elegance of noted calligraphers such as Zhao Mengfu -LRB- 1254 - 1322 -RRB- and Wen Zhengming -LRB- 1470 - 1559 -RRB- , *PRO* to develop a neat , full style , with every character a beauty *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ho Chuan - hsing</COREF> , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">deputy researcher at the calligraphy and painting department of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the National Palace Museum</COREF></COREF></COREF> , explains that the art of Chinese calligraphy can broadly be divided *-1 into two main branches : <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the nantie , or Southern style</COREF> , in which beauty of form is emphasized *-3 *T*-2 , and <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the more rugged beibei or Northern style</COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Chuang - wei</COREF> established <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> style relatively early , and up until <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> forties <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> works were characterized *-1 by the smooth , fluid forms of <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the nantie style</COREF> .
However , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Wang <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> was alert to the risk of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> calligraphy becoming over-refined , and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> began *-1 incorporating the robustness of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the beibei style</COREF> into <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> brushwork , *PRO*-1 aiming for a style that *T*-2 was more " raw and intense . "
As a result , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> calligraphy came *PRO*-1 to combine fluid grace with a core of doughty toughness .
It was a style well suited to the kind of man 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was *T*-1 : a bluff northerner with the perfectionist 's approach to art .
When <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fifties *T*-1 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> came *PRO*-2 to regard " *PRO* writing characters " as a form of painting , and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> began *-3 to innovate and experiment with the art .
For example , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> created " multiple - shadow " calligraphy , in which characters were painted *-1 in five overlapping layers *PRO* using different consistencies of ink *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> tried *PRO*-1 using deliberately crumpled paper *PRO*-2 to produce a mottled effect with the ink , and worked on a blurring effect , achieved * by *PRO* briefly dousing a freshly painted silk scroll in water .
Despite the interest generated * among calligraphers by these innovations , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> was more suited by temperament to the established forms , and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> eventually turned back to ancients for inspiration .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> studied in detail <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">the characters on the manuscripts and artifacts , dating back to the first millennium BC , that *T*-1 were at that time being unearthed *-1 at Mawangdui and other sites in mainland China</COREF> , and began *-2 absorbing <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> distinctive forms into <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own calligraphic style .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also made poems and paired - couplets out of the ancient inscriptions , *PRO*-1 pioneering a personal " something new from something old " approach .
" During this period <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> running script</COREF> was no longer as lean as <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had been *?* , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Ho Chuan - hsing</COREF> .
" <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> began *-1 slanting rightwards and spreading out a little .
Overall , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> characters became more free and unconstrained , with swooping spaces where the brush was running *PRO*-2 dry of ink *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had well and truly shaken off the earlier fixation with exquisite perfection . "
<COREF ID="218" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lin Po - ting</COREF> , <COREF ID="218" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">deputy director of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the National Palace Museum</COREF></COREF> , who *T*-1 once studied under <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> at National Taiwan Normal University , says : " <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Chuang - wei</COREF> drew on traditional styles , but not in a cliched way .
In *PRO* studying the calligraphy of ancient times <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> broke through limitations , one after another , *PRO*-1 so endowing <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> calligraphy with a simple , raw life - force . "
It was during this period that <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Wang 's</COREF> calligraphic work</COREF> reached <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> pinnacle *T*-1 .

Lifelong learner
Throughout <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> creative life <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> loved *PRO*-1 to drink , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> also loved books .

<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> , with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> vast erudition and deep knowledge of painting , calligraphy , and inscriptions , was often sought *-1 out for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> views by others in the field of art and culture .

Sometimes <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would have a dig at <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> students</COREF> , *PRO*-1 urging <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-2 to work harder in the future .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Huang Tien - tsai , who *T*-1 owns a collection of seals made * by literati down the ages</COREF> , recalls how <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> once asked <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> *PRO*-2 to re-inscribe <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">an old seal 0 <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Huang</COREF> had picked *T*-3 up on an antiques stall</COREF> *T*-4 .

Only when <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Huang</COREF> came *PRO*-1 to collect <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-2 did <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> tell <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> that <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the re-inscribed seal , which *T*-3 originally read : " *PRO* Roaming in nature makes the man , "</COREF> formerly belonged to the late - Qing reformer Kang Youwei .

*PRO* Forgetting the self
When <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> sixties *T*-1 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> began *-2 to use the style names Jianzhai -LRB- " steadily more abstinent " -RRB- and Jiansou -LRB- " steadily older " -RRB- , and carved a seal for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> with the inscription : " Steadily older and more mature , steadily more mature and more detached , steadily more detached and closer to what *T*-3 is plain and natural . "
During <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fifties <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had passed through a period of experimentation and innovation , " *PRO* being different for the sake of it , " but now <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> returned to the traditional artistic way of *PRO* " being naturally different . "
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> once said that an artistic aesthetic is something that *T*-1 emerges through long years of stylistic refinement and expression .
Every artist goes through a non-stop process of evolution , *PRO* accumulating a kind of natural grace as time goes by .
If <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">old age</COREF> enabled <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> *PRO*-1 to become " steadily more proficient " - as Buddhism would have it - at <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> art , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> also made <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> " steadily more forgetful . "
Sometimes , when *PRO* tidying up works of poetry from years before *T*-1 , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would come across one that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had no recollection of *PRO* ever writing *T*-2 .
This did n't depress <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , however .
On the contrary , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> considered it *EXP*-1 an advantage of <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">memory loss</COREF> that <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> enabled <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 to look more objectively at <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own works</COREF> , as if someone else had written <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
With this in mind <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> came up with another style name for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> : " Forgetful old man . "
Eventually <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> came *PRO*-1 to forget almost everything that *T*-2 had ever happened to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , both the sorrows and the joys .
After a lifetime dedicated * to the pursuit of art , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> at last entered that state of freedom in which " <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF> and <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> calligraphy have both attained maturity *T*-1 . "
When <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> was young *T*-1 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> once wrote the following lines on *PRO* seeing the work of an ancient master at firsthand : " Ink from the brush of a master gives one the sensation of *PRO* seeing something that *T*-3 is living and breathing , flesh and blood .
One almost feels in the presence of <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the calligrapher</COREF> , as if *PRO* meeting <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> ' face to face . ' "
