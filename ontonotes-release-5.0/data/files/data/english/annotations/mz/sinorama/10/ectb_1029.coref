The enterovirus detection biochip developed * by DR. Chip Biotechnology takes only six hours *PRO* to give hospitals the answer to whether a sample contains <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">enterovirus</COREF> , and if <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is the deadly strain Entero 71 .
Worldwide , biotechnology is a rising star of the industrial stage .
In <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , in recent years the Ministry of Economic Affairs , the National Science Council and the National Health Research Institutes have been strongly pursuing " biochip " research programs .
In the last two years , three biochip companies have also been set *-9 up in <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
Just what are <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">biochips</COREF> *T*-1 ?
What use are <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> to mankind *T*-1 ?
Why do so many people have such confidence in <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> future *T*-9 ?
What is the current state of this field in <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *T*-1 ?
And what are the prospects for future development *T*-9 ?
*PRO* Let 's take a closer look .
In just a few years ' time , or a few decades , the following scenario could become a reality :
When you 're feeling under the weather *T*-9 , all 0 you need *-2 to do *T*-1 is *PRO* buy <COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">a diagnostic biochip</COREF> from the chemist 's shop , put a drop of urine onto <COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and you will find out what *T*-3 is wrong with you - a health check will be as easy as a pregnancy test today .
<COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">Everyone</COREF> will carry with <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> <COREF ID="303" TYPE="IDENT">a biochip bearing a record and analysis of <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own DNA</COREF> .
From <COREF ID="303" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> one will not only be able *PRO*-9 to see one 's own physical condition , but even to predict what diseases one will have *T*-1 in the future .
<COREF ID="303" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> will be like an ID card , needed * when *PRO* looking for work , buying insurance or even seeking a partner for love and marriage *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="326" TYPE="IDENT">Laboratories</COREF> will no longer need all kinds of large instruments , for all stages of <COREF ID="326" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> experiments will be carried *-9 out on little biochips , *PRO* saving time , effort and money .
Today , the scenes outlined * above may just seem like <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">pipe dreams</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">these dreams</COREF> could yet <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">come</COREF> true , and the key to <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">that happening</COREF> is those little biochips .

A dream come true ?
Developments such as the sequencing of the human genome and the rapid development of genetic engineering have spawned biotechnology industries like bioinformatics , biomaterials and pharmaceutical engineering , which *T*-9 have emerged as the rising stars of 21st - century industry .
As part of the government 's efforts *PRO* to promote the biotechnology industry in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , in July 1999 <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Industrial Technology Research Institute</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">ITRI</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> set up <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Biomedical Engineering Center</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">BMEC</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> *PRO*-9 to actively develop biomedical engineering technologies .
Biochips are one of the core technologies in the field .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">BMEC</COREF> general director Dr. Johnsee Lee says that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the ITRI 's</COREF> four - year R-AMP-D program in biochip applications and technology</COREF> is now in <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> second year .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> initial objectives are mainly focused *-2 on *PRO* developing sensor chips *PRO* to screen for infectious diseases , while later goals will be *PRO* to develop technologies 0 *T*-1 to test for genetic diseases and cancers .
As well as <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">this new research establishment</COREF> , in the two years since September 1998 three commercial companies *ICH*-2 have been set *-1 up in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *PRO* to make biochips : U - Vision Biotech , Taiwan Genome Sciences and <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">DR. Chip Biotechnology</COREF> .
Of these , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">DR. Chip</COREF> attracted much attention this year when <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> developed a chip 0 *PRO* to detect enteroviruses , a deadly epidemic of which *T*-1 has gripped <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> over the last two years *T*-2 *T*-9 .

Fever chips
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">DR. Chip Bio-technology</COREF> was set *-9 up in September 1998 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Vice president Wang Shin - hwan</COREF> states that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> successfully applied to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for funding 0 *T*-2 to help <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-3 pursue a development program for enterovirus detection chips and test technology .
Today , the enterovirus chip is in the testing phase , and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">DR. Chip</COREF> is collaborating with Taipei Veterans General Hospital *PRO*-9 to obtain samples with which *PRO* to establish the accuracy of the chip *T*-1 .
What *T*-9 is so remarkable about the enterovirus detection chip when *PRO* compared * with traditional test methods *T*-1 ?
There are 68 known forms of non-polio enterovirus .
The detection chip does not simply determine whether a person is infected with enterovirus , but can also differentiate between different virus groups , *PRO* for instance showing whether a sample contains <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the deadly Entero 71 virus</COREF> , or Coxsackie A16 , which *T*-9 is easily confused *-9 with <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Entero 71</COREF> .
In addition , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the chip</COREF> and <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> accompanying PCR kit greatly reduce the time required * for testing .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Shin - hwan</COREF> notes that traditional bacterial and viral cultures take seven to ten days *PRO* to prepare , and even with the newer molecular biology testing techniques it takes three days *PRO* to get a result .
But <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">DR. Chip</COREF> has developed methods 0 *T*-3 to reduce the sample preparation time , which *T*-9 enables a result *PRO*-1 to be obtained *-1 in only six hours when *PRO* used * in combination with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> enterovirus chip *T*-2 .
Furthermore , the initial results of joint trials by <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">DR. Chip</COREF> , Chang Gung University and National Cheng Kung University suggest that the chip is over a thousand times more sensitive than traditional test methods .
" In addition to enterovirus , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> plan *PRO*-9 to develop chips 0 *T*-1 to detect other infectious diseases such as hepatitis B , hepatitis C and HIV , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Shin - hwan</COREF> .
Apart from the enterovirus chip , which *T*-9 is already at the testing stage , <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the ITRI 's Molecular Biomedical Technology Division</COREF> is also conducting research and development on biochip applications and technology .
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Research program director Pan Chao - chi</COREF> states that at present <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are actively developing a " fever chip " with a wide range of applications .
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Pan</COREF> explains that in clinical practice , the causes of fever are difficult 0 *PRO* to quickly diagnose *T*-1 .
A " fever chip " bearing the DNA of common fever - causing viruses and bacteria could be used *-1 *PRO*-1 to determine the cause of the fever and the type of pathogen involved * would be a valuable tool .
However , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Pan</COREF> points out that because of the difficulties in *PRO* substantially reducing the time needed * for sample preparation , the usefulness of <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">such a fever chip</COREF> is still limited , so that <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can not yet be widely promoted *-1 .

Where the real money is *T*-9
At present , most applications for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">biochips</COREF> are in academic research and the development of new pharmaceutical drugs .
Demand for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> is growing rapidly .
Johnsee Lee says that according to US market research estimates , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the worldwide annual consumption of microarray chips</COREF> is currently around 250,000 ; in two years <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is expected *-9 to grow to 1.2 million .
Based on a market price per chip of US$ 1,000 , the size of the world market in biochips could grow to US$ 1.2 billion *U* in 2003 , and to US$ 40 billion *U* over the next decade .
Thus <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">some people</COREF> have set <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sights on the biochip market , and believe that following <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> success in the semiconductor field , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> could go on *PRO*-1 to be a major center for contract manufacture of biochips .
Be that as it may *?* , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the small number of biochip companies so far established * in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> still find <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> market in domestic research establishments and pharmaceuticals manufacturers .
Although <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are also actively developing overseas markets , what *T*-9 interests <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> most is not <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">biochips</COREF> per se , nor are <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> content *PRO*-1 merely to be contract manufacturers .
" <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">The chips</COREF> are only a tool , and the big money is not in chip sales .
What *T*-9 counts is the R-AMP-D behind <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jerry Huang</COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">executive vice president of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">U - Vision Biotech</COREF></COREF></COREF> , reveals that <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">U - Vision , which *T*-1 was set *-1 up in September 1999</COREF> , has signed a contract with the US company Zen - Bio 0 *PRO* to jointly develop human adipocyte cDNA microarray chips *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">Huang</COREF> states that research in recent years has revealed that <COREF ID="102" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">adipocytes</COREF> <COREF ID="102" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- fat cells -RRB-</COREF> are active regulators of the energy balance in the body , and play an important role in <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">disorders such as obesity , diabetes , osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease</COREF> .
Thus it *EXP*-2 is hoped *-1 that research into human adipocytes can help in the search for drugs and other therapies 0 *T*-3 to treat <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">these disorders</COREF> .
Apart from this , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">U - Vision</COREF> is also conducting a one - year bacterial genome project , which *T*-9 aims *PRO*-9 to map the genome of a certain drug - resistant bacterium as a basis for *PRO* developing new vaccines and drugs .
Drug development
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="148" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Taiwan Genome Sciences</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="148" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">TGS</COREF> -RRB- , which *T*-9 was set *-9 up in November 1999 as a joint venture by the Uni-President Enterprises Group , Yuen Foong Yu and Tuntex Groups</COREF> , only entered the biotechnology fray in April of this year .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">CEO Andrew Kuo</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the investors</COREF> came to the view that <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> needs *-9 to develop <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> biotechnology industries , and therefore <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> combined <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> resources *PRO*-1 to make a long - term investment in the field .
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">TGS 's</COREF> strategy is *PRO* to invest in <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">a number of US genome research companies</COREF> , and to sign technology transfer agreements and chip production contracts with <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Kuo</COREF> comments that contract production of chips is merely a service activity and a source of income for <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> - <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">TGS 's</COREF> ultimate goal is in *PRO*-9 doing R-AMP-D work *PRO*-9 to identify gene sequences as targets for *PRO* developing new drugs .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Kuo</COREF> states that at present , the number of known target sequences for disease - treating drugs is only around 500 , but as the human genome is mapped *-9 out this number can be expected *-1 to increase tenfold .
Currently , <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">TGS</COREF> has <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sights set * mainly on *PRO* doing research into diseases which *T*-1 are especially prevalent in Asia , such as liver and stomach cancers .

A chip revolution
However , the potential uses for biochips go far beyond the medical applications outlined * above .
Dr. Johnsee Lee , who *T*-2 as well as *PRO* heading up <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the Biomedical Engineering Center</COREF> is also general director of Union Chemical Laboratories , a research institute under the ITRI umbrella , says that due to <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">biochips '</COREF> advantages of miniaturization , parallelism , speed and the ability *PRO* to reveal the " big picture , " <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have a very wide range of applications .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> can not only be used *-9 as a research tool in biological , medical and pharmaceutical research and development , and as a clinical diagnostic tool for *PRO* doing health checks , testing for infectious pathogens , screening blood and so on , but <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can also find uses in such areas as defense applications , police forensic work , environmental testing and food testing .
Biochips come in <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">two main types</COREF> : the microfluidics chip or " lab - on - a - chip , " and the microarray chip or " DNA chip . "
Microfluidics chips bring together biotechnology , microelectronics , micromachining and other technologies 0 *T*-9 to integrate the functions of multiple laboratory instruments onto a single chip in miniaturized form .
Meanwhile on <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">microarray chips</COREF> , biological molecules such as gene segments , oligonucleotides , proteins or antibodies are bound *-1 to the chip surface in an array of tiny spots , and a single chip may carry many tens of thousands of such spots .
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">BMEC</COREF> researcher Pan Chao - chi</COREF> uses the example of blood screening for a blood bank *PRO*-1 to illustrate the difference between <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the two kinds of chips</COREF> .
*PRO* To test <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">a blood sample</COREF> *PRO* using <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">a microarray chip</COREF> , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the sample</COREF> must first go through many preparatory steps such as purification , nucleotide extraction , copying , amplification and labeling before *PRO* being put * onto <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the chip</COREF> where the " hybridization " reaction takes place *T*-2 .
Finally , the results are analyzed *-1 *PRO* using a detection system .
Hence <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">these chips</COREF> are only suitable for use in the laboratory .
In contrast , with a lab - on - a - chip system , all the laboratory preparation stages will be done *-9 on <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the chip <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> , so that the user need only place a drop of blood directly onto <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the chip</COREF> *PRO*-1 to obtain a result .
At present , microfluidics technology is not yet mature , and no such chips have been launched *-9 as commercial products anywhere .
But , says <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Pan Chao - chih</COREF> : " This is the way 0 future biochip development will go *T*-1 . "

The poor man 's chip
Future prospects *ICH*-1 also seem *-2 infinite for microarray chips , which *T*-9 are already widely used in laboratories and research establishments .
Jerry Huang notes that DNA chips are an indispensable research tool in molecular biology .
On one little biochip , tens of thousands of gene segments can be arranged *-1 *PRO* to simultaneously detect the expression of tens of thousands of genes .
In other words , whereas in the past <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">researchers</COREF> had *-9 to investigate each gene individually , today , *PRO*-1 using biochips , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can obtain test results for tens of thousands of genes at once .
In particular , biochips not only can speed the pace of research , but can also replace laboratory animals such as rats and rabbits in many experiments , with tests being carried *-1 out directly on human genes on the chip .
Thus as research tools biochips are not only convenient and quick , but also more humane .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Dr. Konan Peck</COREF> , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an assistant research fellow at <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Academia Sinica 's Institute of Biomedical Sciences</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">IBMS</COREF> -RRB-</COREF></COREF> , says that biochips need *-9 to be made *-9 more widely available as a molecular biology research tool .
With this in mind , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Peck</COREF> has developed <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">nylon - based biochips which *T*-9 have been called " *-9 *PRO*-9 the poor man 's biochip</COREF> , " since <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> cost a third less than glass chips .
Apart from <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the material <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> being cheaper , <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the nylon chips</COREF> use a visible - spectrum colorimetric system *PRO*-2 to display results , so that <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can be read *-9 *PRO* using an ordinary optical scanner , which *T*-1 costs 50 - 70 % less than *PRO* using a special laser detector .
The nylon membrane biochips currently produced * by TGS and U - Vision Biotech are all derived *-9 from the technology developed * by <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Konan Peck</COREF> .
Cutting edge
Can <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> really repeat <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> success in the semiconductor industry , *PRO*-9 to become a major production center for biochips ?
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">BMEC</COREF> director Johnsee Lee</COREF> observes that the level of scientific and technical know - how required * for biochip production is very high , so that the opportunities for contract manufacture are limited *-9 .
However , due to <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> early entry into biochip research and development , and the high state of development of <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> semiconductor industry , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> is well supplied with relevant technology and skills .
Thus , says <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> , " <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> should have opportunities *PRO* to enter this field not merely as a contract manufacturer . "
The potential and importance of biochips is plain 0 *PRO* to see *T*-2 , but in this new , interdisciplinary industry , there are still many obstacles and difficulties 0 *PRO* to overcome *T*-1 .
Apart from the fact that the technology is not yet mature , and that generally accepted , mutually compatible international standards have not yet emerged , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the biggest bottleneck for biochips at the moment</COREF> is the many thousands of patents which *T*-1 have been taken *-1 out in the field , which *T*-2 limit the avenues available to each player .
" Because this area is a patents minefield , it *EXP*-1 's impossible *PRO* to create a product which *T*-2 from start to finish does n't infringe on anyone else 's patents , " says *T*-3 <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Johnsee Lee</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> view , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">this problem</COREF> may be resolved *-9 in the future by the exchange of patented technologies between players .
In other words , at this stage companies must actively carry out research and development , and obtain international patents , in order *PRO* to have bargaining chips in future negotiations .
At present , <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">the BMEC</COREF> has over 10 patents pending in the areas of microfluidics biochips , chip surface processing technology and probe design and applications .

*PRO* Pushing the envelope
Although at <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> present stage of development , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">biochips</COREF> are already a great help to researchers , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are still far removed from ordinary people 's lives .
But one day <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will play an important role in all our lives .
" Applications and commercialization are our goal , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Johnsee Lee</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says that only if research results are commercialized *-1 does research produce an economic payback .
Equally , *PRO* to have a really broad market biochips need *-1 to go beyond the laboratory researcher , and into hospitals , clinics and homes , and to individual users .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> points out that before biochips will be worth *PRO* commercializing , sample preparation needs *-9 to be made *-9 convenient , reading results must be simple and easy , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the chips '</COREF> speed and accuracy must be high , and <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cost must be low .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> predicts that in one to two years , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">biochips</COREF> will be suitable for use in supplemental tests , and after around three years for high - throughput screening ; in five years time it *EXP*-3 should be possible *PRO* to develop <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> into general screening tools which *T*-9 will be as easy 0 *PRO* to use *T*-4 as the pregnancy test kits on the market today .
IBMS associate research fellow Konan Peck agrees that in the foreseeable future , diagnostic chips will enable <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">everyone</COREF> *PRO*-1 to learn <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> current state of health and know what diseases <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may develop *T*-9 in the future .
But in a situation where testing technology is ahead of medical treatment technology *T*-9 , the medical problems so discovered * may not be treatable .
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Mankind</COREF> is always challenging <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> limits , and when , in the near future , biochips lift the veil of many diseases *T*-1 , the next challenge will have only just begun .
