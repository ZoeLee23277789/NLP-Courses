Genteel Journalis --
<COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">Thomas Lu</COREF>
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. * by Robert Taylor -RRB-
<COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">Thomas Lu</COREF> is the doyen of the Chinese news media .
*PRO*-1 Still out on the journalistic front lines at 81 , <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">this spry , forthright veteran</COREF> has an immense zest for life .
At 78 , *PRO*-1 drawing on <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> astonishingly sharp memory , <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> completed <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> reminiscences and " record of emotional regrets . "
<COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is not only one of the " wonders " of Taiwan 's journalistic world , but is also recognized *-9 by those of <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> generation as a gentleman and a " good - looking man . "
<COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">A person 's</COREF> looks change with <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> age and <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> state of mind .
Many friends have told <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> look better the older <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> get *T*-1 .
People do n't know that when <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was young *T*-9 <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had dreadful protruding teeth , but now not only do <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> teeth no longer show , but the lines of <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> face have also softened .

People who *T*-9 know <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> know that there have always been two great loves in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> life : the news , and women .
Now that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> 80s , *PRO*-9 looking back <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can say 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've done alright in both respects , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've learnt that both *PRO* reporting the news well , and finding favor with women , depend on your character and conduct .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Journalism</COREF> is not just a profession , but should also be a vocation - you have *-9 to throw yourself fully into <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">this infinitely broad field of endeavor</COREF> .
Intellectually and spiritually , in work and in love , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have gained experience and fulfilment .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have always remembered the encouragement which <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Yu Youren</COREF> gave <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *T*-9 as a young reporter .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said that *PRO* to be a fearless champion of social justice , as *PRO* is expected * of a journalist , the most important thing , apart from energy and vitality , is modesty .
You have *-9 to treat everybody the same , and not be overawed *-9 by the great and powerful .
A president or a street sweeper deserve the same respect as a human being , and should both be treated *-9 the same way .
Funnily enough , an unassuming attitude is also advantageous in relations with the opposite sex .
Chinese society <COREF ID="ectb_1019-part-001-E4" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> male dominated , and women are mostly regarded *-1 as *PRO* having a subsidiary role .
In <COREF ID="ectb_1019-part-001-E4" TYPE="IDENT">this kind of unfair situation</COREF> , an upstanding man should cherish and respect women all the more .
A considerate attitude can be expressed *-9 in little things .
For instance , when you see that <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">a hair</COREF> has fallen onto <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">a female friend 's</COREF> shoulder *T*-9 , you should lightly pick <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> off for <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> , and throw <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> away or put <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in your pocket .
If sincere , this kind of action is attractive in a man .
If <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">a woman</COREF> expresses <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> liking for you , then no matter whether <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is pretty , or whether you find <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> attractive , you should respond in the same way , and with the same respect .
When <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was a young reporter stationed * in Europe *T*-9 , there was <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">a British woman reporter who *T*-1 liked <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> very much</COREF> .
Once <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was driving <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> somewhere *PRO* to report a story when we had an accident , and <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> suffered some badly broken bones *T*-1 .
Although <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was n't attracted *-9 to <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> in that way , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1019-part-001-E9" TYPE="IDENT">went</COREF> *PRO*-1 to see <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> every day in hospital , and <COREF ID="ectb_1019-part-001-E9" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> left a deep impression *ICH*-3 on <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> of how considerate Chinese men can be *T*-2 .
*PRO*-9 Looking back at <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> life , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1019-part-001-E12" TYPE="IDENT">'ve</COREF> hardly had any really bad experiences in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> relationships with women , and <COREF ID="ectb_1019-part-001-E12" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is because just as in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> professional life , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've always maintained a self - critical attitude towards <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> emotions , and always tried *PRO*-1 to prevent <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF> acting like a male chauvinist .

Looks are something 0 you are born *-1 with *T*-9 , but <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">character</COREF> is something 0 you can work on *T*-2 , and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can outweigh your appearance .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Luo Jialun</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the leading lights of the May Fourth Movement</COREF></COREF> , is a famous example .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Luo</COREF> was not good looking , and was even ridiculed *-9 as " *PRO* looking like a cross between a pig , a dog and a bear . "
But <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was tremendously well - read , had a beautiful writing style , and for a time <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was Chinese ambassador to India .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> wife was a universally admired beauty , the envy of all .
So <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> say , " handsome is as handsome does *?* . "
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was imprisoned *-9 by both the Kuomintang and the Communists , and at times <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> might have been killed *-1 .
Perhaps other people in the same situation might have wallowed in self - pity , but <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw it as a rare opportunity in life .
In 1951 , in a dark prison cell during a big Communist purge , what *T*-9 came into <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> mind was not fear of death .
Instead , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wondered what kind of headline <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> death would merit *T*-1 in the newspapers .
" 10,000 Rush *PRO*-9 to See <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Lu</COREF> Executed *-1 " ?
Perhaps it was this eternal optimism which *T*-9 changed <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> frame of mind and <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> appearance .
This is the advice 0 <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd like *PRO*-2 to give young people *T*-9 :
it *EXP*-3 's true that good looks can come from external grooming , *PRO* wearing nice clothes , or *PRO* wearing earrings ; and perhaps you can get other people 's attention by *PRO* creating your own special look .
But *PRO* do n't overdo it .
It is appropriate dress , and a temperament developed * through study and practice , which *T*-1 really make a man attractive .
