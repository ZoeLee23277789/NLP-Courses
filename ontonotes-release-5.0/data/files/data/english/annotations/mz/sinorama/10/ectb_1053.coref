Asian Values vs. Children 's Rights
-LRB- Chang Chiung - fang / photos by Pu Hua - chih / tr. * by Christopher MacDonald -RRB-
<COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">A schoolchild</COREF> writes : " When <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> grow up *T*-1 <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-2 to be a clown " in <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> exercise book .
If <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> teacher is Chinese , <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the probable response</COREF> is : " No ambition !
Hardly worth *PRO* teaching *?* ! "
But with a Western teacher , <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's more likely * to be : " *PRO* Go on and fill the world with laughter ! "
In Chinese society it *EXP*-1 has been traditional *PRO* to place demands on <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">children</COREF> rather than give <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> encouragement , and the idea of what *T*-2 constitutes " success " has been fairly narrowly defined *-3 .
Yet Chinese / Asian values have been much extolled *-1 in the West in the past few years .
Is the concept of children 's rights , and human rights as a whole , really incompatible with so - called " Asian values " ?
As members of the global village in the 21st century , what route should we *T*-1 follow *T*-2 ?
It was <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">former Singapore premier Lee Kuan Yew</COREF> who *T*-1 first raised the banner of " Asian Values . "
In 1992 <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> said in an interview : " For East Asian countries like Japan , Korea , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore , group values and behavior have been extremely helpful in the process of *PRO* ' catching up ' economically .
East Asian values , such as the need *PRO* to sacrifice individual interests in pursuit of the group interest , have been a major impetus for the region 's rapid development . "

Group society
According to one survey , Asians are more likely *ICH*-1 than Americans *PRO* to regard such things as " close family relations , " " an orderly society , " " respect for knowledge " and " *PRO* maintaining group harmony " as important values .
At the United Nations World Human Rights Convention , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> delegate responded to the West 's frequent criticisms of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> human rights record in the following terms : " The concept of human rights is a legacy of historical development , and is connected with <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">a country 's</COREF> specific social and economic situation , as well as <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> history , culture and values .
There are different human rights requirements at different stages of historical development .
Countries at different phases of development , or with different historical traditions and cultural background , understand *RNR*-1 and deal with *RNR*-1 human rights in different ways , so <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the human rights standards of one country</COREF> can not be uniformly applied *-2 around the world , in the expectation that other countries will act in line with <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">those standards</COREF> .

From obligations to rights
From the viewpoint of East Asian societies , the West <COREF ID="ectb_1053-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">tends</COREF> *-1 to over-emphasize freedom and individual rights , and <COREF ID="ectb_1053-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> leads to serious problems .
But from the modern perspective , the traditional values of East Asia are even less palatable .
In the traditional feudal society of China , the head of the family exercised unquestioned authority .
Under the precepts of filial piety , children had neither free will nor the right *PRO* to be independent entities .
One of the tales in <COREF ID="ectb_1053.part-002-E12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Yuan dynasty work</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1053.part-002-E12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">24 Paragons of Filial Piety</COREF> records that in ancient times <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">a man named * *PRO* Guo Ju , who *T*-2 was too poor 0 *T*-1 to keep <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother</COREF> *PRO*-3 properly fed</COREF> , proposed to <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife that <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1053-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">kill</COREF> <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> three - year - old son</COREF> - since <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was consuming a share of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the old lady 's</COREF> food .
<COREF ID="ectb_1053-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> duly did *T*-1 , *PRO*-2 digging a pit and burying <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the boy</COREF> *PRO*-3 alive .
The legal code of <COREF ID="ectb_1053.part-002-E13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Qing dynasty</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1053.part-002-E13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">1644 - 1911</COREF> -RRB- stated that where <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">parents</COREF> brought charges against <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> offspring</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the accused</COREF> were automatically considered *-2 guilty and there was no need for a formal trial .
And for most of the past millennium , Chinese criminal law provided that unfililal conduct - such as *PRO* hitting or cursing a parent - could be accepted *-1 as just cause in the cases of <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">parents who *T*-2 murdered <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> offspring</COREF> .
Those old - time filial paragons and legal codes are wildly at odds with today 's notions of children 's rights , and basic human rights as a whole .
According to <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="111" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tang Mei - ying</COREF> , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a professor of primary education at Taipei Municipal Teachers College</COREF></COREF> , Confucian thought does include emphasis on human rights , such as the expectation that fathers should be " compassionate , " sons " filially pious , " a monarch " benevolent " and his ministers " loyal . "
What it does n't do *T*-1 is *PRO* propose ways of *PRO* dealing with a father who *T*-2 is not compassionate and a monarch who *T*-3 is not benevolent .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Tang</COREF> feels that Confucian thought basically stresses obligations , but that in modern society the idea of obligations is no longer a straightforward matter : when <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">person A</COREF> neglects *PRO*-3 to fulfil <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> obligations *T*-1 , <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">person B</COREF> can be said *-2 to have been deprived *-2 of <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> rights .
But when we start out from the notion of <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">rights</COREF> , and support <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">those rights</COREF> with legal guarantees *T*-1 , we find 0 it *EXP*-3 is better *ICH*-2 *PRO* to have guaranteed rights than *PRO* to depend on <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">everyone</COREF> fulfilling <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> obligations .

The best of both worlds
Neighboring places heavily influenced * by " Asian values , " such as Japan , Korea and Hong Kong , have <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">a strong sense of how important it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 *PRO* to belong to " the educated class , " just as we do *?* here</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Tang Mei - ying</COREF> points *?* out , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> means that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">parents</COREF> expect <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children to perform outstandingly well at school .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">The importance that parents attach *T*-1 to education</COREF> is of course a strong point for Taiwan , but one drawback of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is that <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">parents</COREF> often set <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> expectations too high .
At an age when most kids in the West are still playing every day *T*-1 , our children have already started *-2 shuttling about among supplementary schools for classes in English , computers , abacus and art .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Tang</COREF> explains that although <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Western children</COREF> seem *-1 to be playing about , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are also finding out what *T*-2 interests <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , and <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have plenty of chances *PRO* to change direction .
Here , however , the education system gives <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">children</COREF> hardly any opportunity for *PRO* making choices , and education is foisted *-1 on <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> rather than *PRO* being something 0 <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> seek *T*-2 for <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Tang</COREF> : " <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">A lot of people these days</COREF> hide <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> at graduate school , *PRO* partly to put off *PRO* confronting reality and partly to continue * meeting <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> parents ' expectations .
Nowadays we even have cram schools for graduate school students . "
However , the Western educational model , in which <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">children</COREF> are shown *-1 respect and allowed *PRO*-1 to decide and choose for <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> *T*-2 , is not without drawbacks .
<COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">One American - who *T*-1 was pushing forty by the time 0 <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> earned <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> PhD *T*-2</COREF> - says that when <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was younger *T*-3 , whenever <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had an important choice 0 *PRO* to make *T*-4 about <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> future and asked <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> parents</COREF> for <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> opinion *T*-6 , the response was : " <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll respect and support <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> no matter what <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> decide *T*-5 ! "
Now <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> feels that <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has squandered a lot of time because of vacillation and a lack of clear guidance .

Modern parents at a loss
With today 's mingling of Eastern and Western values , and modern and traditional concepts , it *EXP*-1 is no wonder that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">parents</COREF> find <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> at a bit of a loss .
The difficulty is that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ca n't simply dismiss deeply ingrained traditional notions , but at the same time <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need *-1 to adapt to the values of the modern age .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">The intellectual understanding</COREF> is there but <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has n't yet been fully internalized *-1 , and this accounts for <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the gap that *T*-2 can often be seen *-2 between understanding and behavior</COREF> .
An inkling of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> can be seen *-1 in the results of a recent online ballot conducted * by <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the Hsin Yi Foundation</COREF> , asking <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">parents</COREF> about <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> " educational approach or concepts . "
The runaway leader , with 21 % of votes , was the approach summed * up in the sentence : " I praise my children with phrases like ' that 's great ! ' and ' good boy / girl ! ' "
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang Sing - ju</COREF> , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">executive director of <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the Hsin Yi Foundation</COREF></COREF></COREF> , points out that modern parents <COREF ID="ectb_1053-part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">know</COREF> how important it *EXP*-1 is *T*-2 *PRO* to give children encouragement , and <COREF ID="ectb_1053-part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> shows 0 there has been a lot of progress .
But there are still pitfalls 0 *PRO* to watch out for *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> says that many parents <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">use</COREF> praise without *PRO* making it *EXP*-3 clear to <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the child</COREF> just what <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is being praised *-2 for *T*-1 , and <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> " cheats " <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the child</COREF> rather than *PRO* showing <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> true respect .

It 's the process that *T*-1 counts
A child who *T*-1 is <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">treated</COREF> *-1 with respect wo n't stop *-2 studying on account of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">a child who *T*-1 is free *PRO*-1 to make <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own choices</COREF> does n't automatically turn into a delinquent .
Experimental classes giving <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">pupils</COREF> the chance for self - motivated study are now being offered *-1 in some schools in Taiwan , and the results show that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">these children</COREF> are happier and more positive .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Joyce Yen Feng</COREF> , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">executive director of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Child Welfare League Foundation</COREF> , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an organization dedicated * to *PRO* promoting the rights of children</COREF></COREF> , says that there does n't have *-1 to be a contradiction between *PRO* granting <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">children</COREF> <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rights and *PRO* maintaining Asian values .
In the past , too much emphasis on schoolwork and good grades encouraged the development of a society in which many are crudely obsessed *-1 with personal gain *T*-2 .
*PRO* Stressing children 's rights is one way 0 *PRO* to change that mentality *T*-1 , and there is basically nothing un-Asian about *PRO* using respect and enlightenment *PRO*-2 to pursue the very best outcome .
In other words , we need *-1 to draw on the strengths of both Eastern and Western culture , *PRO*-1 to show that Asian values are also global values .
East or the West , we 're all human and we share the same values , and this applies equally to the rights of children .
p. 22
In this transitional era , caught * between East and West , traditional and modern , parents have *-1 to be ready *PRO*-1 to respond to new challenges all the time .
