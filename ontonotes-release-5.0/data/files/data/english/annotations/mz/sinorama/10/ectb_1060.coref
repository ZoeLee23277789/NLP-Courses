* Mourn for the End of an Era : Three Taiwanese Cultural Giants
-LRB- Laura Li / tr. * by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">The year 2001</COREF> has started with a series of saddening losses in the cultural realm .
On the first of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF> , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="99" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsu Tsang-houei</COREF> , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the dean of Taiwanese music</COREF></COREF> , passed away after a fall left <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in a coma .
Then came the news that <COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang Kwang-chih</COREF> , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the respected archeologist and former vice-president of the Academia Sinica</COREF> , had died of illness in the United States .
Finally , on the afternoon of January 9 , the historian Tai Kuo-hui died of septicemia .
<COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">These three masters in <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> fields</COREF> were all in <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> early seventies .
Since <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had just reached a time in <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives and careers where <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could slow down and enjoy the fruits of <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> past labors *T*-1 , one feels inclined *-2 to complain to heaven or sigh about the brevity of life .
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Each of <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">these men</COREF></COREF> was at the forefront of <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> field in Taiwan , and <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> deaths represent the end of an era .

Where should Chinese music go *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu Tsang-houei</COREF> had a huge impact on Taiwanese music over the last half century .
*-1 Born * in Homei , Changhua in 1928 , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> studied the violin in Japan as a youth .
Later , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> studied in France *ICH*-1 for five years , where <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> became well versed in the various schools of modern Western music *T*-3 .
In 1959 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> returned *-1 to introduce modern Western classical music to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> homeland .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also published a seminal essay entitled * , " Where Should Chinese Music Go *T*-1 ? " in which <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> passionately urged <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fellow musicians *-2 to create contemporary Chinese music *T*-3 .
Many young composers took up <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> call and wrote difficult and dissonant twelve - tone works that *T*-1 would become the creative mainstream in music departments .
Unfortunately , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">schools of modern classical music</COREF> struggled *-1 to hold <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> audiences even in the West , and audiences found it harder and harder 0 *T*-2 to connect with <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT" E_OFF="2">the Taiwanese modern music of which <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> was the leading figure *T*-3</COREF> .
Opinion has remained polarized about the worth of <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">this music</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> was also at the forefront of efforts 0 * to record traditional Taiwanese folk music *T*-1 .
In the mid-1960s , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> , Shih Wei-liang , Lu Ping-chuan and others established various organizations , including the Folk Music Research Workshop .
*-1 Fighting the reigning bias in favor of musical traditions from the mainland , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> led the way in * collecting and recording Taiwanese Nanguan music and Hakka eight - tone , as well as the music of the aboriginal tribes .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">These collections</COREF> helped *-1 to delineate the history of Taiwanese music .
In the past decade , with the rise of the " Taiwan first " movement in politics , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu 's</COREF> folk music collections</COREF> have garnered more and more attention , and CDs of <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> have been released *-1 one after another .
In the last few years , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> was appointed *-1 both as national policy advisor to the president and as the chairman of the National Culture and Arts Foundation .

Cross-strait archeological star
Just as <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu 's</COREF> work spanned from the classical to the contemporary , from the West to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> native soil , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the archaeologist Chang Kwang-chih 's</COREF> broad vision allowed <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to build the foundations for the field of archeology both for <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and China as a whole .
In <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> autobiography , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> describes <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> as a " Yam Man , " which *T*-1 is an allusion to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> being shaped *-2 like a yam .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> explains that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was actually born *-1 in Beijing , though <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father 's family was indeed from <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
After <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was returned *-1 to Chinese rule , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> returned to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the land of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> roots</COREF> .
*-1 Studying at Chienkuo High in 1949 , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was arrested *-1 on false charges of * having participated in the April 6 Incident .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> spent nearly a year in jail before * taking the high school equivalency exam and going on * to study archeology at NTU .
After * earning <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> doctorate at Harvard , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took an academic post in America but always maintained <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> focus on Chinese archeology .
Largely due to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> unflagging efforts , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese archeology</COREF> attained a sturdy theoretical and practical foundation that *T*-1 enabled <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to emerge as a world-class discipline .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> research <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">showed</COREF> that the rise of <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese civilization</COREF> did not occur exclusively in the area around the Yellow River Valley .
Rather <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> emerged from several languages , ethnic groups and cultures spread * over a vast landscape .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> overturned the " single origin theory " and debunked Western assumptions about " oriental despotism . "
Though a world-class scholar , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> never forgot <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the land of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> origins</COREF> .
In the 1960s , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> returned to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and embarked on research at the Fengpitou site in Kaohsiung , * completing the most extensive archeological study made * in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> in over a century .
Then <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went on *-1 to <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">perform</COREF> research in an area that *T*-2 spanned the Choshui and Tatu river valleys .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a huge undertaking that *T*-1 involved both archeology and geology .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Many of the leading lights among the younger generation of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> anthropologists</COREF> cut <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> research teeth on <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">this project</COREF> .
Unfortunately , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Chang Kwang-chih</COREF> became afflicted with Parkinson 's disease more than a decade ago .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> limbs started *-1 to shake , and it *EXP*-2 became impossible for <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to perform fieldwork .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> deeply regretted that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was unable * to examine the Shangqiu site in eastern Henan .
Though sick , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> returned home at the end of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life *-1 to serve as vice president of the Academia Sinica , where <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> worked hard *-3 to establish <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> as the preeminent world center for sinology *T*-2 .

Taiwanese heart , Chinese sentiments
Finally there was the death of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the historian Tai Kuo-hui , who *T*-1 served on the National Security Council and was admired *-1 as much for <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> lofty character as for <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> pioneering work in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese history</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> differences of opinion with <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Teng-hui</COREF> had thrust <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> into the spotlight in recent years .
*-1 Born * in 1931 in Taoyuan , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Tai</COREF> was educated *-1 under <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese colonial rule</COREF> , and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> earned a doctorate in agriculture at Tokyo .
Back in the 1960s , when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese history</COREF> was still a taboo subject in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Tai</COREF> organized a research society *ICH*-2 in Japan devoted * to the study of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese history</COREF> and other related Asian topics .
For this work , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was blacklisted *-1 in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
Later , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Tai</COREF> repeatedly declined invitations *ICH*-1 from <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Chiang Ching-kuo</COREF> * to return .
It was n't until <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Teng-hui</COREF> was president that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> finally came home *T*-1 .
But when <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did *T*-1 , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> different perspective about <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> history</COREF> brought <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Tai Kuo-hui</COREF> farther and farther from the mainstream of the ruling party .
Although <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Tai</COREF> did n't flinch from * condemning the authoritarianism of <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Chiang Kai-shek</COREF> and <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son</COREF> <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chiang Ching-kuo</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> also had harsh things 0 * to say *T*-1 about <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese colonial rule</COREF> - unlike <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Teng-hui , who *T*-2 had fond memories of the colonial era</COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Tai , who *T*-1 described <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> as an " independent-minded Chinese born * in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> , " never lost <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> affection for <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">China proper</COREF> , and these sentiments set <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> apart from most historians of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
With regard to cross-strait relations , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Tai</COREF> made <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> famous " testicles analogy</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is a part of China , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> stated *?* , just as testicles are a part of a man 's body .
Though *-1 inextricably linked *-1 to the body , <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the testicles</COREF> have <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own special functions .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> based <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> analogy</COREF> on what <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> deemed *T*-1 was best for all of the Chinese people .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> theory was a far cry from <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Teng-hui 's</COREF> belief that <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> should establish clear boundaries between <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> and <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Tai Kuo-hui</COREF> never shied from controversy .
Otherwise , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would not have chosen *-1 to study <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese history</COREF> * to begin with .
Throughout <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> maintained <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> tough Hakka spirit and academic independence , *-1 holding fast to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> opinions and never compromising .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was greatly admired *-1 for <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> intellectual integrity .
<COREF ID="ectb_1060.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">These great masters '</COREF> deaths</COREF> have come at a time when the field of education has been in the spotlight for other reasons *T*-1 .
The Ministry of Education has just formally <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">apologized</COREF> - 50 years after the fact - for the April 6 Incident , and a university president has been <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">found</COREF> *-1 guilty of * plagiarizing a research paper .
<COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">The former</COREF> shows that <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">intellectuals in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> need no longer fear torture and imprisonment for <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> beliefs .
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">The latter</COREF> suggests that some people have allowed blind ambition to sully the pure ideal of scholarship .
Apart from * causing us to mourn , <COREF ID="ectb_1060.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the deaths of <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">these great men</COREF></COREF> have left us with a lot 0 * to think about *T*-1 .
