<COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Bands</COREF> Make <COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> Mark
-LRB- Eric Lin / tr. * by David Mayer -RRB-
The band tradition in <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> dates back to the time when the US military forces had bases on <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> *T*-9 .
It *EXP*-2 was de rigueur *PRO* to have a live band at all the bars frequented * by American soldiers .
<COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="167" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Veteran radio program host</COREF> <COREF ID="167" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tao Hsiao - ching</COREF></COREF> recalls that when <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to organize a concert in <COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the 1960s</COREF> *T*-9 , there were already a lot of bands 0 *PRO* to choose from *T*-2 .
Apart from bands that *T*-1 worked the bars , there were others that *T*-9 went into the pop music scene .
One example was " <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="190" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Five Flower Petals</COREF> , " <COREF ID="190" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a five - girl band</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Lead singer Tsai Mi - mi</COREF> had a very sweet voice -LRB- " Mama ! Mama ! *PRO* Give me a guitar . . . . " -RRB- , and <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was nice looking too .
But <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">the Flower Petals</COREF> were n't so much a band as a collection of teen idols .
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">A number of bands</COREF> *ICH*-1 appeared in <COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the 1960s</COREF> that *T*-2 sang mostly Western songs .
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> lead singers sometimes got noticed *-1 by music companies and became famous singers .
The most famous ones were Huang Ying - ying , Julie Su , Kao Ling - feng , and Billy .
<COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">Campus bands across <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF></COREF> began *-9 writing <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own music and lyrics in the 1970s .
Notable examples include The Travelers and Wood Guitar .
<COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">These bands</COREF> , and the folk music 0 <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> sang *T*-9 , reigned supreme on into <COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the 1980s</COREF> until the sudden rise of a number of extremely popular rock bands .
Some of the more notable <COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">1980s</COREF> rock bands were The Chiu Chiu 's , The Red Ants , and several bands featuring Hsueh Yueh .
*PRO*-9 Looking back on the origins of <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">band music</COREF> , <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">Tao Hsiao - ching</COREF> attributes <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> popularity to the albums of Lo Ta - yu and the fact that many proprietors of pubs and other establishments that *T*-2 hire live music started *-1 putting emphasis on " the band sound . "
The social commentary in the lyrics of these songs also elicited a strong response .

According to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wang Tsu - shou</COREF> , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a senior reporter at Minsheng Daily</COREF> , " Youth bands were so popular , we thought for a while that we had entered into a sort of ' <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Age of the Band</COREF> , ' but <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> turned out *-9 to be short - lived . "
The high tide of band music spurred the formation of many student bands , and KHS Musical Company used *-9 to organize an annual campus rock band competition where <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">many singers and bands</COREF> *ICH*-2 got <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> first big break , including <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Chang Yu - sheng</COREF> , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Tai Cheng - hsiao</COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The Orient Express</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The latter</COREF> , which *T*-1 was composed *-1 entirely of good - looking guys , was the only group that *T*-2 released an album together after *PRO* going professional , however , while <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> and <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Tai</COREF></COREF> opted *PRO*-9 to strike out on <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own as solo artists .
As Tao Hsiao - ching explains , band music only appealed to a limited market , and it *EXP*-1 was very expensive *PRO* to keep a band *PRO*-2 operating .
For these reasons , music companies preferred *PRO*-9 to <COREF ID="ectb_1041-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">sign</COREF> up only the lead singers .
<COREF ID="ectb_1041-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> remained the prevailing pattern in the industry from Kao Ling - feng 's time through the appearance of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Chang Yu - sheng</COREF> .
Then China , <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Harlem Yu</COREF> -AMP- <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Ding Jian Pai Dang</COREF></COREF> , Baboo , and <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Bai</COREF> and <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> band all released <COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-001-E3" TYPE="IDENT">albums</COREF> in 1992 .
The music world was electrified *-2 , and people began *-1 talking once again about the arrival of " <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the Age of the Band</COREF> , " but the market for this music was still weak .
<COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-001-E4" TYPE="IDENT">The only one of <COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-001-E3" TYPE="IDENT">these albums</COREF> that *T*-9 became a big hit</COREF> was <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Harlem Yu</COREF> -AMP- <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Ding Jian Pai Dang</COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-001-E4" TYPE="IDENT">this album 's</COREF> strong sales were due in large part to the fame of <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-001-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the singer</COREF> , <COREF ID="ectb_1041.part-001-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Harlem Yu</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Bai</COREF> , in the meantime , held fast to <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> rock style and struggled into the mid-90s .
Then , *PRO*-2 playing to small pub audiences , <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> finally hooked up with <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">a band called * *PRO* China Blue</COREF> and rocketed to immense popularity as locally rooted Taiwanese culture began *-1 to take on a certain cachet .
The success of <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Bai</COREF> -AMP- <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">China Blue</COREF> has rested primarily , however , on <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Wu 's</COREF> reputation as a singer and songwriter , while <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the band</COREF> has played more of a supporting role .
Amidst this rebirth of youth bands in the 1990s , there has been a very interesting undercurrent .
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Groupie , LTK Commune , and a raft of other underground bands</COREF> have quietly been carving out a niche for <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> in the pub scene .
Both mainstream and non-mainstream music companies -LRB- such as Friendly Dog and Crystal Records , respectively -RRB- have begun *-9 to release <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> albums , *PRO*-9 thus giving a small number of enthusiasts ample opportunity *PRO* to keep *PRO* up to date with the unde
