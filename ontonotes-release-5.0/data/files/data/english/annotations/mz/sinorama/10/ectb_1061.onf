Plain sentence:
---------------
    In announcing the ruling, Judicial Yuan Secretary-General Yang Jen-shou explained that the Executive Yuan's decision to
    suspend construction of the nuclear plant was a major change in government policy, and since the premier is required to
    deliver a report to the legislature in such cases, Premier Chang's failure to do so represents a procedural flaw.

Plain sentence:
---------------
    The various opposition caucuses in the legislature issued a joint statement arguing that in describing the decision to
    suspend construction of the plant as " procedurally flawed, " the Grand Justices had in effect declared the Cabinet's
    unilateral action illegal, and the Cabinet's action has naturally lost legal validity for that reason.

    According to National Chengchi University law professor and constitutional expert Su Yeong-chin, who headed the legal
    team presenting the Legislative Yuan's arguments to the Council of Grand Justices in this case, the crux of the nuclear
    plant dispute is about the use of democratic means in arriving at policy decisions, and should not be seen as an
    argument for or against nuclear power.
