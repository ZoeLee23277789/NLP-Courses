Last year , nearly one million travelers from <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> passed through <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> Airport</COREF> , *PRO*-1 heading for mainland China or visiting <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> , and accounting for 80 % of passengers using <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the airport</COREF> .
Around 1,000 of <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> civil servants have studied in <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and every year some 30,000 people travel from <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> to <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> for business or work , along with more than 400 students .
But against the backdrop of continued proclamations from <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> about how " <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> ' one country two systems ' arrangement sets an example for *PRO* solving <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> problem</COREF> *T*-3 , " <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">these figures</COREF> , along with <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> - <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> exchanges</COREF> that <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> represent *T*-1 , have been willfully neglected *-2 by <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> mainstream media .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> and <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> : so near and yet so far .
What are *T*-1 the connections that *T*-2 bind <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">these two places</COREF> , and what are *T*-3 the opportunities for new developments in the wake of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the 1999 handover</COREF> ?
On <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">December 19 , 1999</COREF> , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the eve of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> transfer of sovereignty</COREF></COREF> , the China Times in <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> published <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">a survey on <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwanese public 's</COREF> views about <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> return to Chinese control</COREF></COREF> .
According to <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the survey</COREF> , 31 % of <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">people in <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> were n't even aware that <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> was about *-1 to be handed *-1 back to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> , while <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">53 %</COREF> answered that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't know whether <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the handover</COREF> would be beneficial or harmful for <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> development .
But when *PRO* asked * whether <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the " one country two systems " formula</COREF> , as *PRO* used * for Hong Kong and <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> , was acceptable for <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *T*-2 , 59 % responded " No , " while <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">27 %</COREF> said that <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't know .
As these results clearly indicate , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> still know little about <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> , in spite of <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">existing exchanges</COREF> , and more than half of <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> flatly reject <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing 's</COREF> " one country two systems " formula</COREF> - so readily taken * up in <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> - as a solution to <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> question</COREF> .

Conveniently connected
It *EXP*-1 takes just an hour and a half *PRO* to fly from <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> University professor Wong Hon Keong says , " You can get there and back in a day .
You catch the first flight to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> in the morning , stop at the Westin for a coffee and *PRO* to talk business , head to one of the outlying islands in the afternoon for a round of golf , take a stroll downtown , and return to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> that evening . "
But in spite of the convenience for travelers , ties between the two places have been practically invisible for several decades .
What path will the relationship follow *T*-1 now that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> has returned to China ?
As you pass through the offices of <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> government 's</COREF> directorate of administration</COREF> you notice the relative youth of <COREF ID="ectb_1001.part-001-E7" TYPE="IDENT">the staff , most of whom *T*-1 seem *-1 to be in <COREF ID="ectb_1001.part-001-E7" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> thirties</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Rosa Tam , who *T*-1 heads the recruitment and selection division of <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the directorate 's</COREF> human resources department</COREF> , introduces many of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> colleagues with the remark that he or she " studied in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> too . "
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Tam <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF></COREF> graduated from the department of educational psychology at National Taiwan Normal University in 1985 , and joined <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> department of education in 1987 , before *PRO* eventually moving to <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the directorate of administration</COREF> and rising to the post of division chief in just 11 years .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Tam</COREF> is just one of the many <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> civil servants who *T*-1 have studied for degrees in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> government 's</COREF> directorate for administration</COREF> says that around 200 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> civil servants have academic qualifications from <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , but according to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> representative office in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the territory</COREF> , the figure is closer to 1,000 .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> may not represent a very large share of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> 17,000 civil servants , but given that many of those who *T*-1 graduated in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> hold senior ranks , <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> adds something of a " <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> flavor " to <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the government of the <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> SAR -LRB- Special Administrative Region -RRB-</COREF> .
In contrast , <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> alumni</COREF> are noticeable by <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> absence from the SAR government in <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> .
At present , <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the most senior government official 0 *T*-1 to have studied in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> is Ou Wenlong , who *T*-2 graduated in mechanical engineering at National Taiwan University -LRB- NTU -RRB- .
<COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">Ou</COREF> is <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> secretary for transportation and public works , and has been appointed *-1 by Chief Executive Edmund Ho as one of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the SAR government 's</COREF> five administration secretaries .
Amid all the hype surrounding <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> incorporation under the " one country two systems " formula , the sensitive issue of <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">the " <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> connection " within <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> government</COREF></COREF> is little discussed *-2 .
As the clearest example of <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">this connection</COREF> , <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">Ou Wenlong</COREF> is one official that <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">many journalists from <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> have tried *PRO*-2 to get an interview with *T*-1 , but <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> requests have all been turned *-3 down on the grounds that <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the secretary</COREF> is " too busy . "
<COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did nevertheless find time 0 *PRO* to do an interview with <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong 's</COREF> Phoenix TV , during which <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> discoursed freely on the subject of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> development *T*-2 *T*-1 .

Sinorama <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">applied</COREF> , in line with official procedure , for a press pass to the handover ceremony , but <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the application</COREF> was eventually rejected *-1 as " unapproved by the security department . "
On the eve of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the handover</COREF> , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the signboard of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the Taipei Trade and Tourism Office in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF></COREF></COREF> was quietly taken *-1 down , after <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the office</COREF> had been privately warned *-2 *PRO*-2 to remove <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the sign</COREF> before <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the transfer of sovereignty</COREF> .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Office director William Li</COREF> was subsequently reprimanded *-1 by the Mainland Affairs Council for <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> handling of the affair .
None of the above was problems at the time of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong 's</COREF> handover in 1997 , which *T*-1 goes *PRO*-1 to show how cautious <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> SAR government</COREF> is *T*-2 regarding <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
When <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">senior <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> officials</COREF> are asked *-2 about *PRO* having studied in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are always quick *PRO* to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">add</COREF> mention of other academic qualifications obtained * in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> , Lisbon , or mainland China .

Competence and professionalism are what <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> requires *T*-1 from <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> personnel .
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Another graduate of a <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> institution</COREF> declares bluntly that <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> only spent four years in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *PRO*-1 getting <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> degree , and <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the place</COREF> had virtually no effect on <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> at all .

According to statistics from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission , around 6,000 have come in the past ten years , and Professor Wong Hon Keong of Macau University 's Macau Research Center says that 30 % of middle school graduates in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the territory</COREF> have sat <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the overseas enrolment test for college</COREF> in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .

" Semi-liberated area "
Perhaps the reason for the apparent lack of attachment to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> among the many returned <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> alumni can be traced *-1 to historical factors .
In 1966 , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> was convulsed *-1 by <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">rioting in which several people were shot and killed *-3 by Portuguese security forces *T*-2</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The enclave 's</COREF> left - wing groups , which *T*-1 were closely allied *-1 with Beijing , took advantage of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the situation</COREF> *PRO*-4 to get <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">KMT organizations in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF></COREF> shut *-2 down and <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> people expelled *-3 .
Ever since , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> has been regarded *-1 in certain circles in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> as a " semi-liberated area . "
But if <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> pro-Beijing forces are that strong , how come <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">so many students</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">come</COREF> to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *PRO*-1 to get <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> degrees *T*-2 ?
" There are historical reasons for <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> too , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ou Jinrong</COREF> , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">former president of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> Taiwan Alumni Association and a member both of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the Macau SAR 's</COREF> first Selection Committee , and <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Preparatory Committee</COREF> .
Prior to the 1980s , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> lacked <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own colleges , and students had *-1 to go overseas for higher education .
Also , colleges on <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> did n't start *-2 enrolling overseas students until <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the mid-1980s</COREF> , while it *EXP*-1 was difficult *PRO* to gain admission to university in <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> .
Under these circumstances , Taiwanese universities , which *T*-1 actively recruited abroad , were a natural choice for many <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> students .
" In terms of the return 0 you get *T*-1 on your investment , *PRO* taking your degree in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is well worth it , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wang Yun</COREF> , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">acting head of the sanitation and environment division of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> urban administration office</COREF> , who *T*-3 graduated in civil engineering from <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1001.part-003-E10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">National Cheng Kung University</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1001.part-003-E10" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">NCKU</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> in Tainan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> universities have good teachers and decent facilities , says *T*-3 <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> , and <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">students from <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF></COREF> can learn much *ICH*-1 in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> that *T*-2 will benefit <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> careers .
Unlike the colonial administration in <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> , the government of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> under the Portuguese recognized academic credentials issued * by Taiwanese institutions .
It was only in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the mid-1980s</COREF> , once the timetable for the handover of <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> had been agreed *-1 , that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> began *-2 to localize <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the civil service</COREF> in preparation for the transition to " <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> people running <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> .

A number of graduates who *T*-1 had returned from <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *PRO*-1 to work in <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">the private sector</COREF> then shifted to government jobs , and have come *PRO*-2 to form an influential part of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> .
" Little prawns grow into big lobsters if there are no fish in the sea , " smiles *T*-1 <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">Leong Kam Chun , who *T*-2 graduated in business administration from NTU in 1973</COREF> .

" There 's no denying that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> universities have given us a good education , " smiles *T*-1 <COREF ID="203" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Leong Hong Sai</COREF> , <COREF ID="203" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">secretary of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> Taiwan Universities Alumni Association</COREF> .
In addition to the government officials who *T*-1 studied in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">many returned graduates</COREF> have become influential in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> through <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> success in <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">the private sector</COREF> .

Unlike <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">neighboring Hong Kong</COREF> in 1997 , there was no public backlash in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> on the occasion of the handover , and no exodus of emigrants .
Everything seemed *-1 smooth and orderly .
But the people 's primary concern was whether or not <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the incoming SAR administration</COREF> would be capable of *PRO* tackling difficult problems left * behind by <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the Portuguese</COREF> , particularly economic recession and declining public order .
The three " localizations " - of civil administration , the law , and official language - have become a focus of public discussion .
Concern *ICH*-2 has been expressed *-1 that responsibility has been passed *-3 to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">local administrators</COREF> too late , and that <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are too young and inexperienced - statistics from the department of civil service reveal that 61 % of government officials are 40 or under - *PRO*-4 to deal effectively with problems facing <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the newly established SAR</COREF> .
Leong Kam Chun says : " <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> began *-1 nurturing local administrative talent in the mid-1970s , whereas <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> only started *-2 doing so ten years later , in the mid-1980s .
" Several problems *ICH*-2 have already begun *-1 to emerge , such as the question of <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">" legal localization</COREF> . "

Ou Jinrong frankly notes that <COREF ID="22" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Yue Meizhen</COREF> , <COREF ID="22" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">former vice-director of the Taiwan Affairs section of the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua Agency</COREF> , once encouraged <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the alumni</COREF> *PRO*-1 to " do more *PRO*-1 to be a bridge between the two sides .

Friendly factions
On the other hand , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">political divisions</COREF> are not as sharply defined *ICH*-1 in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> as <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *?* in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> , and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> are not so uptight about who <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> come into contact with *T*-2 .
After all , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> covers an area of just 23 sq. km -LRB- roughly equivalent to the Nankang district of Taipei -RRB- and has a population of 430,000 .
As <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Leong Kam Chun</COREF> says , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> " still has the feel of a rural society . "
You bump into the same people all the time in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> , and if you 're too strict about factions , you only make things difficult for yourself .
" Unlike <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> people , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> people</COREF> do n't like *PRO*-2 to talk politics , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Leong</COREF> .

<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Leong</COREF> describes <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> as *PRO* belonging to the pragmatic *PRO* " making - a - living " faction .
Although <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT" S_OFF="4">pro-Beijing</COREF> elements prevail in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the former Portuguese administration</COREF> did n't seem *-2 too bothered about <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">PRC</COREF> pressure when it came to the issue of ties with <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *T*-1 , perhaps because <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> only concern was for people 's livelihood .
Visa - free entry to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> for Taiwanese is a case in point .
Explains *ICH*-1 Wong Hon Keong : " <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> offers visa - free access to residents of over 40 countries with which <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has consular relations *T*-2 , but <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is the only place for which <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> provides visa - free access without there being diplomatic ties *T*-3 . "
Moreover , Taiwanese officials have always had an easier time *PRO*-1 going in *RNR*-2 and out of *RNR*-2 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> , compared with the fuss involved * in *PRO* getting to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> .
For example , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">P.K.

Taiwanese businesspeople in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> form another group that *T*-2 is usually thought of *-2 as *PRO* only concerned * about " *PRO* making a living . "

<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> arrived in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> ten years ago , and ran air - tours by light aircraft until <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the enclave 's</COREF> international airport opened , after which <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> moved into the liquor trade *T*-1 .
When <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> travels to the mainland *T*-1 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> takes <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> Resident 's Permit , but when <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> comes back to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *T*-2 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> uses <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> ROC passport .
As part of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> efforts *PRO* to attract more Taiwanese investors to do business in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> helped introduce President Group CEO Kao Chin - yen to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the territory</COREF> , and in order *PRO* to build better ties with the mainland Chinese , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> helped the Xinhua News Agency in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> to install satellite TV .
But when <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> found that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> elementary - school - age grandson</COREF> was speaking Cantonese all day *T*-1 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> quickly sent <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> back to school in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , *PRO*-2 fearing that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the boy</COREF> was losing <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother tongue .
A consensus among <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwanese living and working in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF></COREF> is that " you ca n't use ideology *PRO* to decide what *T*-1 's right and wrong . "
Another point 0 <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> agree on *T*-1 is that not enough was done *-2 in the past *PRO* to develop ties between <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> , but that with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> change of status , and the corresponding change in atmosphere , things should be different from now on .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Chung - yung</COREF> points out that rents in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> are about 25 % less than rents in Hong Kong , while <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> connections with the European Union means that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> enjoys tax concessions and generous trade quotas .
" <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese businesspeople</COREF> never notice these benefits .

Economic dwarf , cultural giant
But there are also those who *T*-1 think 0 Chen Chung - yung 's attitude is over-optimistic .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen Ming - chih</COREF> , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Taiwanese businessman based * in Dongguan</COREF> , points out that wages in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> are not particularly low and there 's very little spare land , no deepwater harbor and no natural resources , which *T*-1 explains why firms remain more interested in *PRO* investing on <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> than in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Wong Hon Keong</COREF> gives a telling analysis :
" What <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> can offer *T*-1 is a service base , with visa - free access , convenience of travel , and open channels of information .
With <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> for R-AMP-D and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Zhuhai</COREF> as the manufacturing base , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> can provide a window to foreign trade , through which <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">companies</COREF> can increase <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> exports to the EU *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Wong 's</COREF> comments pinpoint the intermediary role that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> plays *T*-1 between <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> .
As Leong Kam Chun notes : " Because <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> is so small and sits rights next to <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> economy is always vulnerable to external factors . "
As soon as the Asian financial crisis hit <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> , the <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> economy was similarly affected *-1 , and unemployment reached 7 % .
Moreover , the contribution made * by Taiwanese businesses to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> is even less than the spillover from <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> firms investing in *PRO* neighboring <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Zhuhai</COREF> .

Apart from economics , what other forms of possible interaction can <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-009-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> share *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> has been a contact point between East and West ever since Portuguese ships first arrived in the 16th century .
As <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Gary Mei</COREF> points out , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the enclave</COREF> was opened *-1 to the outside world more than 300 years before <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> .
During much of the Ming and Qing dynasties , when maritime trade was officially banned *-1 *T*-2 , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> was the shipping hub for the " Silk Road of the Sea , " which *T*-3 extended as far as South Asia , Africa and <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Europe</COREF> in one direction , and Japan , Southeast Asia and South America in the other .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mei</COREF> : " <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is where the Jesuits established the first Western - type university in the Far East , while Chinese scholars such as Hong Xiuquan , Lin Zexu , Liang Qichao , Kang Youwei and Cheng Guanying spent time *ICH*-2 here *PRO*-3 absorbing Western learning *T*-4 . "
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> emerged *PRO*-2 unscathed from WWII , and many of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> original Portuguese - language documents have been preserved *-1 *PRO* intact , *PRO*-1 providing an invaluable resource for research into cultural and religious exchanges between East and West .
In recent years , these archives have attracted particular attention from <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-009-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> scholars</COREF> , notes *?* <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mei</COREF> , *PRO*-1 driven * by interest in the history of East - West exchanges and the influence of maritime culture on <COREF ID="ectb_1001-part-009-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> island</COREF>
Furthermore , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> also serves as an academic and cultural key to the world of the Romance languages .
As <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mei</COREF> explains *?* , there are plenty of old Portuguese texts preserved * in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> , and the university has a sizeable contingent of Portuguese - speaking professors .
Most of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the territory 's</COREF> 10,000 - plus Macanese -LRB- locally born Portuguese -RRB- have elected *PRO*-1 to remain after the handover , and there are several cultural groups dedicated to the work of *PRO* translating Portuguese literature and preserving Portuguese culture .
" Taiwanese who *T*-1 wish *PRO*-1 to study Portuguese do n't have *-2 to go to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Europe</COREF> , " says *T*-3 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mei</COREF> .
" It *EXP*-1 's enough *PRO* to come to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> . "
Though <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> occupies a tiny spit of land , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the former Portuguese colony</COREF> is home to 12 museums of art and history , more than <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> .
" As economic entities go , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> is tiny , " says *?* <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mei</COREF> , " but as a store of culture <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's huge .

Also , the continued provision after <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">the handover</COREF> of visa - free entry for Taiwanese , along with the relative ease with which <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> officials can visit <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the SAR</COREF> *T*-1 , testifies to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Macau 's</COREF> flexibility in these matters .
" <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Macau</COREF> will help *PRO*-1 to boost cross-strait relations , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Wong Hon Keong</COREF> .

Unlike the British in <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> , the Portuguese colonial administration always tried *PRO*-1 to minimize conflict with <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF> , *PRO*-1 promoting compromise and dialogue .
