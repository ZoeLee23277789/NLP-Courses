<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> Stands Up :
*PRO* Moving Toward a Brighter Future
Leaders of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> friendly nations , distinguished guests and compatriots from <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and abroad ;
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is a glorious moment ; <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is also a solemn moment full of hope .
I thank our distinguished guests , who *T*-9 have come here from afar , as well as those friends from around <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> who *T*-1 love democracy and care about <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , for *PRO* sharing <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">this glorious moment</COREF> with <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
We are here <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> , *PRO*-9 not just to celebrate an inauguration , but to witness the flowering of hard - won democratic values and the dawn of a new era .
On the eve of the 21st century , <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> have completed <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">a historic alternation of political parties in power</COREF> .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not only the first of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> kind in the history of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Republic of China</COREF> , but also an epochal landmark for Chinese communities around <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has not only set a new model for the Asian experience of democracy , but has also added an inspiring example to the third wave of democracy <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> over .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">The election for the 10th - term president of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the Republic of China</COREF></COREF> has clearly shown <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> that the fruits of freedom and democracy are not easy 0 *PRO* to come by *T*-1 .
Twenty - three million people , through the power of determined will , have dispelled enmity with love , overcome intimidation with hope , and conquered fear with faith .
With <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> sacred votes <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have proved to <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> that freedom and democracy are indisputable universal values , and that peace is humanity 's highest goal .
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">The outcome of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> year 2000 presidential election</COREF></COREF> is not the victory of an individual or a political party .
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is a victory of <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> as well as a victory for democracy , because <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have , while *PRO* attracting global attention , transcended fear , threats and oppression and bravely risen to <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> feet together .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> stands up , *PRO*-9 demonstrating a firm insistence on reason and a sturdy faith in democracy .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> stands up , *PRO*-9 representing the self - confidence of the people and the dignity of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> stands up , *PRO*-9 symbolizing the quest for hope and the realization of dreams .
Dear compatriots , *PRO* let <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> always remember <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">this moment</COREF> ; let <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> always remember *PRO*-9 to value *RNR*-1 and feel gratitude for *RNR*-1 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , because the fruits of democracy did not come out of the blue .
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> reaped the fruits only after <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had been subjected *-9 to many perils and countless hardships .
If not for the fearless sacrifice of <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> democratic forebears , if not for the unswerving faith of the tens of millions of Taiwanese people in freedom and democracy , <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> could not possibly be standing on <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> beloved land <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> and celebrating a glorious occasion that *T*-9 belongs to <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">all the people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , it is as if <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are standing before a fresh new gate of history .
In the process of democratization , <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwanese people</COREF> have created a brand - new key to <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> shared destiny .
The new century 's gates of hope are *PRO*-1 soon to open .
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are humble but not submissive .
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are full of self - confidence but do not have the slightest bit of complacence .

Since that moment on March 18 when the election results came to light *T*-9 , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have accepted the mandate of all Taiwanese people in a most earnest and humble frame of mind , and have vowed *PRO*-1 to devote all <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> heart , knowledge and courage to *PRO* assuming the heavy responsibility for <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> future .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> personally understand that the significance of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the alternation of political parties and of the peaceful transition of power</COREF> lies not in that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a change of personnel or political parties .
Nor in that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a dynastic change .
Rather , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is the return of state and government power to the people through a democratic procedure .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">The country</COREF> belongs to the people , rather than to any individual or political party .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">The government</COREF> and <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> officials , from the head of state down to the rank - and - file employees , exist for the service of the people .
The alternation of political parties does not mean an across - the - board negation of the past .
We should be fair in *PRO* evaluating the contributions made * by those in power throughout the ages .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lee Teng - hui</COREF> deserves our highest tribute and heartfelt gratitude for <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> promotion of democratic reforms and for <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> excellent performance during <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> twelve years of leadership .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> society has rallied and participated energetically in the election .
Despite the diverse views and stances , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">all individuals</COREF> share the same commitment - *PRO* to come forward for the sake of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> political ideas and <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> future .
We believe that the end of an election is the beginning of reconciliation .
After the curtain falls on emotional campaigns , rationality should prevail .
Under the supreme principles of national interest and the welfare of the people , <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">those in power and in opposition</COREF> should both fulfill <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mandates given * by the people and realize the ideals of fair competition in multiparty politics , as well as the checks and balances of democratic politics .
A democratic society with fair competition , tolerance and trust is the strongest impetus for a nation 's development .
*PRO* Placing national interests above those of political parties , we should solidify the will of the people and seek consensus among the ruling and opposition parties , *PRO*-9 to promote <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> progress and reforms .
<COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">" A government for all people " and " rule by the clean and upright</COREF> " are promises 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> made *T*-9 to the people during the campaign period .
<COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are also <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> key to *PRO* stepping over <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> fault lines and rising to a higher level in the future .
The spirit of " a government for all people " lies in the fact that " <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> exists for the people . "
The people are the masters and shareholders of the state .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">The government</COREF> should rule on the basis of majority public opinion .
The interests of the people should reign supreme over those of any political party or individual .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have always taken pride in *PRO* being a member of the Democratic Progressive Party , but from the moment 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> take <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> oath *T*-2 and assume the presidency *T*-2 , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will put all <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> efforts into *PRO* fulfilling <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> role as a " president for all people . "
As in the formation of the new government , we recruit <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> according to <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> talents and do not discriminate on the basis of ethnicity , gender or party affiliation .

The welfare of the populace shall be our primary goal in the future .
" <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Rule by the clean and upright</COREF> " has as <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> topmost priority the elimination of " black gold " - the involvement of organized crime and moneyed interests in politics - and the eradication of vote - buying .
For a long time , the Taiwanese people have been deeply repelled *-9 by moneyed politics and the interference of organized crime .
Vote - buying in grassroots elections has also robbed <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> right *PRO* to elect the wise and the able , and tainted the development of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> democracy .
Today , I am willing *PRO*-9 to promise that the new government will eliminate vote - buying and crack down on " black gold " politics , so that <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> can rise above such sinking forces and ensure rule by the clean and upright .
We must give the people a clean political environment .
In the area of government reforms , we need *-9 to establish a government that *T*-1 is clean , efficient , far - sighted , dynamic , highly flexible and responsive , in order *PRO* to ensure <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> competitiveness in the face of increasingly fierce global competition .
The age of " large and capable " governments has now passed , *PRO*-1 replaced *-1 by one of " small and effective " governments , which *T*-9 have established partnership relations with the people .
We should accelerate the streamlining of government functions and organization and actively expand the role of public participation .
This will not only allow <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the public</COREF> to fully utilize <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> energy but also significantly reduce the government 's burdens .
Similar partnership relations *ICH*-1 should also be set *-9 up between <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the central and local governments</COREF> .
We want *PRO*-9 to break the authoritarian and centralized control over both power and money .
We want *PRO*-9 to realize the spirit of local autonomy , where <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the local and central governments</COREF> share resources and responsibilities *T*-1 , where " the central government will not do what the local governments can *?* *T*-3 *T*-2 . "
Whether in the east , west , north or south , whether on Taiwan proper or on offshore islands , all will enjoy balanced , pluralistic development , and the gap between urban and rural areas will be reduced *-1 .

We should understand that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is no panacea for all ills .
The driving force for economic development and societal progress is the people .
Over the past half - century , the Taiwanese people have toiled hard *PRO*-9 to create an economic miracle that *T*-1 has won global applause , and to lay the foundation for the survival and development of <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the Republic of China</COREF> .
Today , *PRO*-9 facing the impact of fast - changing information technologies and trade liberalization , <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> must move toward a knowledge - based economy .
High - tech industries need *-9 to be constantly innovative , while traditional ones have *-1 to undergo transformation and upgrading .
In the future , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> should not necessarily play the role of a " leader " or " manager . "
On the contrary , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should be the " supporter " and " service provider , " as *PRO* expected * by private enterprises .
The responsibility of a modern government is *PRO* to raise administrative efficiency , improve the domestic investment environment , and maintain financial order and stock market stability , so as *PRO* to allow the economy to move toward full liberalization and globalization through fair competition .
Based on these principles , the vitality of the public will naturally bloom and create a new phase in <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> economic miracle .
Apart from *PRO* consolidating democratic achievements , promoting government reforms , and raising economic competitiveness , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the new government</COREF> should , as <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> foremost objective , closely watch public opinion and implement reforms accordingly , so that the people on <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">this land</COREF> can live with more dignity , greater self - confidence and a better quality of life .
*PRO* Let our society not only be safe , harmonious and prosperous , but also follow the principles of fairness and justice .
As we cultivate the ever - growing abilities of our citizens , we will let our next generation learn in an environment filled * with happiness and hope .
The 21st century will be a time when " the right to a quality life " and " a refined way of life " are much emphasized *-1 *T*-9 .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The government</COREF> will find <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">solutions for issues relating to the people 's lives , such as law and order , social welfare , environmental protection , land - use planning , waste disposal , river cleaning , transportation and community renewal</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> will also have *-9 to implement <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">these solutions</COREF> thoroughly .
At present , we need *-9 to immediately improve law and order and environmental protection , two important indicators of the quality of life .
We will build a new social order so that the people may live in peace without fear .
A balance *ICH*-1 must be ensured *-9 between nature conservation and economic development so that <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> may develop into a sustainable green silicon island .
Judicial integrity is the bulwark of political democracy and social justice .
An impartial , independent judiciary is a protector of social order and a defender of the people 's rights .
At present , we still have a long way 0 *PRO* to go *T*-9 in our judicial reforms .
<COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">Our compatriots</COREF> must continue *-9 to keep close watch over the judiciary and voice <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> expectations .
At the same time , we should also restrain our administrative power and give the judiciary room 0 *PRO* to operate independently and without interference *T*-1 .

Dear compatriots , 400 years ago <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was called *-1 *PRO*-1 " <COREF ID="5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ihla Formosa</COREF> " - <COREF ID="5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the beautiful island</COREF> - for <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> lustrous landscape .

<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the Republic of China</COREF> , with <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> democratic achievements and technological and economic prowess , can certainly continue *-9 to play an indispensable role in <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the international community</COREF> .
In addition to *PRO* strengthening the existing relations with friendly nations , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want *PRO*-9 to actively participate in all types of international nongovernmental organizations .

We firmly believe that at no time , nor in any corner of the world , can the meaning and values of freedom , democracy and human rights be ignored or changed *-1 .
The 20th century left us with a major lesson - that war is a failure of humanity .
*PRO*-1 Waged * for whatever lofty purposes or high - sounding reasons , war is the greatest harm to freedom , democracy and human rights .
Over the past one hundred plus years , China has suffered imperialist aggression , which *T*-9 left indelible wounds .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has had an even sadder fate , *PRO*-9 tormented *-9 by brute force and colonial rule .
These similar historical experiences should bring mutual understanding between <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the people on the two sides of <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwan Strait</COREF></COREF> , *PRO* setting a solid foundation for *PRO* pursuing freedom , democracy and human rights together .
However , due to the long period of separation , <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the two sides</COREF> have developed vastly different political systems and ways of life , *PRO*-9 obstructing empathy and friendship between <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the people on the two sides</COREF> , and even creating a wall of divisiveness and confrontation .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , as the Cold War has ended , it is time 0 for <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">the two sides</COREF> to cast aside the hostility left * from the old era *T*-1 .

<COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">The people on the two sides of <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwan Strait</COREF></COREF> share the same ancestral , cultural , and historical background .

History has proved that war will lead to more hatred and enmity , without the least help to the development of mutual relations .
Chinese people emphasize the difference between statesmanship and hegemony , *PRO*-9 believing in the philosophy that a government which *T*-1 employs benevolence " will please those near and appeal to <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">those from afar</COREF> , " and " when <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">those from afar</COREF> will not submit *T*-2 , then one must practice kindness and virtue *PRO*-3 to attract <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .

Under the leadership of Mr. Deng Xiaoping and Mr. Jiang Zemin , the mainland has created a miracle of economic openness .
In <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , over a half century , not only have we created a miracle economy , we have also created the political marvel of democracy .

Only by *PRO* adhering to the will of the people can we pioneer the paths of history and build enduring architecture .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , as the son of a tenant farmer with a poor family background , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have struggled and grown on <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">this land</COREF> and , after *PRO* experiencing defeat and tribulation , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have finally won the trust of the people *PRO*-9 to take up the great responsibility of *PRO* leading <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> individual achievements are minor , but the message is valuable because each citizen of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Formosa</COREF> is a " child of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> " just like <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
In whatever difficult environment , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> will be like <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">a selfless , loving mother , who *T*-2 never stops *-2 giving <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> children</COREF> opportunities and who *T*-1 helps <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> realize beautiful dreams</COREF> .
The spirit of the " child of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> " reveals to us that even though <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan , Penghu , Kinmen and Matsu</COREF> are tiny islands on the rim of the Pacific , <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the map of our dreams</COREF> knows no limits .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">The map</COREF> extends all the way to the horizon as long as our 23 million compatriots fear no hardship and move forward hand in hand .
Dear compatriots , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">this magnificent moment</COREF> belongs to all the people .
All grace and glory belongs to <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="126" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Taiwan</COREF> - <COREF ID="126" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">our eternal Mother</COREF></COREF> .
Together , *PRO* let 's extend our gratitude to the earth and our respect to the people .
Long live freedom and democracy !
Long live the people of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> !
We pray for the prosperity of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the Republic of China</COREF> , and for the health and happiness of all compatriots and all our distinguished guests !
