No one would know more *ICH*-1 about <COREF ID="ectb_1021-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> than the older generation in <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
The changes of the past five decades have had a deep impact *ICH*-1 , for example , on <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">the Wu family of <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Yunlin County</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> main claim to fame <COREF ID="ectb_1021-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> ... nothing , actually , and <COREF ID="ectb_1021-part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is precisely why <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> story typifies the experiences of so many *T*-9 .
*PRO* So lend <COREF ID="ectb_1021-part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> attention , <COREF ID="ectb_1021-part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">dear reader</COREF> , as we recount the ups and downs of <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">an average family from <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">a quiet little backwater called * *PRO* Taihsi Township</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Tsung - sheng</COREF> and <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> older sister</COREF></COREF> have come *PRO*-9 to meet <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> at the train station in <COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Touliu</COREF> , <COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">administrative seat of <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Yunlin County</COREF></COREF> .
We pile into a car and head toward <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> parents ' home .
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Tsung - sheng</COREF> fills <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> in on <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hometown</COREF> .
" <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Taihsi</COREF> is a rather unusual place , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tsung - sheng</COREF> , <COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the family 's oldest grandson and a doctoral candidate in sociology at Tunghai University in Taichung</COREF></COREF> .
" When <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> read <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">the studies that *T*-1 describe <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> as *PRO* being so prosperous</COREF> *T*-9 , <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have *-3 to wonder how <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> descriptions could be so totally different from what <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> lives have been *T*-5 *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> might as well be talking about a different planet . "
Probably most people do n't realize , adds *?* <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">Tsung - sheng</COREF> , that there are still places *ICH*-1 in <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> as backward as <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Taihsi</COREF> .
To the outsider , however , <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the place</COREF> does n't look backward at all .
As <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">Tsung - sheng</COREF> drives west in a very nice Toyota at a comfortable speed down a broad county highway , <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> older sister</COREF> sits in the front passenger seat with cell phone in hand *PRO*-1 discussing the traffic situation with someone at home .
In the meantime , <COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">Tsung - sheng 's</COREF> five - year - old nephew</COREF> clamors from the back seat for <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother</COREF> to buy <COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a Pokemon plaything , just like kids the world over are doing *?* these days .
When McDonald 's stores in <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> were swamped *-2 last year during a giveaway of Hello Kitty dolls *T*-9 , <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">lots of people</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> might be able *PRO*-1 to beat the crowds by *PRO* hitting McDonald 's in <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">supposedly untrendy Taihsi</COREF> , but <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> found the lines there every bit as long as in more urban locations .

The emperor is far away
The scenery grows increasingly rural as <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> move west through the townships of Huwei , Tuku , Paochung , and Tungshih .
Temples tower over green rice fields .
Less than half an hour after *PRO* leaving the train station <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> get off the county highway and onto narrow Tungshih East Road .
When <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> reach <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> destination in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">rural Taihsi Township</COREF> *T*-9 , a few dozen buildings of modern ferroconcrete construction line the road , and shops of every description occupy the ground floor of each one .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Tsung - sheng 's</COREF> parents , who *T*-9 are pushing 60 years old ,</COREF> run a local bakery , and <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> greet <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> with the wide smiles and warm hospitality so typical of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">haikou -LRB- as the locals are accustomed *-1 to *PRO* calling <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Taihsi</COREF> and the surrounding townships near the coast in western Yunlin County *PRO*-2 *?* -RRB-</COREF> .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also speak Taiwanese with an unmistakable haikou accent .
*PRO*-9 To welcome <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> guest <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have ordered a big seafood meal in advance .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Tsung - sheng 's</COREF> grandmother , parents , uncles , aunts , cousins , nephews , and nieces have all come in from around <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">haikou</COREF> for the gathering .
The strength of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the Wu clan 's</COREF> family ties is plainly evident .
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">These people</COREF> go back for generations here .
From the destruction of World War II to the mixed joy and grief of the early post-war years , from the barest of rural hamlets to a prosperous little town , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">this family</COREF> has seen it all .

<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">84 - year - old grandma Wu</COREF> is not as sharp as <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> used *-9 to be *?* , but <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> can still rattle off a tale or two .
Two indignities suffered * back in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the 1940s</COREF> , in particular , remain indelibly etched in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> memory .
The first occurred in the latter part of World War II when the Japanese tied <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> hands behind <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> back *T*-1 and marched <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> off *PRO* to do forced labor for over a year , *PRO*-2 building roads , digging ditches , and carrying a shoulder pole .
The second indignity was the onerous taxes that *T*-9 were levied *-9 in the early years after <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> returned to Chinese rule .
" We had *-9 to pay taxes twice a year , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">grandma Wu</COREF> , *PRO*-1 flashing a mouthful of dental work .
" The first time was for water , and the second was for land .
It *EXP*-2 did n't matter whether you even had a crop 0 *PRO* to harvest *T*-3 or not - you had *-1 to pay , or they 'd throw you in jail . "
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> explains that <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">one dou</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">10 liters</COREF> -RRB- of rice back in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the 1940s</COREF> was worth five or six yuan , or about four days ' pay for a manual laborer , but the tax on <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">one jia</COREF> of land -LRB- <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">0.97 hectares</COREF> -RRB- was 150 yuan .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">A lot of people</COREF> had *-1 to borrow money *PRO*-1 just to pay <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> taxes .
" It *EXP*-2 took four days *PRO* to earn <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">one dou of rice</COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">grandma Wu</COREF> .
" <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> could n't afford *PRO*-9 to eat <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , because <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> needed <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 to pay <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> taxes . "
Although <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the Kuomintang government</COREF> eventually carried out <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">land reform</COREF> *PRO* to provide relief for poor farmers , <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the Wu family</COREF> never shared in the benefits .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were as poor as <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> neighbors</COREF> , *PRO* to be sure , but <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> owned land and were thus classified *-3 as small landowners , which *T*-4 by definition meant that <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> neither had any extra land 0 *PRO* to rent *T*-2 out nor did <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> rent from others .
While many of <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> neighbors</COREF> received land as a result of <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the reforms</COREF> , <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the Wu family</COREF> got nothing .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Grandma Wu</COREF> was close to 30 years old when <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the Kuomintang</COREF> <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">recovered</COREF> <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> from <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> , but <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the event</COREF> meant little to <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> *T*-9 , for <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had never received any schooling .
All 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> remembers *T*-9 is that when the war ended *T*-1 , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was turned *-2 over to " <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> . "
With a grin , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">grandma Wu</COREF> throws up <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> hands in a gesture of helplessness and quips , " When <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the colonial government</COREF> spoke *T*-1 , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't understand <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> Japanese .
When <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the Kuomintang</COREF> speaks *T*-9 , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't understand <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> Mandarin either . "
" There 's no difference between <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese government</COREF> and <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the Kuomintang</COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Grandma Wu</COREF> .
" If <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">something important</COREF> comes up , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> send a local official out *PRO* to make an announcement and explain what <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's all about *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Tsung - sheng</COREF> adds , " They 're totally outside the loop here .
You of course know <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">the phrase , ' Heaven is high and the emperor is far away</COREF> . '
Well , it was people like <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> grandmother</COREF> who *T*-9 coined <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> . "

*PRO* Orphaned * and blind in one eye , a hard life lay in store for <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> , but <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> made the best of a bad situation .
With no male siblings 0 *T*-9 to carry on the family line , at age 25 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> managed *PRO*-1 to find <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">a husband who *T*-2 was willing *PRO*-2 to let <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first male child take the Wu surname</COREF> .

But it *EXP*-1 is clear that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> does live reasonably well now .
When did survival cease *PRO*-1 to be such a struggle *T*-9 ?
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Grandma Wu</COREF> remembers quite clearly when the turning point came *T*-9 .
It was in the early 1980s , when <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> oldest grandchild was already a teenager *T*-9 , that business gradually started *-1 going better for <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> three sons</COREF> *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">The three brothers</COREF> got together and decided that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should each give <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> NT$ 2,000 *U* every month .

<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was enough *PRO*-1 to cover meals , and <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> life</COREF> improved even more .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Grandma Wu</COREF> now lives together with several other old folks very near the coast in the old traditional farmhouse where <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> grew up *T*-9 .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> main worry these days is <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> granddaughter in Taipei , who *T*-9 is in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> 30s and still unmarried</COREF> .

Without *PRO* pausing *PRO* to take in the sights of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the big city</COREF> , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Chien - lo</COREF> went straight *PRO*-1 to work at a construction site , where <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> carried a shoulder pole and mixed cement *T*-2 .
Buildings were going up everywhere in <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei</COREF> in the mid-1950s , and <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> was bursting with opportunities .

<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't have what it took *T*-9 *PRO* to think about a career in <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei</COREF> .

Taiwan back then was one of the world s biggest producers of sugar cane , but the harvest was extremely difficult work , as <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Chien - lo</COREF> is painfully aware .

" In a rural area like this , " says *?* <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Chien - lo</COREF> , " family members work together , and everybody shares equally in the success . "

*PRO* Sacrificing for the kids
Although <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may be loath *PRO*-9 to spend frivolously on <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Chien - lo</COREF> and <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife</COREF></COREF> consider money no object when it comes to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children 's</COREF> education *T*-1 .
" The reason 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> worked so hard around the clock for so many years *T*-9 was because <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were afraid that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> might not be able *PRO*-1 to do right by <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> kids</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> were worried *-3 that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> might fall in with the wrong crowd after <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> got into junior high , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Wu</COREF> , *PRO*-1 adding that <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Taihsi</COREF> is well known for the fact that <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has " lots of dust in the air , lots of yams , and lots of gangsters . "
*PRO*-1 To keep <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> kids</COREF> out of trouble <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> sent <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">all four of them</COREF> off to <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">a well - known Catholic boarding school in <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Touliu</COREF></COREF> as soon as <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> reached junior high .
Each child spent six years there -LRB- except for the second daughter , who *T*-2 only attended for three years -RRB- , and every weekend <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the two parents</COREF> would pack up lots of goodies and take the bus *PRO*-1 to see <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> kids</COREF> .
It was a difficult trip , and required several transfers .
The total cost of one year 's tuition plus room and board at <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the private school</COREF> came to <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">more than NT$ 150,000 *U* per child</COREF> .
With four kids at <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF> , the financial burden was substantial , *PRO*-9 especially considering the fact that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were spending <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">these sums</COREF> back in the mid-1980s .
The struggle *PRO* to pay tuition took every ounce of energy 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had *T*-9 .
" That 's the responsibility 0 you bear *T*-9 as a parent .
You want *PRO*-9 to see your children succeed , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Chien - lo</COREF> .
Luckily , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">all four of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> children</COREF> were good students and had no problem *PRO*-1 passing <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> university entrance examinations .
In <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> little hometown , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Tsung - sheng</COREF> and <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> siblings</COREF> are noted *-9 for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> excellent academic achievements .
The result has been a bit comical in at least one respect , for <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the eldest daughter</COREF> was so strictly observant of <COREF ID="135" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the prohibition against *PRO* speaking <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> in school</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="135" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a rule formerly enforced * throughout Taiwan</COREF> -RRB- that <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> does n't even speak <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> very well any more .
After *PRO* graduating from National Taiwan Normal University in Taipei , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> came back to Yunlin County several years ago *PRO*-1 to teach senior high school in <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Touliu</COREF> , and now <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> makes people laugh every time 0 <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> opens <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mouth *PRO*-3 to speak <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> odd brand of <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese</COREF> *T*-2 .

In the view of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Tsung - sheng</COREF> , the heavy emphasis that rural parents put *T*-1 on education does n't have so much 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 with the idea of *PRO* getting ahead , but stems mainly from a deep respect for learning .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> parents</COREF> are not interested in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> specialty</COREF> , nor do <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know anything about <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , but <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have never objected to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> chosen path , nor did <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say a word when <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> younger brother</COREF> switched <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> major from business management to sociology *T*-9 .
This long leash is all the more impressive in view of the fact that there is no chance that either of these sociology majors will ever be able *PRO*-9 to make a living near home -LRB- because there are no major universities or research institutions in Yunlin County -RRB- .
" *PRO*-9 Thinking back on it , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> realize that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> parents</COREF> began *-1 encouraging <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> *PRO*-3 very early to aim high and not feel like <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had *-2 to stay near home .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">We all</COREF> started boarding school at age twelve and then went on to university in Taipei .
As <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> got older , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> went back home less and less . "
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> studies ended up *-2 weakening <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ties to <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hometown , notes *T*-1 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Tsung - sheng</COREF> wistfully .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> parents</COREF> , in the meantime , are doing everything 0 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can *?* *T*-1 *PRO*-9 to make it *EXP*-2 easier for <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the children</COREF> to come back home if necessary .
For starters , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've built a multi-story house with a separate floor set * aside for each of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the children</COREF> .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Chien - lo</COREF> explains , " <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> two boys</COREF> have n't started *-9 working or gotten married yet .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hope 0 <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll be able *PRO*-9 to make a go of it off in some city , but if it does n't work out <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can always come back and tend the store . "
It *EXP*-1 would probably make better business sense , in fact , *PRO* to close the store .
People have been moving away from the haikou area for many years , and the local economy is in the doldrums .
What *T*-9 's more , it *EXP*-1 will only get more and more difficult *PRO* to make money *PRO* running an old - fashioned mom and pop store now that a new convenience store has opened up across the street .
Even so , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the couple</COREF> is n't yet ready *PRO*-9 to call it *PRO*-1 quits .
It is for <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children 's</COREF> sake that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stay in business *T*-1 .

*PRO* Hoping for more democracy
When the subject turns to politics and <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> independence *T*-9 , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the normally outspoken Wu Chien - lo</COREF> suddenly grows cautious .
" It does n't matter who *T*-9 wins the election .
They 're all good candidates .
We 'll just have *-9 to wait and see . "
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Tsung - sheng</COREF> understands the reasons for <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father 's</COREF> reticence quite well .
Yunlin County politics are riddled *-9 with factionalism and the influence of organized crime , and you can find ample proof *ICH*-1 here that all politics are indeed local .
With over 40 voters in <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the extended family</COREF> , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the Wu clan</COREF> is a plum of a voting block .
All the local factions eagerly woo <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Chien - lo , who *T*-9 has in the past gotten deeply involved in politics and taken to the streets in support of certain candidates</COREF> .
Over the years , however , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has learned that it *EXP*-1 is best *PRO* to avoid *PRO* offending people , and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> now plays <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> cards close to the vest .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Tsung - sheng</COREF> explains that local politics in the haikou area are linked *-9 only tenuously to what *T*-1 goes on in distant Taipei , and the concept of democracy has n't made much headway here .
The locals are most concerned about what public figure *T*-9 " gives people face " by *PRO* showing up at weddings and funerals , and who *T*-2 has close personal ties with whom .
What *T*-1 is more , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">vote buying</COREF> is accepted *-3 with breezy indifference , as if <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> were the normal thing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 .
However , says *?* <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tsung - sheng</COREF> , local politics probably wo n't be so dirty once the younger generation becomes more influential .
Fifty years of struggle have brought prosperity to <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">our island</COREF> .
Will it *EXP*-1 take another fifty years *PRO* to establish a mature democracy ?
