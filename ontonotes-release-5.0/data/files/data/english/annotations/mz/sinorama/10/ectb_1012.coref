The last of this generation of domestically produced Ching - kuo fighter planes takes off for routine maneuvers .
Defense thinking in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is changing *PRO* to meet the challenges of advanced technology .
As the first Chinese New Year of the new millenium approaches , changes *ICH*-1 are underway which *T*-2 are drawing attention to the long - term prospects for military and defense affairs in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
The Legislative Yuan has finally passed <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">the long - discussed National Defense Law and Coastal Defense Law</COREF> .
<COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> establish new regulations governing issues which *T*-1 have long been a focus of public concern , including unification of the military chain of command , alteration of the weapons procurement process , establishment of a flexible military service system , and transfer of defense responsibilities for remote offshore islands .
In addition , as the presidential election battle heats up , cross-strait security issues - especially those related * to missiles and missile defense - have again come up in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , with <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">candidates</COREF> rushing *PRO*-1 to put forward <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own strategic thinking .
*PRO* Faced with the turbulent cross-strait situation , can <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> military ensure security ?
How should <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> respond to <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China 's</COREF> active development of a missile attack capability *T*-1 ?
Will pro-active construction of a missile defense system raise tensions between the two sides ?
How can <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> defend <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> without *PRO* provoking an irrational response from <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> *T*-1 ?
Two national defense topics have been especially hot in this new year .
One is that defense of the remote Pratas and Spratley Islands will be transferred *-1 to the Coast Guard Command .
The second is <COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">the subject of missile defense</COREF> .
Both <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">Kuomintang presidential candidate Lien Chan</COREF> and Democratic Progressive Party presidential candidate Chen Shui - bian have commented on <COREF ID="241" TYPE="IDENT">the subject</COREF> .
Last December , at a seminar at the Armed Forces University entitled " * *PRO* Transmillennial National Security and Military Strategy , " <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> delivered an address entitled " * *PRO* National Defense Strategy and Construction in the New Century . "
<COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> suggested that <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> will have *-1 to develop long - range missiles *PRO* to counter the mainland Chinese military threat .
While <COREF ID="274" TYPE="IDENT">" effective deterrence "</COREF> would remain the cornerstone of strategy , <COREF ID="274" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should no longer be passive , said *?* <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> , but " pro-active . "
The new generation of military capability will be based *-1 , <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *?* , on the principle of " offensive defense . "
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="001">
The best defense is *?* ....
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> raised a similar idea .
In <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> " Defense Policy White Paper , " <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> proposed *PRO*-1 developing medium - and short - range surface - to - surface missiles .
Obviously , after the experience of the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis , people in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> have considered *PRO* defending <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> against mainland Chinese missile attack to be one of the foremost defense problems .
Interestingly , even as such " pro-active defense " ideas are being proposed *-1 , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Ministry of National Defense</COREF> <COREF ID="24" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- MND -RRB-</COREF></COREF> has made a seemingly contrary move : <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has announced that military forces will be withdrawn *-2 from <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the remote offshore Pratas and Spratley islands</COREF> , and that responsibility for <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">these islands</COREF> and for coastal patrolling will be transferred *-3 to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Coast Guard</COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">The MND</COREF> argues that since the military is being streamlined *-1 , in order *PRO* to concentrate defense forces in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , Penghu , Kinmen , and Matsu , the defense of <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the Pratas and Spratley islands - which *T*-2 are in the South China Sea</COREF> - and the protection of coastal fishing vessels and coastal security should be left *-3 to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Coast Guard</COREF> .
*PRO* Withdrawing from <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the two islands groups</COREF> while *PRO* moving actively *PRO* to build a missile system may look like contradictory moves , but in fact <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're both part of the military blueprint for the future - the abandonment of initial use of military force , but the ability *PRO* to retaliate when *PRO* attacked * *T*-2 .
The military blueprint for the new century is still being drawn *-1 up .
The stimulus for these new ideas has been the aggressive military deployments by <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> aimed * at <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="97" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lin Cheng - yi</COREF> , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a research fellow at the Institute of European and American Affairs at the Academia Sinica</COREF></COREF> , says that the successful testing by <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> of missiles in 1996 has altered the lines of strategic thought on both sides of the strait .
Guided missiles have replaced aircraft as the major threat to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
In recent years <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> has also constructed short - range surface - to - surface missile bases *ICH*-1 along <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Southeast Coast which *T*-2 are specifically targeted *-2 at <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
According to a report in the December 22 , 1999 Washington Post , in November US reconnaissance satellites discovered that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> had begun *-1 constructing a new air defense missile base in the Zhangzhou region along the southeast coast .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Cheng - yi</COREF> says that , besides *PRO* rapidly building missile bases , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> has repeatedly stated that " there should be a timetable for resolution of the <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> problem . "
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">The PRC 's</COREF> extremely assertive deployment of armed capability opposite <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is deeply felt *-1 in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> does not respond in time , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be forced *-1 into an increasingly passive position .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="163" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lt. Gen. Fuh Wei - ku</COREF> , <COREF ID="163" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">commandant of the Air Command and General Staff College at the Armed Forces University</COREF></COREF> , notes that for the moment <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> still has a slight edge in terms of air defense .
However , it *EXP*-2 is widely <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">estimated</COREF> *-1 that by 2005 , there will be a shift in the military capabilities of the two sides .
Although <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">this prediction</COREF> is not necessarily accurate , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> should work *PRO*-1 to maintain <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> edge so as *PRO* to guarantee peace through strength .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Fuh Wei - ku</COREF> offers the following analysis : Currently <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">PRC</COREF> weapons which *T*-1 pose the greatest threat to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> are <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">Sukhoi aircraft</COREF> , <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">M - class missiles</COREF> , and cruise missiles .
Of <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> , <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the aircraft</COREF> are already strategically of the second rank , but <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> must be alert to the missiles .
<COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">The M - class weapons</COREF> can pass through the stratosphere directly into <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> rear areas , while cruise missiles can undertake low - level long - range attacks .
" <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> can defend against <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the M - class missiles</COREF> with our Patriot missile defense system , but <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> currently have only limited ability *PRO*-1 to intercept cruise missiles .
The most important subject for the moment is *PRO* to rethink air defense strategy , " <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .

Missile difficulties
Any discussion of missiles also involves many other issues , including international strategy and domestic civilian morale .
From the point of view of international strategy , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> clearly does not want <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> to develop <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own offensive missile capability .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">The US</COREF> responded negatively to Lien Chan 's proposal *PRO* to build long - range missiles .
At <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the State Department 's</COREF> end - of - year press conference , US Under Secretary of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">State</COREF> for Arms Control John Holum said that <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> did not want *PRO*-1 to see <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> take any action which *T*-3 would violate the basic norms of the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime .
Thus <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> would not be happy *PRO*-2 to see <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> develop offensive long - range missile systems .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Kuo Cheng - liang</COREF> , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a professor of political science at Soochow University</COREF> , says that <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> opposes <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> development of long - range missiles because of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the US 's</COREF> long - range strategy vis - a - vis <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">The US</COREF> has always been responsible for strategic deterrence , while <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> handles local tactical defense .
If <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> were *PRO* to <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">develop</COREF> long - range missiles , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> would change <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> defensive posture , and alter the <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> - US military division of labor .
There is another possibility for <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> in *PRO* defending against the threat of missiles from <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> .
Besides *PRO* building offensive systems , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> could also <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">join</COREF> <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="ectb_1012-part-002-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">US Theater Missile Defense</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1012-part-002-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">TMD</COREF> -RRB- plan</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> may not be feasible , says *T*-1 <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Bih Chung - ho</COREF> , <COREF ID="85" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">editor - in - chief of the defense magazine Defense Technology Monthly</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says that if <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> were *PRO* to <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">join</COREF> <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the TMD</COREF> <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> would be a return to a situation of joint US - <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> defense , such as *PRO* existed during the Cold War , when <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was on the frontline in a chain of islands surrounding <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> *T*-2 .
For <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC , which *T*-1 is endeavoring *PRO*-1 to move from coastal defense to a blue - water capability</COREF> , the provocation would be enormous .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">The United States</COREF> has thus been deliberately unclear - <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does not exclude <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> from <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the TMD</COREF> , but <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has not clearly said that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> would be included *-1 .
In any case , says *?* <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lin Chong - pin</COREF> , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">vice-chairman of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC 's</COREF> Mainland Affairs Council</COREF> , potential <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">TMD</COREF> buyers still do not know where the money would come from *T*-1 , while the <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">TMD</COREF> producer has not yet come up with a finished product .
So this is still just a political debating point , and it is too early *PRO* to talk about any impact on the military situation in the Taiwan Strait .

Domestic morale
Thus , from the international strategic angle , it *EXP*-1 still seems *-2 most practical for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own missile systems .
Moreover , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is also necessary from the point of view of public opinion .
In an analysis of the threat that guided missiles pose *T*-1 to morale in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">ROC</COREF> Minister of Defense Tang Fei</COREF> points out that perhaps for some countries a missile attack would have little impact .
But in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , where resources are concentrated *-1 *T*-2 , missiles pose a serious threat to electrical power and petroleum production , to transportation -LRB- harbors , highways , airports , railroads -RRB- , and to factories .
More importantly , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *?* , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the citizens of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> are not psychologically prepared .
There has been no war for decades now , and there are even very few usable civil defense shelters .
If <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> were *PRO* to launch 200 - 300 guided missiles against <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , although the damage to industry , power , and communications would probably not be as serious as *PRO* was caused * by the September 21 earthquake , citizens are not psychologically prepared for war , and the economy might not be able *PRO*-2 to withstand the assault .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chung Chien</COREF> , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an expert on military affairs</COREF> , says that the turbulence created * in the public mind by the 1996 <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">PRC</COREF> missile tests has not abated even today .
The construction of an effective missile defense system is the main military problem in *PRO* bringing peace of mind to <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> citizens</COREF> .
Thus , in the presidential elections , although <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">missile defense</COREF> can not be said *-1 *-1 to be " the beef " of campaigning , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is still an important " side dish " that many citizens are concerned about *T*-2 .

Beyond missiles
If <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> can not develop long - range missiles or participate in the TMD plan , what effective strategic options *T*-1 are left *-1 ?
Fuh Wei - ku points out that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> domestically produced Sky Bow and Sky Sword missiles have defensive capability .
But pure defense is not enough .
Even if missile defense could be 99 % effective , and only one percent of attacking missiles got through , the situation could still be a total loss .
Thus , it *EXP*-1 would be more effective *PRO* to build an offensive missile system *PRO* to deter the enemy .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> domestically produced Hsiung Feng missiles have over - the - horizon attack capability , and could remain the main focus of future research and development .
Bih Chung - ho adds that it *EXP*-2 should be no problem , *PRO* using the resources of the Chungshan Institute of Technology , *PRO* to manufacture <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">short - range surface - to - surface missiles</COREF> <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- SSMs -RRB-</COREF> without *PRO* relying on purchases from overseas .
Previous missile programs , including the Ching Feng and Tien Ma , all envisioned similar short - range SSMs -LRB- with a range of 500 or so kilometers -RRB- .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Cheng - yi</COREF> says that it *EXP*-2 is indeed feasible for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> military *PRO* to <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">develop</COREF> an effective retaliatory capability ; <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">development</COREF> could focus on short - range SSMs and an air - to - surface attack capability , which *T*-1 could expand the battlefield beyond <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> points to other countries that *T*-1 have a doctrine of *PRO* extending the battlefield outside national territory .
For example , <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">South Korea</COREF> has developed <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own SSMs , Singapore has airborne refueling capability , and <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> has a strategy of *PRO* keeping the fighting outside <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> borders as much as possible .
Of course , <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">different countries</COREF> are in different situations , and the external threats faced * by <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">these countries</COREF> are not comparable to the cross-strait situation .
PRC military affairs expert Alex Kao concludes that although <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the idea of *PRO* taking a war beyond <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> is worth consideration , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would only be really useful if <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could be adopted *-1 into the national security structure and done *-1 in an integrated and comprehensive way .

Defense alternatives
Although *PRO* constructing a missile system is a main focus of defense thinking in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , effective use of high - tech weaponry depends on the quality of military personnel and , moreover , can not be seen *-1 as a panacea for all defense problems .
The problem of personnel quality has in fact been a focus of serious concern in recent years .
For example , over the last two years <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the Air Force</COREF> has lost six fighter planes in accidents , *PRO* revealing a serious weakness in *PRO* managing high - tech weapons .
Fuh Wei - ku says that the problem is not <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">one of *PRO* integrating the different types of weaponry bought * from the " mini-United Nations " of sources from which <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has acquired high - tech arms *T*-1</COREF> , because <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the military</COREF> accounted for <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">this problem</COREF> already .
Rather , the main problem is in the nation 's military service system , which *T*-1 makes it *EXP*-2 difficult *PRO* to retain soldiers long enough *PRO* to cultivate expertise .
Most of the problems with high - tech weapons have in fact been human error .
At the ceremony marking the commissioning of <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the fifth F - 16 squadron</COREF> held * last December in Hualien , there were " more planes than pilots . "
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">This newly established 26th Fighter Squadron</COREF> has 18 fighter aircraft , but less than 10 pilots .
According to <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the Air Force</COREF> , this problem is the result of the transition period to a new generation of aircraft .
For <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">pilots</COREF> to qualify for the new aircraft , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must have at least 400 hours of flying experience .
But <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> pilots get limited time in the air , so there are n't enough qualified pilots .
Experts explain that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has limited airspace , and virtually no space for training .
Moreover , it seems , 0 virtually all of the first group of pilots who *T*-1 went abroad *PRO*-1 to receive training for new fighter aircraft have left <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the military</COREF> *PRO*-2 to fly for civilian airlines , so the problem of talent outflows is severe .
The same applies to other types of high - tech material .

Doctrine , not weapons
It *EXP*-2 is bad enough that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">high - tech weapons</COREF> may be rendered *-1 *PRO*-1 irrelevant by the inability *PRO* to utilize <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> properly .
Another problem is that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> might be bypassed *-1 altogether by a different enemy strategy .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Alex Kao</COREF> warns that currently both public commentators and <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the military 's</COREF> own research <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">focus</COREF> on the possibility that the first wave of warfare in the Taiwan Strait will be a missile attack .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> ignores the evolution of land - sea - air joint operations in modern warfare .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Mainland China</COREF> need not choose *PRO*-1 to use high - cost , limited - quantity guided missiles , but could instead use a large number of 360 - km range rockets *PRO*-1 to first attack <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> air fields from the Chinese coast , *PRO* thereby paralyzing <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> air superiority .
Then , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> navy could ferry raiders to <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> in less than one hour .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Kao</COREF> recalls that Vietnamese land forces were used *-1 *PRO*-1 to infiltrate US air fields in Vietnam and neutralize American air superiority .
Particularly now that the Coastal Defense Law has been passed *-1 , and responsibility for coastal patrols will pass to the non-military Coast Guard Command , if <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> military</COREF> still <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">operates</COREF> under the traditional assumption of *PRO* first establishing air and sea superiority followed * by defense on land , <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> could give <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> an opportunity *PRO* to strike a death blow .
" Although <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is merely a hypothesis , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> points to a blind spot : the first strike will not necessarily be missiles .

Third wave warfare
Even as discussion on missile systems continues , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an unprecedented form of threat</COREF> - <COREF ID="8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">third - wave warfare</COREF> - is lurking .
Lin Chong - pin says that currently both sides are engaged in third - wave - warfare development .
This type of warfare is divided *-1 into " hard kill " and " soft kill . "
Hard kill refers to the deployment on missile warheads of weapons with directional capability - using , for example , lasers , microwaves , electromagnetic pulse , and particle beams - which *T*-1 could increase the destructiveness of missiles .
" Soft kill " refers to computer viruses and electronic interference 0 *T*-1 to destroy the enemy 's computer systems , and thereby to neutralize the enemy 's military capability in a bloodless manner .
Some people see in third - wave warfare an opportunity *PRO* to seize a decisive advantage in the face of a future armed threat from <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> .
*PRO* To be sure , because of the domestic development of the electronics industry in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF> has a certain advantage .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">The military</COREF> is currently actively studying the construction of information war capability , and <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> hopes *PRO*-1 to cooperate with the private sector and utilize private - sector computer knowledge *PRO*-2 to jointly deploy an electronics defense network .
This is a key area of development for the future in which <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> can rely on <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> and need not be limited *-1 by what *T*-2 can be procured *-2 abroad *T*-3 .
Construction of a complete defense system is essential , but the highest form of military strategy is still *PRO* to defeat the enemy without *PRO* firing a shot .
In fact , the pro-active defense 0 <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is currently studying *T*-1 is a way of *PRO* pursuing peace .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> will not provoke <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> , nor be the first 0 *T*-1 to resort to war .
But nor can <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> allow <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> to think that <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is so weak that <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> will be tempted *-1 *PRO*-1 to act rashly .
Pro-active defense is necessary for <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , but the real goal of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwan side</COREF> is peace .
Perhaps militarily there 's a standoff situation of mutual intimidation , but what <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> most hopes for *T*-1 is that the cross-strait problem can be peacefully resolved *-2 without *PRO* deploying a single soldier .
