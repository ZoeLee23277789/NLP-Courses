" At the End of Rainbows " Looking for Palauan Pots of Gold
" From <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> point of view , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> is like a freshly opened oyster , when you first see the shining pearl *T*-1 . "
So declares *T*-1 <COREF ID="119" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Gennie Yen</COREF> , <COREF ID="119" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the director of the <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">ROC</COREF> Office of the Palau Visitors Authority</COREF> .
*PRO* To be sure , since the establishment of diplomatic relations between <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF> and <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> last December 29 , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> has received considerable media attention in <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
The number of <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> visitors to <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> in January was double the number of last January .
In March , foreign minister Chen Chien - jen led a delegation *ICH*-1 to <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> which *T*-2 included government officials , private sector business people , and representatives of the mass media .
And in April , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the Taipei office of the Palau Visitors Authority</COREF> formally opened <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> doors .
This " <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> fever " has also infected <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> business people , who *T*-1 are always " susceptible " to new opportunities .
*PRO* Building on the foundation of formal diplomatic relations , <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">many Taiwanese firms</COREF> are anxious *PRO* to try <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hand and to explore <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Palau 's</COREF> investment environment .
A guidebook describes <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">this beautiful archipelago nation in the South Pacific</COREF> as *PRO* being " at the end of rainbows . "
Though this may seem *-3 far , far away , in fact , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> *ICH*-1 is geographically the closest to <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> of all the countries with which <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF> has formal diplomatic ties *T*-2 .
A direct flight takes only three - and - a - half hours .
Perhaps for Taiwanese , there are rather more immediate implications to " the end of rainbows . "
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">This unfamiliar and exotic land</COREF> is a virgin territory of commercial opportunities for tourism , trade and investment .

Jewels in the Pacific
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF></COREF> share much more in common *ICH*-1 in terms of culture and historical position than most people realize *?* .
The people of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> are of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the same ethnic background as the aboriginal people of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> - <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Malayo - Polynesian</COREF> .
Last year when the inaugural Polynesian Cultural Festival was held *-1 in Taitung County *T*-2 , scholars and arts troupes from <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> were among the participants .
During the modern age of Western and Japanese colonialism , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">both <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF></COREF> experienced foreign rule which *T*-1 has left traces of Spanish , Japanese , American , and other cultures .
After WWII , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was returned *-1 to Chinese rule , while <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> became a UN trust territory under US authority .
-LRB- <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> did not gain full independence until 1994 . -RRB-
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> - <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> political contacts <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">began</COREF> in the 1980s .
In 1983 , President Haruo I. Remeliik led the first Palauan delegation to <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
There have been numerous official visits since then .
In 1984 , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the two countries</COREF> signed an agricultural cooperation agreement , and <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> dispatched a technical assistance team there .
Since <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the beginning of exchanges between the two governments</COREF> , Taiwanese business people have been conducting trade with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> , and have also invested there , *PRO*-1 entering the restaurant , fishing , retail , and other trades .
During the Taiwan Strait missile crises in 1995 and 1996 , when rumors and panic filled the air *T*-1 , fraudulent business groups in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> cheated many investors with <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">a scam surrounding real estate in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF></COREF> , but there was a silver lining to <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">this cloud</COREF> : <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> attracted the attention of more <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> business people , and especially the domestic tourism industry , to business opportunities in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Bin - fang Stone , now director of the Palau - ROC Friendship Association</COREF> , was one of those who *T*-1 came to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> at that time *PRO*-1 to explore the possibility of investment in real estate .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Stone</COREF> states : " Before independence , there was a serious lack of tourist facilities in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> .
Most of the visitors were in specially - organized groups from the US or Japan which *T*-1 came for deep sea fishing or scuba diving .
It was only when <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> tourist agencies began *-1 developing the tourist route to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> *T*-2 that many Taiwanese began *-3 to invest in <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the tourism industry here</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="156" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Snorkeling</COREF> , <COREF ID="156" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the most popular activities in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF></COREF> , was brought *-1 in by <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese entrepreneurs</COREF> , and you could say that <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have been among the founders of <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the Palauan tourism industry</COREF> .
Currently there are <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">more than 100 Taiwanese living in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF></COREF> .
Most of <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> are in <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the tourism industry</COREF> , in operations such as tourist agencies , hotels , and water sports .
Though most of the investments are small , there are large projects , including the Hotel Palau , opened * in 1998 and built * by the Kuomintang - run ACC Corporation development company , as well as a large vacation spa currently being built * by the Hung Kuo Group .
In addition , Taiwan businessman Chen Liang - shen made a major investment by *PRO* purchasing outright a local hotel .

Zero pollution
Many Taiwan business people saw the establishment of formal diplomatic relations as a green light for investment in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> .
The foreign ministry delegation that *T*-1 visited <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> in March included private sector firms involved * in tourism , textiles , electronics , and fishing , who *T*-2 went *PRO*-2 to investigate the investment environment .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese entrepreneurs already in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF></COREF> enthusiastically welcomed the establishment of an embassy there , which *T*-1 makes the future of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> investments even more secure .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="36" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lin Neng - jong</COREF> , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director - general of the Industrial Development and Investment Center of the Ministry of Economic Affairs</COREF> , who *T*-1 visited <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> in March</COREF> , points to some special concerns in the <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> investment environment : For one thing , the main islands are too rocky for agricultural development .
Moreover , the economy is not highly developed , and - except for fishing products - other materials all have *-1 to be imported *-1 .
Therefore <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> is not at an advantage in material terms .
In addition , the total population is only 18,000 .
Anyone interested in *PRO* establishing a factory there will face a labor shortage .
In fact , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> relies on " imports " for most of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> labor as well , and there are 6000 foreign workers in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> concludes : " Tourism is still the best investment in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> right now . "
Early Taiwanese investors have certainly been proved *-1 perspicacious , since <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau 's</COREF> pollution - free environment is <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> greatest asset .
Diving aficionados have hailed <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> as the greatest of the seven wonders of the deep .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> waters support more than 700 varieties of coral and 1500 varieties of fish .
The ocean water is warm and the currents are moderate , *PRO* making for ideal diving conditions .
In addition , there is a great deal of shallow water , which *T*-1 is tailor - made for snorkeling , so that even tourists who *T*-2 are not particularly at home in the water can enjoy the magnificence of the ocean .
Especially noteworthy is *T*-1 " <COREF ID="125" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Blue Corner</COREF> , " <COREF ID="125" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the most famous snorkeling locations in the world</COREF> .
And it is not only the ocean that *T*-2 is beautiful ; <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau 's</COREF> land scenery is also absorbing .
The " Rock Islands , " known * as " a garden on the sea , " have extensive white sand beaches and a rich variety of coastal plant life , as well as amazing waterfalls .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">The islands of Peleliu and Anguar , which *T*-1 were battlefields in the Pacific war between the US and Japan</COREF> , are criss - crossed *-2 by tunnels built * by the Japanese , while the remains of ships and aircraft dot the ocean floor .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">These islands</COREF> have great potential as sites for historical tourism .
In the air , because <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> is a tropical ocean climate , and <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">rains</COREF> leave as fast as <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> come *?* , tourists are often treated *-1 to rainbows .
<COREF ID="184" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Gennie Yen</COREF> , <COREF ID="184" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the director of the Taiwan office of the Palau Visitors Authority</COREF> , says that people have even seen three rainbows at one time .
And if there has been no rain , you can see a kind of horizontal rainbow by *PRO* standing on the beach at sunset and following with your eyes <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the different shades of blue of the receding ocean</COREF> as <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> merge into the bands of reds in the evening sky .
In these islands surrounded * by coral , which *T*-1 are virtually always calm and windless , you can be pulled *-2 into the sky under a parasailer , and have a whiff of what the scent of Heaven must be like *T*-3 .
In addition , <COREF ID="233" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the bia</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="233" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">traditional structures where men met *PRO*-1 to socialize and discuss local affairs *T*-2</COREF> -RRB- , and also the local species of non-poisonous jellyfish , are other items that *T*-3 are especially interesting to tourists .

*PRO* Reinvigorating the tourism market
Lin Neng - jong says 0 there are two viable directions 0 *PRO* to get into the <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> tourism industry *T*-1 .
One is *PRO* to invest in a tourism - related industry in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> , the other is *PRO* to increase the number of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> tourists and extend profit opportunities into <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> .
Oddly , despite <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau 's</COREF> beauty , in the past few years tourism has dropped off considerably .
In <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">1997</COREF> , there were more than 70,000 foreign visits to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> .
Last year the figure was 50,000 .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has been , along with Japan , one of the main sources of tourists to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">1997</COREF> , the number of Taiwanese visitors peaked at more than 30,000 annually , but now is down to well below 20,000 .
As a result , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> tourism businesses in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> , which *T*-1 mainly cater to Taiwanese , are crying uncle .
" It 's not only the hotel industry , even at Chinese restaurants business has fallen off sharply , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Chu Hui - chun</COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Chu , who *T*-1 also operates a tourist agency</COREF> , was forced *-2 *PRO*-2 to move the Chinese restaurant 0 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had run *T*-3 for many years to much smaller premises .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsu Wen - sheng</COREF> , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">deputy director - general of the ROC Tourism Bureau</COREF></COREF> , says that a major reason why profit margins have shrunk *T*-1 is that tour operators in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> no longer aggressively push <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> as a destination .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> notes that Far East Airlines , which *T*-1 operates <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> - to - <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> route</COREF> , <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">raised</COREF> the price of a ticket by over NT$ 3000 *U* two years ago , *PRO*-2 citing inadequate passenger demand and high costs .
<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> made <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> much less competitive compared to other places such as Guam , Bali , and Phuket .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> concludes : " If the price is raised *-1 for tour groups , no one is interested , but if the original price is maintained *-2 , the tour operators ' profit falls too low .
A lot of tourist agencies have simply given up *PRO*-1 promoting <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">this route</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="122" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">James Yeh</COREF> , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">general manager of the Sunrise Express Travel Service , which *T*-1 specializes in Pacific Island tours</COREF></COREF> , says that the current trend among travelers in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is for low group fares with lots of entertainment provided * .
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Most people who *T*-1 go on island vacations</COREF> are looking for pure recreation , so <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would prefer *PRO*-2 to be somewhere where the facilities are more developed *T*-3 .
Though <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> is rich in natural attractions , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> lacks peripheral tourist facilities like pubs , shopping centers , and gift shops , so naturally <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the islands</COREF> are less attractive .
Despite all this , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">James Yeh</COREF> notes that the rate of return visitors to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> is very high , more than 30 % .
Clearly <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> is still very appealing .
If <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">the problems of high group rates and inadequate facilities</COREF> can be solved *-1 , there is enormous potential yet in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> .
<COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">The Palauan government</COREF> is working hard *PRO*-1 to eliminate obstacles to *PRO* solving <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">the above problems</COREF> .
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Johnny Itaru Kishigawa</COREF> , <COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">the Palau Visitors Authority</COREF></COREF> , says that <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is going forward on a new airport and a number of tourist - related facilities .
<COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are also studying a proposal *ICH*-1 from the <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> side *PRO* to lower landing fees and reduce underlying ticket costs .
In addition , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">the PVA</COREF> now has a <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> office , and hopes *PRO*-1 to raise <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Palau 's</COREF> profile among <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> travellers .

*PRO* Gone *PRO* fishin'
In the current wave of interest in investment in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> , the fisheries industry is also getting attention .
Currently , there 's <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">only one Taiwanese business person in the fishing industry in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF></COREF> - <COREF ID="17" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tai Jung - fei</COREF></COREF> - so profits are quite good .
" At first <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was in business with <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">a bunch of friends</COREF> , and we rented eight fishing boats , but profits were only ordinary .
After <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> friends</COREF> pulled out of the operation , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> switched over to *PRO* mainly running a base for fishing boats . "
Little did <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> expect that profits would be much larger , especially after <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> acquired local fishing rights for 75 years .
During the peak season from May to October , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">more than ten tuna ships</COREF> come in every day *PRO*-1 to offload <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> catch and to resupply .
These days , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Tai 's</COREF> Palau Marine Industries</COREF> covers an area of 1.5 acres and employs more than 40 staff .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> offers advanced freezing facilities and two aircraft , *PRO*-1 guaranteeing *PRO*-1 to deliver tuna *PRO*-2 fresh to the Japanese market within 24 hours .
However , though <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Tai</COREF> has <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">made</COREF> quite a name for <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> with <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> business</COREF> , <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> does not necessarily mean that other Taiwanese can come and make similar investments .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Koo Kuang - ming</COREF> , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chairman of Koo 's Holdings Company Ltd. , which *T*-1 operates fishing boats in <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the South Pacific</COREF></COREF></COREF> , explains that <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">South Pacific</COREF> fishing is divided *-2 into <COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">two types</COREF> - <COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">net fishing</COREF> , and line fishing of tuna</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> is not really suited to <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the former</COREF> , because <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> territorial waters are not large , so the catch is limited .
On the other hand , tuna stocks there are high , so <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> is more suited to line fishing .
But the problem is that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Tai Jung - fei</COREF> is already running a tuna base there , and it *EXP*-1 is debatable whether there is the need for another one .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Koo</COREF> warns : " It *EXP*-1 's hard *PRO* to estimate the potential catch .
If there were several firms , the risk would be much greater . "
In addition , though there are many varieties of fish around <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> , the scale of operations is small , and markets are far away , so the return on investment would not necessarily be very high .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Koo</COREF> points instead to a different option : <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">The waters around <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF></COREF> are clear and warm , which *T*-1 makes <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> suited to aquaculture .
So far , returns from the small - scale aquaculture of scallops have been decent .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Koo</COREF> cautions , however , that " if you want *PRO*-1 to invest , you have *-2 to go large - scale , because after all <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> is far from the main markets . "

Palau Free Trade Zone
In 1986 , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> , like many former American - controlled trust territories , signed <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">a " Compact of Free Association</COREF> " with <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">The agreement</COREF> allows Palauan products to enter <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the States</COREF> *PRO*-1 tax - free , and there are no quota limits for such things as textiles .
For <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="20" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a major producer of textiles and electronics</COREF></COREF> , this is a very strong investment incentive .
Currently Japanese and Taiwanese business people are negotiating with <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Palauan government</COREF> *PRO*-1 to establish a Palau Free Trade Zone .
The idea is for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> to designate <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">a special zone for economic development</COREF> , with <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Palau government</COREF> providing tax and land - use incentives .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The zone</COREF> would be for processing of exports , mainly in textiles and electronics , and mainly to the US market .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="46" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Felix Yen</COREF> , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president of the Zhen An Palau Corporation</COREF> , which *T*-1 is handling the Hung Kuo project</COREF> , is very familiar with the business climate in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says that right now the main obstacles to foreign investment are land acquisition and communications .
Under Palauan law foreigners are not allowed *-1 to own land there , but can only lease land for development .
The longest permitted lease is 50 years .
But even leasing is a complicated matter , because traditionally land in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> is owned *-1 jointly by the family and the clan .
Moreover , communications and Internet access are not very reliable .
All of these problems deter investors .
Though the communications problems may be resolved *-1 within a few years - <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> has received US assistance for priority construction of electricity and fiber optic facilities - <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Neng - jong</COREF> still cautions those interested in *PRO* signing on to <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the free trade zone plan</COREF> *PRO*-2 to " be prudent . "
" The point 0 *PRO* to watch out for *T*-1 in <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the whole plan</COREF> is that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms may not understand that <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> might not be all that good a deal from the point of view of the <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> authorities , " <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
Currently foreign firms are more pro-active than <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Palauan government , which *T*-1 has <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own concerns</COREF> : The indigenous population is small , and there could be social problems if a large number of foreign workers come to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the islands</COREF> .
Also , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> must weigh economic development against environmental destruction .
" The terms under which <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Palau</COREF> would accept <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the proposed zone</COREF> *T*-1 may not be as good as many Taiwan business people optimistically expect *?* . "
