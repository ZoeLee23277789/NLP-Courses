Big Managers on Campus
In recent years , advanced education for professionals has become a hot topic in the business community .
With this trend , suddenly the mature faces of <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">managers boasting an average of over ten years of professional experience</COREF> have flooded in among the young people populating university campuses .
In order *PRO* to attract <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">this group of seasoned adults pulling in over NT$ 1 million *U* a year</COREF> back to the ivory tower , universities have begun *-1 to establish executive MBA -LRB- EMBA -RRB- programs .
In response , each year <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">over 1000 mature professionals looking *PRO* to recharge <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> minds and retool <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> know - how</COREF> compete for a precious few openings in executive degree programs at top institutions such as <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="141" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">National Taiwan University</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="141" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">NTU</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> and National Chengchi University .
What *T*-1 brings <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">these accomplished business professionals</COREF> back to the classroom ?
What knowledge *ICH*-2 do <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> seek *T*-3 that *T*-1 can not be found *-1 in society at large ?
And what effect does <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> return have *T*-1 on campus ?
<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="156" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Morris Chang</COREF> , <COREF ID="156" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chairman of TSMC and a leading light of <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> high - tech industry</COREF></COREF> , is the hottest university lecturer around .
Two years ago , <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">National Chiaotung University</COREF> invited <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="170" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang</COREF> , <COREF ID="170" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> IT sector 's most prominent success stories</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-1 to lecture to students in <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> MBA program for top managers , *PRO*-2 single - handedly raising awareness of executive MBA -LRB- EMBA -RRB- programs .
<COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">This year</COREF> , Acer Group chairman Stan Shih will be a guest lecturer at <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">the university</COREF> .
The crush of business professionals fighting for a spot in the MBA program at <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="204" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> most illustrious institution of higher education</COREF> <COREF ID="204" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">- National Taiwan University -</COREF></COREF> ensured that the acceptance rate for the executive graduate school was even lower than that for undergraduates taking the national university entrance examinations .
Various indications demonstrate that the " back flow education " promoted * by <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the Ministry of Education</COREF> has become the hottest investment undertaking among <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> universities .
Three years ago , in the effort *PRO* to establish a greater diversity of higher educational avenues , <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="232" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Ministry of Education</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="232" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">MOE</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> greatly increased the number of MA degrees open to professionals in the workforce , *PRO*-1 steadily reducing the proportion of regular students to professionals from the previous 9 - to - 1 ratio .
In addition , <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the MOE</COREF> allowed <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">universities</COREF> to determine entrance examination topics , testing dates and times , and fee structures individually *PRO* to help <COREF ID="250" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> find and obtain the best students .
*PRO*-1 Always in search of revenue sources , universities naturally fell right into line .
Twelve institutions opened programs in 1999 , with the number of executive degree programs growing to 34 as of <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> .
And as the supply has grown , <COREF ID="273" TYPE="IDENT">professionals looking *PRO* to recharge <COREF ID="273" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> intellectual batteries in disciplines ranging from Chinese , foreign languages , and physics to information technology and management</COREF> now have a greater selection from which *PRO* to choose *T*-1 .

Management white - hot
A wide range of programs is available , but popularity varies greatly .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Last year</COREF> , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">National Taiwan University of Science and Technology</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="9" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">NTUST</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> opened the doors of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">five of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> graduate schools</COREF> to professionals in the workforce .
Among <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , the Institute of Fiber planned *PRO*-1 to accept 10 students , but only 20 applied , *PRO* resulting in a 50 % acceptance rate ; meanwhile , the Institute of Mechanical Engineering had only 30 applicants for 10 spots .
Similarly , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">nine graduate institutes at <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">NTU</COREF> , including mechanical engineering , Three Principles of the People , and biology</COREF> , opened degree programs to professionals <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Expecting *PRO*-1 to accept 167 students , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> attracted a mere 330 - combined applicants .
Compared to the lukewarm popularity of other graduate programs , management institutes are white hot .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">NTUST</COREF> College of Management</COREF> attracted nearly 500 applicants with over 10 years of work experience for 20 spots in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> executive management program beginning in 1999 .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">NTU 's</COREF> College of Management</COREF> opened <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> doors to 44 professionals on a trial basis in 1996 , *PRO*-1 attracting a phenomenal 990 applicants .
When 95 spots were offered *-1 the following year *T*-2 , the number of applicants rose again to 1400 .
Currently , around a dozen public and private universities in <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , including <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">NTU</COREF> , National Chiaotung University , National Sun Yat - sen University , Da - Yeh Institute of Technology , and Yuan - Ze Institute of Technology , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel .
What is it *T*-3 that *T*-1 makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ?
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Liao Ching - jong</COREF> , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">NTUST</COREF> College of Management</COREF></COREF> , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on *PRO* accumulating professional know - how , while seasoned middle - and top - level executives seek an edge in management .
And while most recent university graduates are able *PRO*-1 to apply professional know - how upon *PRO* entering the work force , one is not necessarily taught *-2 management in the workplace .
Hence universities are the place for systematic instruction on management .
" Given the speed at which the business environment is changing *T*-1 , many new concepts were not previously taught *-2 , " says *T*-3 <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="143" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wu Se - hwa</COREF> , <COREF ID="143" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">dean of National Chengchi University 's College of Commerce</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> notes that such new fields as venture capital , technology management , intellectual property , and e-commerce are all recent additions to the curriculum over the past few years .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Tang Ming - je of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">NTU 's</COREF> College of Management</COREF></COREF> adds : " With small , medium - size and family businesses forming the backbone of Taiwanese industry , one could do just fine without professional management .
But in the age of the global village , <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">many bosses</COREF> are finding that *PRO* relying on ' instinct ' *PRO* to make business decisions is not enough , and that <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need systematic management concepts . "
Other management experts note that once <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> joins <COREF ID="ectb_1016-part-001-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the World Trade Organization</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1016-part-001-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">WTO</COREF> -RRB- , foreign universities will be able *PRO* to recruit students directly in <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and that with the Ministry of Education asking <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">national universities</COREF> *PRO*-2 to come up with a portion of <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own funding , universities are doubly motivated *PRO*-1 to establish programs of this sort .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">NTU , which *T*-1 enjoys the distinction of *PRO* being <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> premier institution of higher education</COREF> , " never lacks for students , because there are always people who *T*-2 want *PRO*-2 to attend <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">NTU</COREF> , " says *T*-3 <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Tang Ming - je</COREF> .

More than a diploma
In order *PRO* to accommodate professionals with day jobs , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">many universities</COREF> have scheduled <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> business management courses during evening hours .
The sight of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">professionals in suits and ties</COREF> rushing to class at dusk contrasts greatly from the typical jeans and casual attire of fresh - faced undergrads .
*PRO*-1 Shuttling between the office and the campus , do <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ever feel like <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're burning the candle at both ends ?
At some schools , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">even professionals boasting Ph.D. degrees</COREF> are coming back to school for Master 's degrees .
Is the degree really that important to <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Mouton Lee , in charge of over 80 employees and production of key components as president of ABBA Linear Tech Co. , Ltd.</COREF> , is a second - year student in the <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">NTUST</COREF> Graduate School of Management .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> relates that as a youth <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> studied because <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was forced *-1 *PRO*-1 to *?* , but now <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> motivations for learning are far greater - so great in fact that <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> registered for three classes at the start of the semester , a decision 0 <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has come *PRO*-2 to regret *T*-3 for lack of time .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Lee , who *T*-1 has also taken short - term management courses ,</COREF> says , " Degree programs are better , since the pressure makes you grow . "
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Mouton Lee</COREF> would like a Master 's degree , yet today <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">studies</COREF> for the knowledge 0 <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> brings *T*-1 .
Ever since *PRO* graduating with <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">a degree in mechanical engineering</COREF> from <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">NTUST</COREF> and setting out *PRO* to start <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own business over 20 years ago , <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">that degree</COREF> has sat in a drawer somewhere , *PRO* relegated * to mere symbolic significance .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsieh Sun - chi</COREF> , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of the Control Yuan 's Office of Information Management and a 25 - year veteran of civil service</COREF></COREF> , relates that <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has already attained the highest rank 0 a general civil servant can achieve *T*-1 , yet at the age of 50 <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still has over a decade until retirement .
Two years ago , this led <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 to consider *PRO*-1 taking a new direction , and <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> tested into <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">National Chengchi University 's</COREF> College of Commerce *PRO*-2 intent on *PRO* making connections with movers and shakers in different fields .
<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="148" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang Chin - tsung</COREF> , <COREF ID="148" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a researcher at the Chung - Shan Institute of Science -AMP- Technology with a Ph.D. in mechanical engineering from a US university</COREF></COREF> , shuttles between <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> office in Taoyuan s Lungtan and the <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">NTU</COREF> campus three days each week .
*PRO*-1 Long immersed *-1 in the sciences and always focusing on numbers and statistics , <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Chang</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> feels like <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> " has gotten into a mental rut . "
Although Hsinchu 's National Chiaotung University offers a similar management curriculum , <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was concerned that the students there would be science park types with similar backgrounds in high tech fields .
Thus <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would rather spend the extra time *PRO* commuting to <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">NTU</COREF> *PRO*-1 to be around students with experience in such fields as advertising , finance , and architecture .
" <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd be lying if <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">the degree</COREF> does n't matter .
If <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did n't *?* , why *PRO* not just get into a non-degree program *T*-1 ?
The truth is that <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">a degree in management</COREF> does nothing 0 *T*-1 to help <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> in <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> current job , but <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> gives <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> a second skill if <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> choose another route in the future . "
Advanced training for professionals has become a hot topic among executives over the past two years , but continuing education is nothing new among Taiwan 's universities .
For instance , <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">National Chengchi University 's</COREF> Public Administration Center has offered graduate extension courses for executives for over a decade , the difference being that , upon completion of the curriculum students only receive a certificate of course credit .
In comparison , a Master 's degree is far more appealing , *PRO* given that a degree is awarded *-1 upon completion of studies .

*PRO* Burning the proverbial candle
*PRO* Motivated * by the degree or not , the enthusiasm of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">these professionals</COREF> for <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> studies is impressive .
Nevertheless , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must pay a hefty price *PRO*-1 to be able *PRO*-1 to study in the first place .
First , *PRO* working during the day and attending classes at night is often a war of energy and will .
Next , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must shuffle <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> work schedules *PRO*-1 to accommodate <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> studies .
Many of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> have *-1 to reschedule business trips .
Meanwhile , some become highway speeders , *PRO*-1 rushing from Taoyuan or Hsinchu *PRO*-1 to attend class .
And female managers , ordinarily responsible for household chores as well , really burn the proverbial candle at both ends .
" <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> time perfectly allotted *-1 , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Morna Lee</COREF> , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Taiwan regional business manager for Kellogg 's</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> divides <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> schedule into three - month cycles , and with one class on Thursday afternoons , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> company</COREF> does <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> best *PRO*-1 to accommodate <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> by *PRO* not holding meetings that *T*-2 involve <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> on that day of the week .
Still , sometimes nothing can be done *-1 , such as the time that <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had a meeting in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> early one Friday morning , *PRO*-2 forcing <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> *PRO*-4 to miss class on Thursday while <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> flew to <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> had *-1 to fly quickly back to Taipei *PRO*-1 to make class on Saturday afternoon .
Despite *PRO* often staying up until 2:00 or 3:00 AM *PRO* to study or write reports , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> likes *PRO*-2 mingling in <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the executive management class</COREF> with a diverse group of students from different fields , and feels that the new ideas 0 the professors feed <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-3 help *PRO*-4 keep <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> brain *PRO*-5 supple .

Female professionals like <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Morna Lee</COREF> represent a minority among executive degree students , *PRO*-1 accounting for just about five percent .
" If you asked <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> whether work or family is more important , <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say that since *PRO* entering society 20 years ago work has always come first , " states *T*-1 <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Donna Sun</COREF> , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">vice president of the Human Resource Division at Schmidt Scientific Taiwan</COREF></COREF> .
Even if <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> has no classes 0 *PRO* to attend *T*-1 , *PRO* leaving the office at 8:00 PM is no different *ICH*-3 from the perspective of <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> family life than the extra hour 0 <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> spends *T*-2 *PRO* attending classes until 9:00 PM .

No magic bullet
Compared to young students focused * on *PRO* getting a degree , the motivations of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">professionals studying for advanced degrees</COREF> " are not that simple . "
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> might be after new knowledge , keen *PRO*-1 to sport a fancy degree from a graduate school like <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">NTU</COREF> or <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Chengchi University</COREF> , out *PRO* to network with others , or looking out for the survival of business and *PRO*-1 to raise competitiveness by *PRO* searching for answers to difficult work or business issues .

By the 1990s , accumulation of know - how accelerated many times over , so that executives needed *-1 to learn something new each day .

<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="115" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tom Lin</COREF> , <COREF ID="115" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">associate professor of marketing at <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">NTUST</COREF></COREF></COREF> , describes the main difference between *PRO* teaching adult executives and regular students :
" <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Executives</COREF> are always asking questions .
Even when <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have an idea <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> *T*-4 , <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll still bring up issues 0 <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> encountered *T*-1 in <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> jobs *PRO*-2 to see how you respond *T*-3 . "
Often , says *?* <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> , such questions leave <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 stumped .
Another issue for <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">adult students always on the run</COREF> is <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> unfamiliarity with the campus .
In order *PRO* to enhance <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sense of identification with the school , <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">NTUST</COREF> designed an overseas business camp program .
Last year , one professor made a big hit with <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">over 30 students</COREF> , *PRO*-1 taking <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to mainland China for over ten days *PRO*-1 to familiarize <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> with the investment environment there .
This year , trips *ICH*-2 are planned *-1 to Japan and Silicon Valley in the United States .

*PRO* Planting in fertile soil
*PRO* Judging from the manner in which <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">universities</COREF> are opening <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> doors for continuing education , non-degree programs , and professional training *T*-1 , higher education in Taiwan appears *-2 to be undergoing a sort of makeover .
With these changes , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">universities</COREF> must not only take care of teaching and research , but must also make *PRO*-1 sure 0 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> play <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> third function *ICH*-2 properly - *PRO* spreading <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">knowledge</COREF> and sharing <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with the public .
Still , detractors point out that university graduate programs for business executives appear *-1 to be elitist .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">One student attending a non-degree program at <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">NTUST</COREF></COREF> relates that there are not enough spots *PRO* to go around in the executive degree programs .
*PRO*-1 Hoping *PRO*-1 to make the switch from the non-degree program , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> failed *-1 to pass the screening that *T*-2 is administered *-2 prior to the admissions test .
" If you fail a test , you only have yourself 0 *PRO* to blame *T*-1 , but *PRO* tripping up on the initial screening is just a matter of *PRO* not having a high enough job title . "
Each year when EMBA program acceptances are released *-1 *T*-2 , newspapers carry letters from readers relating how certain national university graduate schools compete *PRO*-3 to accept CEOs and presidents of listed corporations , or the children of rich business people *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">NTUST</COREF> student</COREF> expresses cynicism toward the application and review process , *PRO*-1 suspecting that " they just pay attention to company name and job title . "
Moreover , continuing education courses charge hefty tuition fees .
For instance , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">NTU</COREF> divides the school year into three semesters , at NT$ 50,000 *U* per semester , while other institutions charge between NT$ 3700 and $ 10,000 *U* per credit , a full two to three times more than regular graduate student tuition .
Such instances naturally lead to suspicion that graduate schools such as these are " out *PRO* to make a killing " by *PRO* catering only to an elite few .
" From review , to written test , to oral exam , in order *PRO* to ensure fairness , no professor is involved *-1 in more than one portion of the process , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Huang Chung - hsing</COREF> , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of the EMBA program at <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">NTU</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
Still , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">Huang</COREF> admits that *PRO* the bigger 0 the company *?* *T*-1 and higher 0 <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the candidate 's</COREF> job title *?* *T*-2 , the greater <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> chances of acceptance into the program *?* *T* .
This can be partially attributed *-1 to the belief *ICH*-2 among <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">professors</COREF> that the commitment of <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> educational resources yields " more bang for the buck . "
As Tang Ming - je forthrightly explains , <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">university professors '</COREF> time is a national resource , and if <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can have a positive impact on an executive controlling budgets of billions of NT dollars , <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> contribution to country and society is considerable .
Asks <COREF ID="174" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Liao Ching - jong</COREF> , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of the <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">NTUST</COREF> Graduate School of Management</COREF> , concurs , " Which *ICH*-1 *T*-2 is greater , the marginal benefit of a company president or a staff member 's education ?
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">The president</COREF> can go back and put what <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> learns *T*-1 into practice right away . "
What *T*-1 is more , even if schools do not deliberately seek out <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">company presidents</COREF> , <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> invariably perform better on oral exams - perhaps due to <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> greater experience .
" We must ask ourselves some questions , too , when EMBAs are thought of *-1 as *PRO* giving away degrees to the privileged few *T*-2 , " comments *T*-3 <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Se - Hwa</COREF> .
<COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> tells <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> professors</COREF> that unless <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> perform well in class , the EMBA can not develop further , as universities are founded *-1 upon academic research .
As for tuition policies , <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Se - Hwa</COREF> relates that with an annual budget of NT$ 2.1 billion *U* , National Chengchi University spends about NT$ 200,000 *U* per student .
Thus , when it comes down to *PRO* calculating costs *T*-1 , NT$ 10,000 per credit is actually quite cheap .

Industry retooling
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The EMBA craze</COREF> reflects the cold , intense competition of social Darwinism , but does <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> also signify that Taiwanese industry is beginning *-1 to devote greater attention to the training of top executives ?
Many scholars believe that with <COREF ID="ectb_1016.part-007-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the EMBA phenomenon</COREF> just getting off <COREF ID="ectb_1016.part-007-E1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> feet in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , many corporate bosses are <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">taking</COREF> a " wait - and - see " attitude .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is reflected *-1 in the way 0 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">students</COREF> approach the programs *T*-2 , *PRO* not informing <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bosses that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have applied to a program until <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have been accepted *-3 , and not occupying work time if school takes place in the evening .
This way , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> boss 's attitude has no particular bearing on what <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do *T*-1 .
Perhaps business education may not be widespread in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> at this time , yet <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">a small number of company bosses</COREF> have taken the lead <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> - *PRO*-2 taking advanced courses and setting an example for management personnel .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="55" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ma Yu - shan</COREF> , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chairman of <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Kingdom Construction</COREF></COREF> and 64 years old this year</COREF> , tested into <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">NTU 's</COREF> College of Management in 1998 , *PRO*-1 becoming <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">NTU 's</COREF> oldest student .
For <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Ma</COREF> , " *PRO* living and learning " is more than just a maxim , as each year <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Kingdom Construction</COREF> employees are required *-1 *PRO*-1 to undergo 80 hours of on - the - job training .
" For <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the boss</COREF> to lead <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> team , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> ca n't just tell <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> subordinates *PRO*-1 to learn , while <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> remains static <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> .
*PRO* Not to mention that in discussions with <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">employees</COREF> , if <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know 0 you 're <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the kind of boss who *T*-2 does n't seek *PRO*-2 to further <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> put less stock in what you say *T*-3 , " notes *T*-1 <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Ma</COREF> .
With the rapid changes in the business environment , poor decision - making can have serious consequences for company development .
" The pressure on the boss is tremendous , because nobody comes to the CEO with easy questions . "
*PRO*-1 Too busy *PRO*-1 to attend regular courses , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Ma Yu - shan</COREF> took the advice of an <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">NTU</COREF> professor and hired a Ph.D. student *PRO*-2 to tutor <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> one semester in " management economics . "
<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Amber Huang</COREF> , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president of Changhua 's Feng Huei Steel -AMP- Iron Company</COREF></COREF> , is a student in the Department of Business Administration at NTUST .
<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">Huang</COREF> notes three advantages of <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the boss</COREF> <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">going</COREF> to school .
First , <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's good for <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> company 's image .
As <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> company must frequently seek bank loans , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">Huang</COREF> asks rhetorically , " Could a studious boss be a bad guy ? "
This image has helped <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> secure loans with little difficulty every time .
Second , <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> sets a good example for employees .
Lastly , *PRO* speaking the professional lingo fluently helps *PRO*-1 enhance <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> authority .

Knowledge for the new century
In the effort *PRO* to cultivate management talent , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">many prominent multinational corporations</COREF> have founded <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own teaching institutions , Toyota University and Intel University being two good examples .
In <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the Acer Group 's</COREF> Aspire Academy</COREF> opened <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> doors in Lungtan -LRB- Taoyuan Country -RRB- last October after three years of planning .

<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Shih</COREF> noted that through the sharing of experiences , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">emerging businesses</COREF> might save <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> a lot of *PRO* groping in the dark .
Are people at the fin de siecle inspired *-1 *PRO*-1 to learn by the confluence of technology , humanities , and economic knowledge ?
At least the entrepreneurs , managers , and executives in campuses around <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> clearly recognize that learning is a necessity for survival and an engine of growth .
