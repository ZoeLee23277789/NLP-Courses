The Age of the Peacock
" God gives <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">a woman</COREF> one face ; <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> can make another one for <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> . "
This well - known expression is being amended *-1 by the behavior of men in the 21st century .
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">The " male beauty pageant " at Chiao Tung University</COREF> just ended , and <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was quickly followed *-1 by a website male beauty contest .
<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Modern males</COREF> not only are competing over looks , <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> also are competing over *PRO* dressing <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> up and making <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> over .
In <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> book The Art of Life , <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">the humorist Lin Yutang</COREF> noted how " commercial advertising has commodified virtually every inch of a woman 's body , right down to the last line and the last painted toenail *T*-1 . "
Now when you look at advertising billboards or magazines *T*-1 , you see <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">men displaying <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> oiled - up muscles , shiny white teeth , smooth and clean - shaven skin , and elegant attire</COREF> .
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">The " new man "</COREF> is making <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> over from head to toe , and is not averse to *PRO* showing a more feminine side in *PRO* doing so .
Men are invading territory previously held * exclusively by women , and are declaring : " <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">Ladies</COREF> , <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> no longer have a monopoly on *PRO* making <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">yourselves</COREF> beautiful ! "

" *PRO* This summer , before *PRO* putting on your shorts and sandals , be sure * to do skin care treatment and thoroughly clean your legs , so that you can present a fresh clean image to people . "
You would probably assume that this is an ad for a woman 's beauty product , would n't you *?* ?
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">A men 's fashion magazine that *T*-1 sells over 10,000 copies per month in convenience stores</COREF> cautions <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> male readers</COREF> that if <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-2 to have the " face of an angel , " then every day <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must do " three - step skin care " *PRO*-3 to rid <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> of dead skin cells .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Men</COREF> can now retain <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> youthful looks with moisturizing masks , wrinkle - removing patches , and techniques for *PRO* tightening facial skin and giving the lines of the face a more pronounced depth .
*PRO* Of course , after facial care is finished *-1 , do n't forget *PRO* to rub moisturizing cream into your calves !
Everywhere <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">advertisements</COREF> are promoting the idea of the " peacock . "
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are encouraging <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">modern men</COREF> *PRO*-1 to take practical steps *PRO*-1 to " decorate " <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .

Last year , some of the leading brands showed sales increases of 200 % .
Many male clients have three or four different kinds of fragrance at home , *PRO*-1 using different ones for the office , long weekends , and so on .
In days gone * by , it *EXP*-2 was considered *-1 an extravagance for Dad to go down to the barbershop for a shave and haircut .
Today beauty parlors are offering <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">these aging gents</COREF> the chance *PRO* to lighten <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> spots , change <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> profiles , and have <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> wrinkles pulled *-1 away .

It *EXP*-1 is frequently argued *-4 that it is a male - dominated society that *T*-2 creates the need for <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">women</COREF> to spend money *PRO*-3 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">making</COREF> <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> up as if <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives depended on <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
But who should *T*-1 get the " credit " for this new male infatuation with beauty ?
Besides the fact that advertising and sales pitches in a modern commercial society " seduce " some men into *PRO* falling into the beauty trap , many observers suggest that a major force behind male vanity are women , especially the women closest to individual men .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Betty Wu</COREF> , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a famous author and television host</COREF></COREF> , says that today <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">seven out of ten modern guys who *T*-1 buy name - brand fashions and use cosmetics</COREF> do so under the influence of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> girlfriends .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> has found that " modern men can in fact easily accept change . "
Indeed , as consumers <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">men</COREF> are often easier *PRO* to deal with *?* than women , as <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are more decisive about *PRO* purchasing .
When <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was a primarily agricultural , then primarily industrial , society *T*-1 , most men lived off physical labor .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Few</COREF> bothered *PRO*-1 to worry about <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> external appearance .
Even office workers dressed the same every day for years on end .
Of course , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">rich kids</COREF> had the ability *PRO* to dress up , but <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were generally seen *-1 as playboys or dandies .
But women have had enough of that , and these days have the economic wherewithal 0 *PRO* to do something about it *T*-1 .
In the past , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">women</COREF> could only be recipients of gifts from men , but now <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are able *PRO* to buy gifts 0 *PRO* to give *T*-1 to <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> male partners .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Women</COREF> are very familiar with the cosmetics market , and are now influencing the consumer behavior of <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> husbands and boyfriends .
With a little help from women , men 's fashions have taken off :
" Virtually all the major men 's fashion brands have been brought *-1 into <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> in the last five years , " say *T*-2 <COREF ID="125" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Justin Lin</COREF> , <COREF ID="125" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">editor - in - chief of <COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Men 's Uno</COREF> , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a well - known fashion magazine</COREF></COREF> .
In the past , when foreign companies would release men 's and women 's fashion lines at the same time *T*-1 , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> importers would only bring in the women 's clothing ; now men 's and women 's attire comes in together .
Men also are increasingly feeling *PRO*-1 pushed *-1 by women in the realm of cosmetic surgery and body shaping .
<COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">Many men</COREF> have been encouraged *-1 by <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> wives *PRO*-1 to get surgery *PRO* to change <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> single-fold eyelids to double-fold , or to have fat removed *-2 by liposuction .
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">One mother</COREF> brought <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> middle school son</COREF> to Lin Ching - yun 's cosmetic surgery hospital , *PRO*-1 saying : " <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could n't give birth to a good nose for <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , but at least <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can have a good nose made *-2 for <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .

Macho macho man
In the view of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Betty Wu</COREF> , the reason men are daring *PRO*-1 to enter the ranks of beauty lovers , and even accept softer and more feminine standards of beauty , is because expectations of men in society have changed .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The women of Generation X , born * after 1965</COREF> , have economic independence , and no longer are looking to men *PRO* to support <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children .
Thus <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> no longer are looking for someone who " *T*-1 walks and talks like a real man . "
In the past , the definition of " a real man " was usually one who *T*-1 could support a wife and children , and who *T*-2 would play the active role in a relationship , with the woman being the passive partner .
Since <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">more and more women</COREF> do not expect a man to support <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , what <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are looking for *T*-1 in a man has also changed .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> croons , " We want men to be more juicy . "
In the past it was no big deal if your male partner was n't really presentable , but now an important condition for <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">a boyfriend</COREF> is that one is not embarrassed *PRO*-1 to take <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> out in public .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> : " <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just do n't understand what <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> mother saw *T*-2 in <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">John Wayne</COREF> in <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> dirty old jeans .
" In the past <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">women</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to be coddled *-1 , now <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-2 to coddle men .
Guys who *T*-1 evoke a woman 's sympathetic instincts and " non-threatening " types of " pretty boys " are becoming more and more popular .
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lucia Lee</COREF> , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a young office worker who *T*-1 regularly discusses social trends with webfriends on <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> own website</COREF></COREF> , says that modern males no longer have that rough - tough character ; guys like Hsieh Ting - feng and Chen Hsiao - tung , who *T*-2 never have a hair out of place , are very popular male idols these days .
When <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">well - groomed male stars</COREF> stand on stage next to <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> female counterparts *T*-1 , they both look equally " juicy . "

*PRO* Relax dudes
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Social change</COREF> is permitting women *PRO*-2 to devote more attention to *PRO* admiring male beauty , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> also is allowing <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">men</COREF> to enjoy *PRO*-1 beautifying <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ning Yin - bin</COREF> , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an associate professor in the Graduate Institute of Philosophy at National Central University , and an expert on gender issues ,</COREF> says that for a long time " society did not encourage <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">men</COREF> *PRO*-1 to spend time *PRO* making <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> up or becoming more attractive to others . "
The role 0 society assigned *T*-1 to men emphasized accomplishments in the outside world , so it *EXP*-2 was only legitimate for men to learn how *PRO* to make a living *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wang Hao - wei</COREF> , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a psychiatrist who *T*-1 frequently writes on the subject of men in Taiwan</COREF> , says that <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">guys</COREF> by nature find it *EXP*-2 hard *PRO* to reveal <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> softer sides .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> can only put down <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> body armor after *PRO* slugging a few drinks down .
Today , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're getting a chance *PRO* to express <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> through external beauty , and can show a softer side .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">He Tu - lin</COREF> , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a tall and handsome television star</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">declared</COREF> <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own opinion - without the least bashfulness about <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> - on a recent radio program :
" The key factor allowing <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">men</COREF> to have the courage 0 *PRO* to display <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own bodies *T*-1 is that <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> see <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bodies as <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> bodies no longer belong to a cultural tradition or to other people .
As <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">men</COREF> <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">love</COREF> <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> more , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can transfer some of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">this self - love</COREF> to <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bodies .
As a result , <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">modern men</COREF> have discovered that can <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can make a statement about <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> through <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> clothes and <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bodies . "
Whether *PRO* awakened * to a new sense of <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own bodies by popular culture , or driven *PRO* to stay at the forefront of commercial fashion , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">contemporary men</COREF> have certainly made a firm decision *PRO* to make <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> more beautiful .
Moreover , as the service industry has come *PRO*-1 to dominate the economy , a fresh and clean appearance - with absolutely none of that macho sweat thing allowed * - has become *PRO* considered simply *PRO* good manners .
<COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Many of the young men 0 one might consider *T*-1 " vain "</COREF> say that <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> only bother *PRO*-2 to create an immaculate external appearance because <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need *-3 to look sharp for <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> jobs .
Yet , *PRO* simply not smelling * repulsive is hardly enough *PRO* to satisfy <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">these men</COREF> .
A case in point :
Last year , <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">Singtsufang Enterprise</COREF> imported specially made underwear from Japan that *T*-1 gives a guy that " tight butt " look .
<COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> originally anticipated that <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the stock</COREF> would sell out only by October , but in fact <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> went six months earlier .
Kao -LRB- Taiwan -RRB- Corporation recently did a " millennial masculinity survey " in which <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">70 % of male respondents</COREF> said that <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could accept the idea of a man wearing cosmetics *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Many foreign manufacturers and advertisers</COREF> are rubbing <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hands in gleeful anticipation of *PRO* getting a share of this market .
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen Yen - ying</COREF> , <COREF ID="189" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of public relations planning for Kao</COREF> , says that this year at least four companies will begin *-1 marketing skin care products for men .
From the celebrity advertisements in subway stations and on the sides of buses , you can see that in terms of market leaders like trendy fashions , hair styling , body sculpting , face care , and even undergarments , there is a tremendous amount of scope for a more diversified selection of products for men .

Androgynous zone
Ideally , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">businesses and popular culture</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to be able *PRO* to sweep everyone up in a single net , and would prefer *PRO* not to break <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> market up by gender .
It *EXP*-1 happens that many modern guys who *T*-2 go in for *PRO* dressing up are also showing a trend toward androgynous standards of beauty .
In fact , says *?* <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Betty Wu</COREF> , it is not only now that androgynous standards of beauty are starting *-4 to take root in <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
Although everyone has a different aesthetic sense , and there are many kinds of beauty , " you can still identify certain trends , " <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says *T*-1 .
" Some years the look is the tough , hard - nosed type , and other years a softer , more feminine look is in . "
*PRO* Look at <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">some of the stars of early films in <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , like Chin Han , Chin Hsiang - lin , and Liu Wen - zheng , who *T*-1 had a definite elegance</COREF> .
" <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were tall and well - built , but very gentle , " opines *T*-1 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> .
These days , more and more women , in *PRO* appreciating men , think that *PRO* the " prettier " 0 the guys are *?* , the better .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Justin Lin</COREF> , in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> analysis of the pretty - boy phenomenon , avers : In the 1990s , the general trend of all cutting - edge design was " super-youth . "
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Many well - established products appealing to the upper middle - class</COREF> found it *EXP*-1 impossible *PRO* to resist <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the trend toward youth</COREF> and had *-2 to change <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own design and style .
*PRO*-1 Looking around , you can see a transition in the most popular types of male models .
The muscle man and the James Dean type are on the way out .
More and more the models are of the soft , almost feminine schoolboy type , the boy next - door type , or <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">boys who *T*-1 look childish and underdeveloped , as if <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> lack experience</COREF> .
You could say that people just got tired of *PRO* looking at macho men and cool dudes .
But as <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Hao - wei</COREF> sees it , the deeper cause of the current worship of ever - greater youthfulness in modern society can be traced *-1 to the dissolution of the traditional family structure .
Elders , who *T*-1 held all the power in the past , have become targets of derision .
Businesses have no choice but *PRO* to go along with <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the trend</COREF> .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> concludes : " In a society in which individualism is important *T*-1 , youth is the best security . "
Besides *PRO* adapting to rising individualism , ever - alert commercial culture is also taking advantage of feminism and homosexual self - awareness .
Cross-gender thinking is <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">influencing</COREF> the way 0 <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">men</COREF> make <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> appear *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is especially apparent in <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the entertainment community , which *T*-1 sets the pace for popular culture and is often the fastest 0 *T*-2 to pick up on new trends</COREF> .
Many in <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">that field</COREF> are crossing traditional barriers between male and female .
In the past <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">only women</COREF> had <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">sequins , embroidery , or skin - revealing gaps</COREF> as part of <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> clothing , but now <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are being put *-1 in men 's clothing as well .
Recently , the top four Hong Kong male singing stars were seen *-1 on stage *PRO*-1 competing for attention while *PRO* wearing skirts .
You can expect that it *EXP*-1 wo n't be long before you can admire some guy on the street wearing a skirt .
The new generation of young women mostly have a positive attitude toward androgynous beauty .
As <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">Lucia Lee</COREF> says , " raw masculinity or raw femininity is of course attractive , but *PRO* the more diversified 0 is the pursuit of beauty *?* , the more interesting the world is *T*-1 .
As far as <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm concerned *-1 , if a guy wants *PRO*-2 to wear a skirt or have long hair , as long as it looks good , anything goes . "

Though <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has already entered the working world , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still pays close attention to the men 's fashions introduced * into magazines .

<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Ta - wei</COREF> also has <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own ideas about the skin care products on the market :
" <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">Men 's skin care products all</COREF> assume that men have oily skin with built up dead skin cells , so <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">very strong cleaning agents</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> can damage your skin .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> prefer *PRO*-1 to use softer women 's skin tonic . "

<COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says that if <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is the last of the " a - man 's - life - is - hard " generation , <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> younger brother</COREF> will unfortunately <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> of a set whose lives *T*-1 will be even harder down the road .
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is because <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> younger brother , who *T*-1 invests an hour a day *PRO* decking <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> out</COREF> , spends virtually all <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> money on clothing and pleasure .

The materials of the clothes and the hairstyle have *-1 to be just right .

Beauty is an acquired trait
Some feel that the arrival of " the age of the peacock " is simply a reflection of the frivolousness of the younger generation .
Public commentary was quite reserved on the incident of " Chiao Tung University has no handsome guys " and the subsequent " male beauty pageant " earlier this year .
But , counters *?* <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen Tsai - ching</COREF> , <COREF ID="22" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of guidance counseling at the Lungshan Middle School</COREF></COREF> , it *EXP*-1 is in the nature of <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">young people</COREF> in whatever era *PRO* to worry about <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> looks .
As <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> sees it , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">young people</COREF> are no more vain *ICH*-1 now than <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were *?* in the past .
It 's just that society is more open , and <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">adults</COREF> are more tolerant .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> no longer have a negative , repressive attitude , and therefore <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">young people</COREF> are more daring about *PRO* expressing <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ko Ching - ming</COREF> , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a professor of Chinese at <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">National Taiwan University</COREF> who *T*-1 is in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fifties</COREF></COREF> , says , " <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> grew up with compulsory haircuts and school uniforms . "
In the past , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">both boys and girls</COREF> were required *-1 *PRO*-1 to keep <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> external appearance *PRO*-2 " non-provocative . "
The new generation has more opportunities *PRO* to express individuality through appearance .
In the youth sub-culture that *T*-1 aims for rebelliousness , dyed hair and pierced ears have become trademarks .
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Ko</COREF> sees <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> simply as the diversified choice that *T*-1 is available in a pluralistic society .
" There 's no need *PRO* to see <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as an indicator of morality . "
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chang Shao - yu</COREF> , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a second year medical student at <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">National Taiwan University</COREF></COREF></COREF> , says that in fact beauty is learned *-1 .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Some of <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> classmates</COREF> are able *PRO* to achieve a certain look without *PRO* really investing too much effort simply because <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> parents devoted a lot of attention to clothes .
" <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">The kids from <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> family</COREF> , on the other hand , have *-1 to figure it out for <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">ourselves</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> voice carries a tinge of regret .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> and <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother rarely went *PRO*-1 shopping together or discussed how *PRO* to evaluate the quality of clothes *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Chang , who *T*-1 takes note of how others dress *T*-2 and of how fashions are matched *-3 in store displays *T*-4</COREF> , says that the point is not for <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">parents</COREF> to teach <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children</COREF> *PRO*-5 to be slaves to fashion , but *NOT* *PRO* to teach <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> how *PRO* to dress with a sense of character and beauty *T*-8 .
Whether or not you find <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">this behavior among some men</COREF> acceptable , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is an established fact .
<COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="157" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tsai Shih - ping</COREF> , <COREF ID="157" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a " pretty boy " from the literary world who *T*-1 is now <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> 40s</COREF></COREF> , sighs : " This is a new era , and <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">men</COREF> really can make a statement with <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bodies .

*PRO* Dress for success ?
There is more at work here *ICH*-1 , however , than *PRO* just looking good , and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">many men</COREF> now feel , as many women have long felt , that *PRO* dressing up is forced *-2 on <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> by society .
Wang Hao - wei notes that in this generation people are increasingly forced *-1 into situations in which appearance matters *T*-2 - for example , on the lecture podium , or in front of the TV camera or the camera lens .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> need a greater sense of self - confidence , and feel more and more uncomfortable with <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bodies .
So <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> strive more and more *PRO*-1 to recover lost confidence by *PRO* enhancing <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> external appearance .
" If you do n't have looks , and you ca n't dress well , you wo n't even be able *PRO*-1 to find a job as a clerk in a clothing store , which *T*-2 is ranked *-2 as one of the lowest status job categories , " says *T*-3 Chen Ta - wei .
*PRO* Go to a clothing store and check it out for yourself -
you wo n't find any ugly guys working there .
In fact , there is still a lot of discrimination in our society based * on appearance .
It is not only the young who *T*-1 want *PRO*-1 to look better , and it seems 0 the attitudes of <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the kids</COREF> are affecting <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> elders at home .
Besides *PRO* supporting <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> families , <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">guys in their 40s</COREF> are also starting *-1 to worry about whether <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are looking old , and whether <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> beer - guts are starting *-2 to show .
So <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> too are joining the ranks of those seeking cosmetic surgery and skin care treatments .
Men 's Uno had one article which *T*-1 said : In the past , <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Western guys</COREF> lived for sun , sea , and sex .
These days , <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think about how the sun causes skin cancer , the sea is filled *-1 with oil spills , and sex can be fatal *T*-2 .
Thus a beautiful body , appropriate diet , and healthy recreation have become the new pursuits .
Part of the reason 0 middle - aged men seek better looks *T*-1 is also health , with health now encompassing the realm of skin care and looks as well .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Ning Yin - bin</COREF> suggests that it *EXP*-1 is hard *PRO* to generalize about which group or groups *T*-2 are in the " beauty - loving set . "
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> points to the fact that even politicians are playing this game .
In this visual age , politics is closely tied *-1 in with performance .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Male politicians</COREF> are careful about <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> appearance and attire .
With the help of male beauty salons , skin care products , and cosmetic surgery , <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">these middle - aged men</COREF> can also win the support of strangers just from <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> external appearance .
<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Ching - yun , who *T*-1 often helps <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">politicians</COREF> with <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> images</COREF> , says frankly that <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">many politicos</COREF> come *PRO*-2 to have <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> wrinkles and the bags under <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> eyes removed *-3 before <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> go for photo sessions .
And many government officials who *T*-1 often appear on TV have been patients in <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> cosmetic surgery clinic .
<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">The book , Dear , I Want You to Look *-2 Good For Me</COREF> is billing <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> as " the first book of sartorial philosophy against which men can measure themselves *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">The book</COREF> declares that as Taiwan moves toward internationalization , men are constantly required *-1 *PRO*-1 to appear in public places or at social gatherings , so that *PRO* dressing up is no longer a monopoly of women .

Playboys , not chauvinists
The rapidity with which ideas and fads spread in a wealthy information society *T*-1 means that a love of beauty is not limited *-2 to one gender , and body - sculpting does not distinguish between young and old .
Last year , a survey by <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Tung 's Foundation</COREF> discovered that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the gender / age cohort most concerned about comparisons between <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bodies and others '</COREF> is <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">men aged * 60 and above</COREF> .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> ranked *PRO*-2 higher than women or any other age group of men on " willingness *PRO* to pay money *PRO* to preserve or enhance physique " and " attention devoted * to changes in physique . "
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The Foundation 's</COREF> suggested explanation is that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">these men</COREF> were focused *-1 on <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> careers when <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were younger *T*-2 , and <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are only turning <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> attention to <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> appearance as <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get older .
The new generation , on the other hand , <COREF ID="ectb_1018-part-009-E1" TYPE="IDENT">strikes</COREF> a balance between career and appearance .
<COREF ID="ectb_1018-part-009-E1" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not necessarily a bad thing .
In the eyes of feminists , the arrival of the era of male preening has added a number of interesting possibilities to the game of mutual admiration between the sexes .
But besides lustful appreciation there is a deeper question :
Do <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the " peacocks " who *T*-1 have been influenced *-1 in part by feminist consciousness</COREF> " have any different ideas or make any adjustments with regard to <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> roles in relations between the sexes ? "
Not necessarily , it appears .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">He Tu - lin</COREF> , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a staunch advocate of male body autonomy</COREF> , did an advertisement once for jewelry for men .
Beneath the soft face was *T*-1 a body of primitive , raw male muscle , with the idea being that jewelry makes a man even sexier .
The ad copy claimed that jewelry would attract <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">women</COREF> and make <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> " willing *PRO* to accept your rules . "
Wang Hao - wei has asked <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">flashy " pretty boys "</COREF> how <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> cope if <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> girlfriends wo n't listen to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-1 .
Often the case is , " I give her a good slap in the face . "
Despite such anecdotal evidence , however , there are hopes that there will be positives from the new male fashion sense .
Ning Yin - bin assumes that as men and women compete in corporeal beauty , some balance will be reached *-1 , without *PRO* going to extremes .
<COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Ching - yun , who *T*-1 has often expressed in writing <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> conviction that <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> should n't go for cosmetic surgery unless <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have little choice</COREF> , says that the advantage of men entering the ranks of cosmetic surgery patients is that there is more supervision of the industry ; women who *T*-2 go for plastic surgery *PRO* accompanied * by husbands or boyfriends usually get better results .
Liu Hsiang , who *T*-1 spends a lot of time *PRO* dressing and making up , has come *PRO*-2 to feel deeply the trouble 0 <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">women</COREF> go through *T*-3 in <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> pursuit of beauty .
Perhaps , when more men can feel the sentiment that women have known *T*-3 for millennia of " *PRO* dressing up *PRO* to please others *T*-2 , " gender relations will be a little more harmonious .
