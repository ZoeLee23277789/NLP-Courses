    The MND argues that since the military is being streamlined, in order to concentrate defense forces in Taiwan, Penghu,
    Kinmen, and Matsu, the defense of the Pratas and Spratley islands-which are in the South China Sea-and the protection of
    coastal fishing vessels and coastal security should be left to the Coast Guard.

    If the PRC were to launch 200-300 guided missiles against Taiwan, although the damage to industry, power, and
    communications would probably not be as serious as was caused by the September 21 earthquake, citizens are not
    psychologically prepared for war, and the economy might not be able to withstand the assault.
