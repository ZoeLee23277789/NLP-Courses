Big Managers on Campus
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , advanced education for professionals has become a hot topic in the business community .
With this trend , suddenly the mature faces of managers boasting an average of over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten years</ENAMEX> of professional experience have flooded in among the young people populating university campuses .
In order to attract this group of seasoned adults pulling in over <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 1 million</ENAMEX> a year back to the ivory tower , universities have begun to establish executive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MBA</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EMBA</ENAMEX> -RRB- programs .
In response , each year over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1000</ENAMEX> mature professionals looking to recharge their minds and retool their know - how compete for a precious few openings in executive degree programs at top institutions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University</ENAMEX> .
What brings these accomplished business professionals back to the classroom ?
What knowledge do they seek that can not be found in society at large ?
And what effect does their return have on campus ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morris Chang</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TSMC</ENAMEX> and a leading light of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's high - tech industry , is the hottest university lecturer around .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years ago</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chiaotung University</ENAMEX> invited <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> IT sector 's most prominent success stories , to lecture to students in its <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MBA</ENAMEX> program for top managers , single - handedly raising awareness of executive <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MBA</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EMBA</ENAMEX> -RRB- programs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Acer Group</ENAMEX> chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Shih</ENAMEX> will be a guest lecturer at the university .
The crush of business professionals fighting for a spot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MBA</ENAMEX> program at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's most illustrious institution of higher education <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">- National Taiwan University -</ENAMEX> ensured that the acceptance rate for the executive graduate school was even lower than that for undergraduates taking the national university entrance examinations .
Various indications demonstrate that the " back flow education " promoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> has become the hottest investment undertaking among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's universities .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years ago</ENAMEX> , in the effort to establish a greater diversity of higher educational avenues , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MOE</ENAMEX> -RRB- greatly increased the number of <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">MA</ENAMEX> degrees open to professionals in the workforce , steadily reducing the proportion of regular students to professionals from the previous <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9</ENAMEX> - to - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> ratio .
In addition , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">MOE</ENAMEX> allowed universities to determine entrance examination topics , testing dates and times , and fee structures individually to help them find and obtain the best students .
Always in search of revenue sources , universities naturally fell right into line .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Twelve</ENAMEX> institutions opened programs in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> , with the number of executive degree programs growing to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">34</ENAMEX> as of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
And as the supply has grown , professionals looking to recharge their intellectual batteries in disciplines ranging from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> , foreign languages , and physics to information technology and management now have a greater selection from which to choose .
Management white - hot
A wide range of programs is available , but popularity varies greatly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University of Science and Technology</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> -RRB- opened the doors of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> of its graduate schools to professionals in the workforce .
Among them , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of Fiber</ENAMEX> planned to accept <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> students , but only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> applied , resulting in a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> acceptance rate ; meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Institute of Mechanical Engineering</ENAMEX> had only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> applicants for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> spots .
Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> graduate institutes at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> , including mechanical engineering , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> Principles of the People , and biology , opened degree programs to professionals <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Expecting to accept <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">167</ENAMEX> students , they attracted a mere <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">330</ENAMEX> - combined applicants .
Compared to the lukewarm popularity of other graduate programs , management institutes are white hot .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">College of Management</ENAMEX> attracted nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> applicants with over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years</ENAMEX> of work experience for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> spots in its executive management program beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1999</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">College of Management</ENAMEX> opened its doors to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">44</ENAMEX> professionals on a trial basis in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</ENAMEX> , attracting a phenomenal <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">990</ENAMEX> applicants .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95</ENAMEX> spots were offered <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the following year</ENAMEX> , the number of applicants rose again to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1400</ENAMEX> .
Currently , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">around a dozen</ENAMEX> public and private universities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chiaotung University</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Sun Yat - sen University</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Da - Yeh Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Yuan - Ze Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> , offer advanced degree programs for executive management personnel .
What is it that makes graduate programs in management so popular among the working population ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liao Ching - jong</ENAMEX> , director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">College of Management</ENAMEX> , relates that new entrants into the professional ranks concentrate on accumulating professional know - how , while seasoned middle - and top - level executives seek an edge in management .
And while most recent university graduates are able to apply professional know - how upon entering the work force , one is not necessarily taught management in the workplace .
Hence universities are the place for systematic instruction on management .
" Given the speed at which the business environment is changing , many new concepts were not previously taught , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se - hwa</ENAMEX> , dean of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">College of Commerce</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> notes that such new fields as venture capital , technology management , intellectual property , and e-commerce are all recent additions to the curriculum over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</ENAMEX> .
Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Ming - je</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">College of Management</ENAMEX> adds : " With small , medium - size and family businesses forming the backbone of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> industry , one could do just fine without professional management .
But in the age of the global village , many bosses are finding that relying on ' instinct ' to make business decisions is not enough , and that they need systematic management concepts . "
Other management experts note that once <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> joins <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the World Trade Organization</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WTO</ENAMEX> -RRB- , foreign universities will be able to recruit students directly in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , and that with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ministry of Education</ENAMEX> asking national universities to come up with a portion of their own funding , universities are doubly motivated to establish programs of this sort .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> , which enjoys the distinction of being <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's premier institution of higher education , " never lacks for students , because there are always people who want to attend <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Ming - je</ENAMEX> .
More than a diploma
In order to accommodate professionals with day jobs , many universities have scheduled their business management courses during evening hours .
The sight of professionals in suits and ties rushing to class at dusk contrasts greatly from the typical jeans and casual attire of fresh - faced undergrads .
Shuttling between the office and the campus , do they ever feel like they 're burning the candle at both ends ?
At some schools , even professionals boasting <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ph.D.</ENAMEX> degrees are coming back to school for <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Master 's degrees</ENAMEX> .
Is the degree really that important to them ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mouton Lee</ENAMEX> , in charge of over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">80</ENAMEX> employees and production of key components as president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABBA Linear Tech Co. , Ltd.</ENAMEX> , is a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">second - year</ENAMEX> student in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Graduate School of Management</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> relates that as a youth he studied because he was forced to , but now his motivations for learning are far greater - so great in fact that he registered for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> classes at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of the semester</ENAMEX> , a decision he has come to regret for lack of time .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> , who has also taken short - term management courses , says , " Degree programs are better , since the pressure makes you grow . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mouton Lee</ENAMEX> would like <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">a Master 's degree</ENAMEX> , yet <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> he studies for the knowledge it brings .
Ever since graduating with a degree in mechanical engineering from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> and setting out to start his own business over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</ENAMEX> , that degree has sat in a drawer somewhere , relegated to mere symbolic significance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsieh Sun - chi</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Control Yuan 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Office of Information Management</ENAMEX> and a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25 - year</ENAMEX> veteran of civil service , relates that he has already attained the highest rank a general civil servant can achieve , yet at the age of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50</ENAMEX> he still has over a decade until retirement .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Two years ago</ENAMEX> , this led him to consider taking a new direction , and he tested into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">College of Commerce</ENAMEX> intent on making connections with movers and shakers in different fields .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang Chin - tsung</ENAMEX> , a researcher at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chung - Shan Institute of Science -AMP- Technology</ENAMEX> with a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ph.D.</ENAMEX> in mechanical engineering from a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> university , shuttles between his office in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taoyuan</ENAMEX> s <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lungtan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> campus <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> each week .
Long immersed in the sciences and always focusing on numbers and statistics , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chang</ENAMEX> says he feels like he " has gotten into a mental rut . "
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsinchu</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chiaotung University</ENAMEX> offers a similar management curriculum , he was concerned that the students there would be science park types with similar backgrounds in high tech fields .
Thus he would rather spend the extra time commuting to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> to be around students with experience in such fields as advertising , finance , and architecture .
" I 'd be lying if I said the degree does n't matter .
If it did n't , why not just get into a non-degree program ?
The truth is that a degree in management does nothing to help me in my current job , but it gives me a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> skill if I choose another route in the future . "
Advanced training for professionals has become a hot topic among executives over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two years</ENAMEX> , but continuing education is nothing new among <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> 's universities .
For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Public Administration Center</ENAMEX> has offered graduate extension courses for executives for over a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">decade</ENAMEX> , the difference being that , upon completion of the curriculum students only receive a certificate of course credit .
In comparison , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">a Master 's degree</ENAMEX> is far more appealing , given that a degree is awarded upon completion of studies .
Burning the proverbial candle
Motivated by the degree or not , the enthusiasm of these professionals for their studies is impressive .
Nevertheless , they must pay a hefty price to be able to study in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> place .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , working during the day and attending classes at night is often a war of energy and will .
Next , they must shuffle their work schedules to accommodate their studies .
Many of them have to reschedule business trips .
Meanwhile , some become highway speeders , rushing from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taoyuan</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hsinchu</ENAMEX> to attend class .
And female managers , ordinarily responsible for household chores as well , really burn the proverbial candle at both ends .
" I have my time perfectly allotted , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morna Lee</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> regional business manager for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kellogg 's</ENAMEX> .
She divides her schedule into <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> cycles , and with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> class on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> afternoons , her company does its best to accommodate her by not holding meetings that involve her on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day of the week</ENAMEX> .
Still , sometimes nothing can be done , such as the time that she had a meeting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">early one Friday morning</ENAMEX> , forcing her to miss class on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> while she flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> .
She had to fly quickly back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> to make class on <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Saturday afternoon</ENAMEX> .
Despite often staying up until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">2:00 or 3:00 AM</ENAMEX> to study or write reports , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> likes mingling in the executive management class with a diverse group of students from different fields , and feels that the new ideas the professors feed them help keep her brain supple .
Moreover , she muses , " We managers are a strange breed .
If we do n't exhaust ourselves , we end up sick . "
Female professionals like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morna Lee</ENAMEX> represent a minority among executive degree students , accounting for just <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about five percent</ENAMEX> .
" If you asked me whether work or family is more important , I would say that since entering society <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 years ago</ENAMEX> work has always come <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> , " states <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donna Sun</ENAMEX> , vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Human Resource Division</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Schmidt Scientific Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
Even if she has no classes to attend , leaving the office at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">8:00 PM</ENAMEX> is no different from the perspective of her family life than the extra hour she spends attending classes until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">9:00 PM</ENAMEX> .
She is thankful that her son , a university student , and her daughter , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - year</ENAMEX> junior high school student , have always been very independent and self - reliant .
Hiring someone to help with housework , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee</ENAMEX> is a model for the children when it comes to studying , even taking them to the library on breaks to conduct research .
No magic bullet
Compared to young students focused on getting a degree , the motivations of professionals studying for advanced degrees " are not that simple . "
They might be after new knowledge , keen to sport a fancy degree from a graduate school like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chengchi University</ENAMEX> , out to network with others , or looking out for the survival of business and to raise competitiveness by searching for answers to difficult work or business issues .
" Looking for quick answers from professors is a misguided concept , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Ming - je</ENAMEX> , professor of strategic management at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Department of International Business</ENAMEX> .
Before commencing a course , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> tells his students , " I am not in the consulting business .
There are no magic bullets , for if I had any I 'd have gotten rich long ago . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se - hwa</ENAMEX> , dean of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">College of Commerce</ENAMEX> , relates , " Academic institutions provide systematic thinking , not the answers to specific questions . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> tells his students that if they put other things aside and concentrate on their studies for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three weeks</ENAMEX> , maybe they 'll find the answer themselves .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> notes that adult students bring rich practical experience to the table , and lack only the knowledge to combine and integrate scattered experience .
For them , returning to school is valuable for establishing their own modes of thinking with the knowledge they pick up .
Unlike <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 20th century</ENAMEX> , where the amount of capital was the greatest factor determining success , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se - hwa</ENAMEX> believes that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next century</ENAMEX> will be about " knowledge as the main competitive force . "
The book <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The 500 - year Delta</ENAMEX> notes that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1960s</ENAMEX> each executive might only have to learn <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> new skill each year , such as how to use a computer or send e-mail .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1990s</ENAMEX> , accumulation of know - how accelerated many times over , so that executives needed to learn something new each day .
Now , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 21st century</ENAMEX> , each manager might have to learn something new <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">every single hour of the working day</ENAMEX> .
Curriculums need selling points
In order to satisfy students with diverse expectations and needs for basic knowledge , what innovative means must a professor resort to ?
And what challenges does this pose for the institution itself ?
People are going to fall asleep no matter what , so you have to think on your feet and use different techniques to stimulate their attention , " remarks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Gia - khy Tang</ENAMEX> , professor in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Risk Management and Insurance</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University</ENAMEX> .
Students who have been away from the classroom for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">well over a decade</ENAMEX> can not be expected to remember all the formulas they learned in statistics and economics classes way back when .
Nor should classes turn into solo performances by the professor .
Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> 's approach is to lecture on theory for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</ENAMEX> , then use the remaining time on the homework that each group worked on since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous week</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> 's own " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> No's " policy guides his teaching approach : No midterms , no final exams , and no calling on students .
Instead , grades are based on homework results and class participation .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> 's risk management class is discussing how to identify risks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of the questions is : " If there were a fairy who could spell out for you exactly what you would experience for the rest of your life , consider what advantages and disadvantages the following information might have for you .
For instance , no matter how hard you work , you are still fated to be poor all your life .
Or what if you were fated to have everything go your way ?
What if , for example , you 're going to be elected to the legislature , or become the president ? "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Lin</ENAMEX> , associate professor of marketing at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">NTUST</ENAMEX> , describes the main difference between teaching adult executives and regular students :
" Executives are always asking questions .
Even when they have an idea themselves , they 'll still bring up issues they encountered in their jobs to see how you respond . "
Often , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lin</ENAMEX> , such questions leave him stumped .
Another issue for adult students always on the run is their unfamiliarity with the campus .
In order to enhance their sense of identification with the school , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> designed an overseas business camp program .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> professor made a big hit with over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> students , taking them to mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> for over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten days</ENAMEX> to familiarize them with the investment environment there .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</ENAMEX> , trips are planned to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
Planting in fertile soil
Judging from the manner in which universities are opening their doors for continuing education , non-degree programs , and professional training , higher education in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> appears to be undergoing a sort of makeover .
With these changes , universities must not only take care of teaching and research , but must also make sure they play their <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">third</ENAMEX> function properly - spreading knowledge and sharing it with the public .
Still , detractors point out that university graduate programs for business executives appear to be elitist .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> student attending a non-degree program at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> relates that there are not enough spots to go around in the executive degree programs .
Hoping to make the switch from the non-degree program , he failed to pass the screening that is administered prior to the admissions test .
" If you fail a test , you only have yourself to blame , but tripping up on the initial screening is just a matter of not having a high enough job title . "
Each year when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EMBA</ENAMEX> program acceptances are released , newspapers carry letters from readers relating how certain national university graduate schools compete to accept CEOs and presidents of listed corporations , or the children of rich business people .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> student expresses cynicism toward the application and review process , suspecting that " they just pay attention to company name and job title . "
Moreover , continuing education courses charge hefty tuition fees .
For instance , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> divides the school year into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> semesters , at NT$ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50,000</ENAMEX> per semester , while other institutions charge between NT$ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3700</ENAMEX> and $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> per credit , a full <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times more than regular graduate student tuition .
Such instances naturally lead to suspicion that graduate schools such as these are " out to make a killing " by catering only to an elite few .
" From review , to written test , to oral exam , in order to ensure fairness , no professor is involved in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than one</ENAMEX> portion of the process , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang Chung - hsing</ENAMEX> , director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EMBA</ENAMEX> program at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> .
Still , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> admits that the bigger the company and higher the candidate 's job title , the greater their chances of acceptance into the program .
This can be partially attributed to the belief among professors that the commitment of their educational resources yields " more bang for the buck . "
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang Ming - je</ENAMEX> forthrightly explains , university professors ' time is a national resource , and if they can have a positive impact on an executive controlling budgets of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">billions of NT dollars</ENAMEX> , their contribution to country and society is considerable .
Asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Liao Ching - jong</ENAMEX> , director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Graduate School of Management</ENAMEX> , concurs , " Which is greater , the marginal benefit of a company president or a staff member 's education ?
The president can go back and put what she learns into practice right away . "
What is more , even if schools do not deliberately seek out company presidents , they invariably perform better on oral exams - perhaps due to their greater experience .
" We must ask ourselves some questions , too , when <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EMBAs</ENAMEX> are thought of as giving away degrees to the privileged few , " comments <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se - Hwa</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> tells his professors that unless they perform well in class , the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EMBA</ENAMEX> can not develop further , as universities are founded upon academic research .
As for tuition policies , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Se - Hwa</ENAMEX> relates that with an annual budget of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 2.1 billion</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University</ENAMEX> spends about NT$ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">200,000</ENAMEX> per student .
Thus , when it comes down to calculating costs , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 10,000</ENAMEX> per credit is actually quite cheap .
Industry retooling
The <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EMBA</ENAMEX> craze reflects the cold , intense competition of social <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Darwinism</ENAMEX> , but does it also signify that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> industry is beginning to devote greater attention to the training of top executives ?
Many scholars believe that with the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">EMBA</ENAMEX> phenomenon just getting off its feet in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , many corporate bosses are taking a " wait - and - see " attitude .
This is reflected in the way students approach the programs , not informing their bosses that they have applied to a program until they have been accepted , and not occupying work time if school takes place in the evening .
This way , their boss 's attitude has no particular bearing on what they do .
Perhaps business education may not be widespread in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> at this time , yet a small number of company bosses have taken the lead themselves - taking advanced courses and setting an example for management personnel .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma Yu - shan</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kingdom Construction</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">64 years</ENAMEX> old <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , tested into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">College of Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> , becoming <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> 's oldest student .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma</ENAMEX> , " living and learning " is more than just a maxim , as each year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kingdom Construction</ENAMEX> employees are required to undergo <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">80 hours</ENAMEX> of on - the - job training .
" For the boss to lead his team , he ca n't just tell his subordinates to learn , while he remains static himself .
Not to mention that in discussions with employees , if they know you 're the kind of boss who does n't seek to further himself , they put less stock in what you say , " notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma</ENAMEX> .
With the rapid changes in the business environment , poor decision - making can have serious consequences for company development .
" The pressure on the boss is tremendous , because nobody comes to the CEO with easy questions . "
Too busy to attend regular courses , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ma Yu - shan</ENAMEX> took the advice of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTU</ENAMEX> professor and hired a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Ph.D.</ENAMEX> student to tutor him one semester in " management economics . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Amber Huang</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Changhua</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Feng Huei Steel -AMP- Iron Company</ENAMEX> , is a student in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Business Administration</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NTUST</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> notes <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> advantages of the boss going to school .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , it 's good for his company 's image .
As his company must frequently seek bank loans , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Huang</ENAMEX> asks rhetorically , " Could a studious boss be a bad guy ? "
This image has helped him secure loans with little difficulty every time .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">Second</ENAMEX> , it sets a good example for employees .
Lastly , speaking the professional lingo fluently helps enhance his authority .
Knowledge for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the new century</ENAMEX>
In the effort to cultivate management talent , many prominent multinational corporations have founded their own teaching institutions , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel University</ENAMEX> being <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> good examples .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Acer Group 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aspire Academy</ENAMEX> opened its doors in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lungtan</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taoyuan Country</ENAMEX> -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last October</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years of planning</ENAMEX> .
During the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Aspire Academy</ENAMEX> opening ceremony , academy president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Shih</ENAMEX> , chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Acer Group</ENAMEX> , remarked that he hopes to introduce management models from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> and mesh them with the unique attributes of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> industry to enhance the globalization of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shih</ENAMEX> noted that through the sharing of experiences , emerging businesses might save themselves a lot of groping in the dark .
Are people at the fin de siecle inspired to learn by the confluence of technology , humanities , and economic knowledge ?
At least the entrepreneurs , managers , and executives in campuses around <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> clearly recognize that learning is a necessity for survival and an engine of growth .
