Turning to <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF> on <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the " One China " Issue</COREF>
*PRO* Still wrestling with <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the vexed issue of " one China</COREF> , " <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the President 's Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations</COREF> met for <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sixth and seventh sessions during November , amid frenzied media attention .
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">The group</COREF> eventually reached <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">a consensus that <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the " one China " principle</COREF> advocated * by the mainland should be addressed *-1 " in accordance with <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF></COREF> . "
How president Chen Shui - bian responds to <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">this proposal</COREF> *T*-1 will determine whether or not <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the " one China " stalemate</COREF> can be broken *-2 , and if there is *PRO* to be a set timetable for *PRO* implementing the three direct links .

After *PRO* assuming <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the presidency</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> recruited a number of leading politicians , industrialists , academics and other personages for a non-partisan advisory group , intended * to build cross-party consensus on the subject of relations with <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> .
Chaired * by <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Academia Sinica</COREF> president Lee Yuan - tseh</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the Presidential Advisory Group on Cross-Strait Relations</COREF> *T*-1 first met in early September .
Since then <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the Group</COREF> has held a series of intensive discussions on <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> fundamental position regarding the cross-strait relationship .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">The Group</COREF> entered the final phase of discussions on <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the " one China " issue</COREF> during November , but differences between pro-unification and pro-independence participants continued *-1 to stymie the effort *PRO* to produce a statement acceptable to all .
As <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">DPP</COREF> legislator Shen Fu - hsiung pointed out , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the Group</COREF> had *-1 to <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">draft</COREF> something " palatable both to the pro-unification and pro-independence camps ; something which <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the DPP</COREF> ca n't shun *T*-2 and yet which *T*-3 does n't make <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF> wince . "
Clearly <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">no easy task</COREF> .
On the evening of November 18 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Advisory Group</COREF> chairman Lee Yuan - tseh , meeting over dinner with <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">DPP</COREF> faction leaders</COREF> , described the cross-strait situation as extremely precarious , and said that since time is not on <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> side we need *-1 to step up efforts *PRO* to resume dialogue with <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> .
Separately , during <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> report to the Legislative Yuan on <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the Academia Sinica 's</COREF> budget , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> reiterated : " If the whole population could arrive at a consensus on <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">' one China</COREF> , ' then <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">President Chen</COREF> would have no grounds for *PRO* not accepting that consensus . "
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> added that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> hoped 0 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the Advisory Group</COREF> would shortly come to a firm conclusion on <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the " one China " issue</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Yuan - tseh 's</COREF> appeal made little impression on <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the governing DPP</COREF> , however .
Furthermore , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">DPP</COREF> chairman Frank Hsieh <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> came under fire within <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the party</COREF> after *PRO* stating : " <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">The constitution of <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF></COREF> is <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> a one China framework .
Since <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the DPP</COREF> has participated in the process of constitutional amendment <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ought *-1 to accept <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">this constitution</COREF> , and as the party of government <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> ca n't afford *PRO*-2 to override or reject <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> . "
According to <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">DPP</COREF> lawmaker Lin Cho - shui</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> has shown more goodwill *ICH*-1 to <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF> as president than Lee Teng - hui ever did *?* , but without any response -
so why should <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> once again be expected *-3 to respond on <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the " one China " issue</COREF> *T*-2 ?
Also , <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> disagrees with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Yuan - tseh 's</COREF> assertion that " time is not on our side , " and instead feels that things are no worse than before .
Meanwhile , the opposition alliance has been calling for <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the DPP</COREF> *PRO* to " shed <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> ideological baggage . "
On November 24 <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the New Party , which *T*-1 had already pulled out of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the Advisory Group</COREF></COREF> , published an article in the press signed * by leading members such as Yu Mu - ming and Chen Kui - miao , in which <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> called on <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> *T*-2 *PRO* to take <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> as <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> starting point for *PRO* breaking <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the " one China " deadlock</COREF> .
<COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> pointed out that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> and <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the DPP</COREF> had competed in elections in accordance with <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> , *PRO*-1 winning <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the presidency</COREF> and a share of seats in the legislature and the National Assembly , and had also participated in the process of *PRO* revising <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> .
Now , with <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> constitutionally granted mandate , <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the party</COREF> has an obligation *PRO* to fully uphold <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> .

As the politicians argued , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Formosa Plastics boss Wang Yung - ching</COREF> convened a meeting with other captains of industry *PRO* to come up with some advice for <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> on economic policy .
For the first time <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> voiced support for <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Yuan - tseh 's</COREF> proposal that " with ' one China ' as the precondition , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">each side</COREF> can have <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own interpretation . "
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> also agreed with <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Lee 's</COREF> notion that time is running out for <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , in the belief that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> will only have time on <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> side once <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> starts *-1 to carry out well - intentioned engagement with the mainland .
Consensus on <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the " one China question "</COREF> is an urgent priority for both sides if there is *PRO* to be a peaceful future .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Yung - ching 's</COREF> demand for a review of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> " go slow " policy , and opening of the three direct links , brought a personal phone call from <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> , who *T*-1 invited <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 to come and discuss policy .
On November 25 <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> and a handful of other leading industrialists</COREF> went *PRO*-1 to call on <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> at <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> official residence .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">The businessmen</COREF> said that *PRO* shelving <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the " one China " issue</COREF> was not the right thing 0 for <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> to do *T*-1 , and that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> could no longer afford *PRO*-2 to play word games .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> stressed the need for early restoration of the mechanism for cross-strait economic dialogue , and said that <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> should also think about *PRO* moving towards political dialogue .

<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The Presidential Advisory Group</COREF> met again on November 26 , and discussed a proposal *ICH*-2 , made * earlier by Public Television System chairman Wu Feng - shan and already favored * by most members of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the Group</COREF> , for <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">" one China "</COREF> to be addressed *-1 through " three acknowledgements and four suggestions . "
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">A firm consensus</COREF> was finally arrived at *-1 , and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the Group</COREF> submitted to <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> proposal that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> should " respond to <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland 's ' one China ' proposition</COREF> in accordance with the constitution of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF> . "
The government and opposition parties continued *-2 to disagree regarding <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this consensus</COREF> .
DPP legislator Lin Cho - shui described <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as " acceptable , if not very satisfactory . "
PFP spokesman Li Ching - an called <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 " a conclusion without a conclusion . "
New Party convenor Hau Lung - pin said 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the statement</COREF> was too ambiguous , *PRO* tending towards " one China , with <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">each side</COREF> free *PRO* to make <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own interpretation , " and added that it was highly unlikely *-1 to be used *-1 by <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> as a guide for cross-strait policy .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ting Shou - chung</COREF> , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">deputy executive director of the KMT policy committee</COREF> , said 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this so - called consensus</COREF> was simply a case of *PRO* going round and round on the spot , and would do nothing *PRO*-1 to solve the core problem .
In a November 28 press release , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="69" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Mainland Affairs Council</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="69" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">MAC</COREF> -RRB- , <COREF ID="69" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the government body in charge of cross-strait affairs</COREF></COREF> , diplomatically stated that <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would observe and implement <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the suggestions of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the Advisory Group</COREF></COREF> if and when <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> become official government policy *T*-1 .
*PRO*-1 Speaking on the topic of <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the three direct links</COREF> , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">MAC</COREF> chairwoman Tsai Ing - wen said that <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> will be phased *-2 in according to conditions , with the first phase being the opening of direct business links as *PRO* necessitated * by the admission of both sides to the WTO .
And according to economics minister Lin Hsin - yi , the government recognizes that the " go slow " policy needs *-1 to be relaxed *-1 , and will give a more thorough accounting of this before the end of the year .
