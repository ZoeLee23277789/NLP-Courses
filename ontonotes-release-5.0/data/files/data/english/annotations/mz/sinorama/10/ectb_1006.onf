    Naturally television actors do not have the luxury that movie actors enjoy of allowing themselves time to slowly get in
    the right frame of mind for a role or scene, but even so, given the fact that TV actors must rely almost exclusively on
    dialogue and body language to keep the audience's attention, the fact that shooting is so hurried not only waters down
    the quality of the performance, there is little time even to get the lines right.
