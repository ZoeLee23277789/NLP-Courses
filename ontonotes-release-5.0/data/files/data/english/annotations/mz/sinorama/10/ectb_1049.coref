In paintings , a white cloud layer swirls over Mt. Kuanyin ;
waves on the river drift like a breeze ;
a red sun dances on golden water ;
a yellow moon sings from a deep purple sky . . . .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">The Tanshui of illustrations</COREF> is a place of unblemished beauty , a myth that *T*-1 remains unshakeable .
In the 300 - plus years since <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> founding , <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">this port town - formerly called * *PRO* <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">Huwei</COREF> , now <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui Township</COREF> -</COREF> has seen days of prosperity and has also been through a baptism of fire .
What *T*-2 makes <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> special among the 309 urban and rural townships of Taiwan ?
How do <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF></COREF> live today *T*-1 ?
How do <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> recall the past *T*-1 ?
And how do <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> see the future *T*-1 ?
" You want *PRO*-1 to know how <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> has changed *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say that the biggest change is that the old streets are gone . "
So declares *T*-1 <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="189" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tu Hsiu - yuan</COREF> , <COREF ID="189" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">proprietor of the Hui Yuan Pharmacy , and also director of the Huwei Cultural and Historical Workshop</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> pharmacy is located *-1 on what *T*-2 is now called *-2 *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="203" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chungcheng Road</COREF> , <COREF ID="203" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the oldest streets</COREF> , which <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> natives still call *T*-3 *PRO*-3 Huwei Street .
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">Tu , who *T*-1 has lived <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> whole life in the old neighborhood</COREF> , has watched from <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> doorstep as <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">old shops</COREF> have refurbished <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> in modern style , and modern shops have adopted the look of the old .
For the convenience of cars , the streets have been widened *-1 repeatedly .
In 1988 , <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">the last train on the old <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> Line of the railroad</COREF> chugged into history , *PRO*-1 taking that old slower pace of life with <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
In 1997 the <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> Line of the mass rapid transit system opened , *PRO*-1 bringing <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">floods of visitors</COREF> to <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the town</COREF> .
Yet , while <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">these tourists</COREF> bring a human touch to the streets on weekends and holidays , on ordinary weekdays the silence is accompanied *-1 only by leftover garbage , empty shops , and <COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">those <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">Huwei</COREF> people who *T*-2 refuse *PRO*-2 to leave <COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> old homes</COREF> .

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The golden age of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Huwei</COREF></COREF>
There are different explanations as to the origins of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the word Huwei</COREF> , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the original name for <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
Some say 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was a transliteration of the place name used * by the indigenous people .
But others say 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> comes from a long - gone fishing practice , using a shi hu -LRB- " stone pool " -RRB- .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Early fishermen</COREF> used stones *PRO*-1 to carve a long , narrow catchment -LRB- the so - called " pool " -RRB- in the sand , *PRO*-2 waiting for the tide to carry in fish which <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could then easily scoop *T*-3 up .
Since <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the place now known * as Tanshui</COREF> was at the tail end -LRB- wei -RRB- of this stone pool , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> came *PRO*-1 to be called *-1 *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Huwei</COREF> .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> occupied an important place in the transport network connecting <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> to Southeast Asia .
Even before the arrival of Westerners in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Han Chinese</COREF> often crossed over from <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui , which *T*-1 is relatively close to <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF></COREF> .
Here <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> engaged in barter trade with the Pingpu -LRB- meaning " plains " -RRB- aborigines , with deer skins and sulphur being the most coveted products .
As <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Western powers</COREF> turned <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> eyes to Asia , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> became strategically important .
In the 17th century , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">first the Spanish , and then the Dutch</COREF> , built forts here as symbols of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> claims to territorial control .
In the mid-17th century , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> took control of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and closed <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> to international trade .
Later , as a result of the Sino - French war of 1884 , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> was again opened up *-1 to Western access .
During <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui 's</COREF> golden age</COREF> , large and small boats were constantly coming and going in the harbor , and it *EXP*-1 was not unusual *PRO* to see enormous steamships .
In the latter part of the Qing dynasty , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> was the largest port in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and was the " customs headquarters , " *PRO*-1 also charged *-1 with *PRO* overseeing port activities at <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Keelung</COREF> , Tainan , and Kaohsiung .
However , during the Japanese occupation , as a result of silting , and because the Japanese invested a huge effort in *PRO* developing the port at <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Keelung</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> faded in importance , *PRO*-1 never again to see the likes of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> glory days .

<TEXT PARTNO="002">
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> is a place of many historic sites , a place that *T*-1 invites reflection on things past .
In <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the " foreign district</COREF> , " a missionary named * *PRO* George Mackay established the first hospital for Western medicine in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> ; it was here that in 1878 the first case of paragonimiasis in the world was diagnosed *-1 *T*-2 .
The old church next to the hospital is a mecca for <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> painters .
The schools , homes , and consulates in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the foreign district</COREF> - some long gone , some still standing - testify to the fact that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> was a place of intensive interaction between Chinese and Western cultures .
If you go up Sanmin Street , you will discover <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the head of an old and disused water pipe</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> could be a relic left * behind by <COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the major Japanese infrastructure projects</COREF> , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the first tap water station</COREF> .
Or you could walk instead next to the MRT station and see <COREF ID="ectb_1049.part-002-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">another first for <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> : <COREF ID="ectb_1049.part-002-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the first seaplane landing area , also built * in <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese occupation era</COREF></COREF> .
Or you could visit <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the venerable Tamkang Secondary School</COREF> .
As you watch the children laughing and arguing and playing , you can think back to the time when the Japanese government did not <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">allow</COREF> Taiwanese and Japanese to attend school together *T*-1 .
Under <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">those circumstances</COREF> , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Tamkang Middle School</COREF> became a cradle for the training of Taiwanese elites .
Gradually you will discover that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> is a bookish place .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">This little town</COREF> has everything from nursery schools to graduate schools .
During the reign of the Guangxu emperor of the Qing dynasty -LRB- which *T*-1 began in 1875 -RRB- , and prior to the beginning of <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese occupation</COREF> in 1895 , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> produced two successful candidates in the highest level military exam , one in the highest level civil exam , and countless successes in lower - level imperial exams .
Even in modern times , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the town</COREF> has not passed up chances *PRO* to embrace knowledge : When the idea of *PRO* founding <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Tam - kang University</COREF> in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> was going * to be abandoned * because of a lack of land and money *T*-2 , local residents offered cheap land , donated money , and lobbied so that <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the university</COREF> could set <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> roots in town .
These historic sites are near the river , but do n't spend all your time there .
*PRO* Do n't forget <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the Tatun Mountains , which *T*-1 shelter <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the town</COREF></COREF> .
In the old days , <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> folk who *T*-1 cultivated farms on the slopes</COREF> had *-2 to walk for an hour *PRO*-2 to get to <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> crops .
These days you can take a local mini-bus .
In <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">the mountains</COREF> you will see the occasional terraced field grown * over with weeds .
This land , which *T*-1 has gone from grass to grain and back to grass again , is where <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">many an old Tanshui native</COREF> played when <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were children *T*-3 *T*-2 .

<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The weeping river</COREF>
Have you heard of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the weeping junks</COREF> ?
During the Sino - French war , Taiwan governor Liu Mingchuan , attempting *PRO* to obstruct a French landing , scuttled <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">several of these boats</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is said *-2 that , late at night , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the sunken junks</COREF> make moaning sounds .
But <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think that it may be <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the river <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> that *T*-1 is moaning .
In 1998 , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> produced <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">a plan for <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">a riverside expressway to <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The road , which *T*-1 was expected *-1 to have three levels</COREF> , would have cut through rare mangroves and created a barrier between <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the river</COREF> and <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the town of Tanshui</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> had been implemented *-1 , people who *T*-2 wanted *PRO*-2 to go to <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> and gaze out over <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the river</COREF> would have had *-3 to find some very high vantage point in town *PRO*-3 to do so !
Fortunately , thanks to efforts by cultural and environmental activists from <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> was first postponed *-1 , and then was ultimately killed *-1 after an environmental impact assessment released * in September refused *PRO*-2 to approve <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the scheme</COREF> .
But a question remains : Is something like this bound *-1 to come sooner or later ?
" For the purposes of development , the <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> coast has been constantly exploited *-1 .
But what *T*-1 will be result of this incessant struggle against nature ? " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">an agitated Tu Hsiu - yuan</COREF> .
And Hsieh Teh - hsi of the Tamsui Culture Foundation adds : " <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">High - rises</COREF> are going up one after another in <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1049.part-004-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tanshui New Town</COREF> [ <COREF ID="ectb_1049.part-004-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a huge government - planned development</COREF> ]</COREF> , but many of <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the apartments</COREF> remain empty .
Everybody here knows that when the northeast winds blow in during the winter *T*-1 , <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is the coldest place around .
No wonder 0 <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">those apartments</COREF> are not selling ! "
<COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">Tu</COREF> says , with disbelief and exasperation in <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> voice : " Do you know that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are going *-1 to build a huge bridge between <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> and Pali ?
It 's such a beautiful and historic location , but <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are just going *-1 to stick up a bridge there , and <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are even talking about *PRO* having a rotating restaurant on top ! "
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Lovers of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF></COREF> , while *PRO*-1 keeping close watch over <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> , are fearful that the giant beast of development may eventually come and bulldoze <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> away one piece of land at a time .

When the old buildings are gone , and people lose contact with the great outdoors *T*-1 , will <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> even be worthy of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> reputation anymore ?
