<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan News</COREF> Holds <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Seminar on Cross-Strait Relations</COREF>
The biggest story of the year in <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has naturally been the changing of the guard at the presidential palace as a result of the <COREF ID="ectb_1020-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="136" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Democratic Progressive Party</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="136" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">DPP</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> victory in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> on 18 March .
<COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="140" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jin Zhong</COREF> , <COREF ID="140" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president and editor - in - chief of <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong 's</COREF> OPEN magazine , which *T*-1 specializes in political reporting and commentary</COREF></COREF></COREF> , spent an entire week in <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *PRO*-2 observing <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the election campaign</COREF> and <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> aftermath , and on 20 March , <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">OPEN</COREF> organized <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">a seminar titled * *PRO* " The New President and Cross-Strait Relations</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">The seminar</COREF> was held *-1 in cooperation with <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Taiwan News</COREF> , <COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the island 's</COREF> oldest English - language newspapers -LRB- known * until last year as the China News -RRB-</COREF></COREF> .
The KMT ticket finished nearly 14 percentage points behind independent candidate James Soong and pulled in fully two million votes fewer than <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="ectb_1020-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">DPP</COREF> ticket</COREF> , a margin of defeat which <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Jin Zhong</COREF> described *T*-1 in <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> opening remarks as stunning .
When <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese Communist premier Zhu Rongji</COREF> <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">made</COREF> belligerent remarks a few days before <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> in an effort *PRO* to scare voters away from <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="ectb_1020-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">DPP</COREF> ticket</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">the ruling party</COREF> made a grievous mistake , opined *?* <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Jin</COREF> , when <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> failed *-2 to come out *PRO*-2 strongly critical of <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Zhu</COREF> and attempted instead *PRO*-2 to capitalize on <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">the incident</COREF> by *PRO* playing the " fear card *T*-3 . "
At the same time , however , <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">winning candidate Chen Shui - bian</COREF> captured only 39 % of the vote , which *T*-1 translates to a weak mandate .
As a result , <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> must take a moderate line that *T*-1 stresses inter-party cooperation .
<COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> will have *-1 to include a wide range of people in <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> government , keep a low profile , guard against any temptation *PRO* to grow imperious in power , and strive *PRO*-1 to be a president of all the people .
As for <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China 's</COREF> saber - rattling , <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Jin</COREF> argued that there is no need for undue concern .
Stated *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Jin</COREF> , " The consequences would be too severe .
It 's not like <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is without any means of retaliation .
Are the mainland authorities really prepared *PRO*-1 to see <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> and Shanghai go up in flames ? "
There are other perspectives on cross-strait relations , of course .
The seminar participants basically fell into three camps on future prospects .
Some were highly optimistic , others were guardedly optimistic , and a third group argued that the crystal ball has gone cloudy .
Perhaps the most optimistic view was expressed *-1 by <COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="273" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ruan Ming</COREF> , <COREF ID="273" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a visiting professor at Tamkang University 's Department of China Studies who *T*-2 in the 1980s was an assistant to former Chinese Communist Secretary General Hu Yaobang</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT">Ruan</COREF> stated that <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing 's</COREF> basic position on <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has not changed at all since the days of Deng Xiaoping .
" There 's nothing new in what <COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're saying *T*-1 . "
The only thing 0 <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese Communists</COREF> are saying *T*-1 , says *?* <COREF ID="272" TYPE="IDENT">Ruan</COREF> , is that <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will attack " if <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> makes any sort of formal move toward independence , " and <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has no need *PRO* to formalize anything because *PRO* changing <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> name would be meaningless .
" No matter what you call *T*-1 *PRO*-1 yourself , people are still going *-2 to call you <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
It 's just like in <COREF ID="326" TYPE="IDENT">England</COREF> - <COREF ID="327" TYPE="IDENT">the official name</COREF> is the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , but nobody calls <COREF ID="326" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="327" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
And there 's no need *PRO* to going around *PRO* <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">shouting</COREF> , ' We 're a country ! We 're a country ! '
Who in the international community does <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> *T*-1 ? "

Pragmatism , please
" <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> needs *-2 to be more pragmatic , " says *?* <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ruan</COREF> , " just like <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> made a lot of noise ahead of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> *PRO*-2 trying *PRO*-2 to sway votes , but once <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> was over <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> backpedaled quickly with the simple statement , " <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll wait and see what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say and do *T*-3 . "
The attitude with <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ruan 's</COREF> view , is very pragmatic .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ruan</COREF> is optimistic about cross-strait relations under the new regime , and states , " <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> is best positioned *-1 to improve cross-strait relations . "
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> likens <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the staunchly anti-communist Richard Nixon , who *T*-1 was able *PRO*-1 to normalize ties with <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese Communists</COREF> precisely because <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was trusted *-2 by the American people</COREF> .
Similarly , when <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> negotiates with <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF> *T*-1 , no one will worry about <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> selling <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> down the river .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The noted political commentator</COREF> <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chin Heng - wei</COREF> , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief editor of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> Contemporary Monthly</COREF> , agreed strongly with <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Ruan 's</COREF> comments , and added , " In <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">this election</COREF> <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> were even more concerned about domestic issues than <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were *?* about cross-strait relations . "
The most pressing issues facing <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the new president</COREF> are education , the environment , " black gold " politics -LRB- murky connections between the worlds of politics , business , and organized crime -RRB- , and crime fighting .
When Nobel laureate Lee Yuan - tseh came out in support of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> , *PRO*-1 implying that the DPP represented " the progressive forces in society *T*-2 , " <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Chen 's</COREF> support jumped immediately upward .
Virtually everyone at the seminar was in agreement that it *EXP*-1 is neither advisable nor necessary *PRO* to seek a quick solution to the cross-strait issue , and that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> need only avoid *PRO*-2 stirring up Chinese nationalism .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1020.part-001-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD" E_OFF="1">Wei Chengsi</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1020.part-001-E4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">news director at ATV news in Hong Kong and a former director of policy research in the public relations department of the municipal party committee in Shanghai</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> emphasized the fluid nature of <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing 's</COREF> policy on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> feels that the mainland authorities face many more pressing issues than <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and that the current tension basically stems from President Lee Teng - hui 's pronouncement on state - to - state relations .
*PRO*-1 Having been through the Tiananmen massacre , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Wei</COREF> felt compelled *PRO*-1 to warn <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> , " You absolutely must not think the way 0 the students did in <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF> in '89 *T*-2 .
You must not think that ' <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the communists</COREF> wo n't attack because <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> wo n't let <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , ' and then go out of your way *PRO*-1 to provoke <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to where <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> no longer have an out *T*-2 .
Under the wrong circumstances , failure *PRO* to display strong Chinese nationalism could spell political suicide for <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">a Communist Party leader</COREF> , and <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might well <COREF ID="ectb_1020.part-001-E9" TYPE="IDENT">decide</COREF> , ' To hell with <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> and economic development , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've got *PRO*-1 to attack if <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm *PRO*-2 to stay in power . '
<COREF ID="ectb_1020.part-001-E9" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> would be an incredible disaster . "
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chiu Hsiang - chung</COREF> , <COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief editor of the Hong Kong Economic Journal</COREF></COREF> , also advocated cautious optimism .
In <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> view , there has been no fundamental change in the cross-strait relationship , but <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> listed a few variables that *T*-1 bear close watching .
The first is the combination of nationalism and <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">Jiang Zemin 's</COREF> desire *PRO* to serve another term as Secretary General of the Communist Party and make <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mark on history .
Could <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> attempt *PRO*-1 to use nationalism *PRO* to further <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> ambition ?
Second , the People 's Liberation Army hopes *PRO*-1 to parlay the <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> issue into increased influence in domestic politics .
Third , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> could make mistakes and give <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese Communists</COREF> an excuse for military action .
And a fourth factor is the wishy - washy American support for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
If all of these variables combined in the wrong way , the military authorities could make a miscalculation that *T*-1 would lead to war .

When hawk meets hawk *T*-1
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chou Chi - ping</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="4" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">senior advisor at Business Weekly</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> and <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tseng Fu - sheng</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">general secretary of the KMT 's Department of Mainland Operations</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> felt that the future of cross-strait relations is still up in the air .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Chou</COREF> , as a former official with the Straits Exchange Foundation , has had direct dealings with <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese Communists</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> argued that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the DPP 's</COREF> view of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> has always been colored *-1 by ideology , and thus take a dim view of the other side .
It *EXP*-1 is true , acknowledges *?* <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Chou</COREF> , that <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> has changed <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> basic stance and now says that <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> " will not change <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> name , declare independence , or seek *PRO*-2 to enshrine the state - to - state principle in the constitution . "
It *EXP*-1 is also true that <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Yuan - tseh -LRB- who *T*-2 is highly respected *-2 in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> for <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> academic achievements -RRB-</COREF> has vouched for the sensibility of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Chen 's</COREF> approach to cross-strait relations .
And yes , once again , it *EXP*-1 is true that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese Communists</COREF> have muted <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rhetoric considerably .
Nevertheless , the two sides view each other with suspicion .
If <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese Communists</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1020-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">conclude</COREF> that <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> leadership</COREF> has dropped <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> insistence on formal independence *PRO*-2 only to pursue <COREF ID="ectb_1020.part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">a policy that *T*-1 includes de facto independence as <COREF ID="ectb_1020.part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> aim</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Chou</COREF> argued that <COREF ID="ectb_1020-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> will introduce a note of uncertainty into the relationship .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Tseng Fu - sheng</COREF> feels that <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> should claim the high ground by *PRO* holding up <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> experience in democratization as an example for <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese Communists</COREF> .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Tseng</COREF> , " Reunification depends entirely on whether <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> can democratize . "
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> biggest worry is that the deep gulf between <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the DPP</COREF> and the mainland authorities</COREF> could cause <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to misread <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">each other</COREF> .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> stressed that there are both doves and hawks on all sides of the trilateral relationship between <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing , Washington , and Taipei</COREF> .
If the hawks gained the upper hand at the same time in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">all three capitals</COREF> , opined *?* <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Tseng</COREF> , the result could be war .

The seminar attendants also examined <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> domestic situation .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Versatile author and cultural commentator Ping Lu</COREF> offered some very incisive comments regarding <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the post-election protests outside the <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">KMT</COREF> headquarters</COREF> .
In *PRO* demanding that Lee Teng - hui resign as chairman of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT</COREF> *PRO*-1 to take responsibility for the election defeat , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Ping -LRB- <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> a second - generation " mainlander " -RRB-</COREF> argued that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the protest</COREF> revealed an ethnic fault line in Taiwanese society .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a venting of mass frustration on the part of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">one particular ethnic group</COREF> , said *T*-1 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Ping</COREF> , *PRO*-2 noting that most of the protesters were mainlanders .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">This group</COREF> feels a loss of status , for during the many decades of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">KMT</COREF> rule <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have always thought of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> as a privileged " majority " in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> even though in fact <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are a minority .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do not identify with <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> as <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> home , and <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have an unconscious feeling of superiority vis - a - vis the local majority .
In some ways <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> has forced <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="ectb_1020-part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">realize</COREF> that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> truly are a minority .
<COREF ID="ectb_1020-part-003-E6" TYPE="IDENT">This development</COREF> should help *PRO*-1 to bring about long - lasting ethnic harmony in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
The participants generally felt that <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> was a victory for democracy .
On the domestic front , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the victory of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF></COREF> showed that people want more democracy , greater respect for human rights , and a more serious effort *PRO* to banish " black gold " from the political arena .
In cross-strait relations <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">Chen 's</COREF> victory</COREF> spells the end of an era in which the cross-strait relationship was conducted *-1 within the framework of a civil war between <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">he KMT</COREF> and the Chinese Communist Party *T*-2 .
Reform of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT</COREF> and the formation of a new political party by James Soong will also improve the political system in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
It appears that <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> have finally taken <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> first bold step into an era of true democracy , and a mature political system is no longer a distant prospect .
