Tea Capital of Taipei County

*PRO* Take <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">a pinch of Pouchong tea leaves</COREF> , place <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in a cup of boiling - hot water , and before the second hand on the clock has completed a revolution , you 'll be assailed *-1 by <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the delicate fragrance of the freshly made golden green brew</COREF> .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's the same sweet fragrance that *T*-1 fills the air everywhere you go when you 're in <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> *T*-3 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin Township</COREF> is situated *-1 in rural southern Taipei County .
*PRO*-1 Being relatively remote , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the area</COREF> was not developed *-1 until the late 18th century .
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> is a pocket of level ground set * in mountain forests , whence <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> name , which *T*-1 means " forest on level ground . "
*PRO*-1 Arriving there , you 're greeted *-1 by mountainsides of emerald green surrounding <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">the town of <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF></COREF> , and winding through <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">the Peishih River</COREF> , <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> crystal waters so clear that you can see right to the bottom .
The population is steady at about 6,000 - 7,000 .
It seems *-2 just the way 0 <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was *T*-1 20 - odd years ago , and gives the impression that in another 20 years time , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will still retain this way of life without the constant hankering for more .
What *ICH*-3 *ICH*-4 is it *T*-5 about <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin , nestled * on the outskirts of Taipei</COREF> , that *T*-1 makes <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> able *PRO*-2 to maintain an idyllic life free from the lure of material gain ?

*PRO* Roll out the red tape
In 1979 , the Urban Development Law placed <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Pinglin area</COREF> under controls pertaining to Taipei 's water catchment areas , and since then it has been extremely difficult *PRO*-1 to cultivate <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin 's</COREF> agricultural land .
Nor can more buildings be put *-1 up *PRO*-1 to cater to any increase in the population .
All that *T*-1 can be done *-1 are just very minimal repairs and renovations to the already existing housing stock , and this has caused a sharp decline in the value of land there .
Under the myriad regulations , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin 's</COREF> population has plummeted .
Although <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">many</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to return , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> often shy away because of the difficulties 0 life in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> would entail *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Hsin - ping</COREF> is a man in <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> early twenties who *T*-1 works at the Ping Lin Tea Museum .
*PRO*-1 Drinking some wine , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says , " Here in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> we do n't have a single entertainment venue .
Really , not one .
And all the regulations drive us *PRO*-1 crazy .
If you want *PRO*-1 to build a house or do some extension , there 'll be some person coming *PRO* to investigate , and it 's always the same , you ca n't do this , and you ca n't do that . "
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">The many restrictions</COREF> safeguard <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin 's</COREF> beautiful natural setting , but <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> exact a heavy toll from the local people .
Luckily , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> produces fine tea 0 *T*-1 to follow the alcohol in which <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> drown <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cares *T*-2 .

A refined air
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> is an ideal location for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">tea cultivation</COREF> , and many there had been doing <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> since way back , but after <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> started *-1 winning first prizes in the provincial government 's tea competitions , the government began *-2 to pay serious attention to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> tea .
Moreover , *PRO*-1 seeing the profitability of tea , almost all the local farmers began *-1 specializing in tea .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">The freshly picked tips of Oolong tea</COREF> , with <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> green buds and twin leaves , become a bright and luminous gold when *PRO* steeped * in hot water *T*-2 .
Whether *PRO* sold * domestically or exported * , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin 's</COREF> Pouchong tea enjoys a wide market and good distribution channels .
Both superior and inferior grades of tea bring a good return , and so for 90 % of the people of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> , life revolves around tea .
When the spring and autumn tea harvests are on *T*-1 , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the people in every household</COREF> can barely snatch four hours sleep a night , because the whole sequence from *PRO* picking <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the tea leaves</COREF> and processing <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> into <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> final form , requires more than ten uninterrupted hours , at the least .
The fragrance of tea accompanies <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to bed each night , and awaits <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in the morning .
The days go on in this fashion for a month or two .

<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Huang Kuei - ying</COREF> lives in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">rural Pinglin</COREF> .
As a young girl <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> helped with the tea work , and later <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband also cultivated tea .
*PRO*-1 Remembering the grueling heat of summer , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> sighs , " <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Women in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF></COREF> have a really hard life .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> get barely a few hours sleep a night in tea - picking season , and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> still have *-1 to look after <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> family and the housework . "
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> neighbour</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lin</COREF> , laughs in agreement , " <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Tea processing</COREF> , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> just kills you ! "
The Hsin Ping Tea Emporium has won numerous awards in tea competitions .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The proprietor</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Chen</COREF></COREF> , has been associated *-1 with tea since <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was very young : " <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> never got very far in school , so the best thing is *PRO* to keep on * growing tea . "
When we turned to the secret of how *PRO* to process good tea *T*-1 *T*-2 , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Chen</COREF> was spare with words .
" You need focus , and experience . "
Indeed , *PRO* to pick tea you have *-1 to take into account the weather and then , after *PRO* selecting just the right time 0 *PRO* to pick *T*-2 , you carry out a series of fermentation steps that *T*-3 vary depending on just what the leaves are like *T*-4 that day .
How long should the leaves ferment outdoors *T*-1 ?
How long indoors ?
These questions are decided *-1 by <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the grower</COREF> , *PRO* using everything at <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> disposal - eyes , nose , heart , mind , mouth , and hands , all working in harmony .
A tiny bit more , a second less - it 's a discipline and an art .
*PRO* Following fermentation , step by step , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the tips</COREF> are withered and crumbled *-1 , any lumps are broken *-2 up , then <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the tips</COREF> are fired *-3 .
Each of these steps affects the quality of the finished product .
The timing must be accurately calculated *-1 , the temperature must be precise .
Unfortunately , there are no standards 0 *PRO* to follow *T*-1 .
Absolutely everything relies on each grower 's store of personal experience .

Tough times ahead for tea growers ?
The annual tea competition in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> is a chance for <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">tea growers</COREF> to talk shop .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> examine and appraise the teas , note the aroma and the color of the steeped tea , and assess the good and bad points of every family 's tea .
Different grades will bring different prices on the market .
Award - winning teas often sell out .
For better or worse , the tea growers ' reputations are made *-1 on such occasions .
According to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Chen</COREF> , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the growers</COREF> compare <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> with each other , *PRO*-1 discussing <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> processing methods .
When <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">someone</COREF> does n't do as well as <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had hoped *?* in a tea competition *T*-1 , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> try *PRO*-2 to figure out why <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> tea did n't match up with that of other growers *T*-3 .
" You need *-1 to constantly reflect , review and discuss your processing .
That 's the only way 0 *PRO* to improve the quality *T*-1 . "
These days , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">about 80 % of the people in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF></COREF> still depend on tea for <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> livelihood .
With the economy slowing down , however , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">tea</COREF> is not as easy 0 *PRO* to sell *T*-1 as <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> used *-2 to be *?* .
In the past there used *-1 to be a vigorous export market , but the countries of Southeast Asia have cut into the market .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> has always specialized in quality teas rather than *PRO* cater to the mass - production foreign tea markets , but if even domestic sales are having difficulties , what can <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the growers</COREF> do *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to ensure <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> livelihoods ?
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Huang Kuei - ying</COREF> also comments that <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">tea</COREF> is n't as easy 0 *PRO* to sell *T*-1 as <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> once was *?* .
<COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">Growers</COREF> are sometimes exploited *-1 by middlemen , and the tea grown * with <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sweat and blood ends up *-2 being sold *-2 for a very low price .
" It 's terrible !
Many growers just ca n't find words for what *T*-1 's happening , especially with what *T*-2 's going *-2 to happen later , *PRO* joining that whatever - it - is *T*-3 trade organization .
That could really be a disaster ! "
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Huang 's</COREF> concerns may well be shared *-1 by many others .
Nevertheless , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Chen</COREF> has deep confidence , " As long as <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> tea</COREF> is good , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> need n't fear that no - one will buy <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ! "
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="122" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The township chief</COREF> , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Liang Chin - sheng</COREF></COREF> , does n't hide <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> pride in *RNR*-1 and <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> concerns about *RNR*-1 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin 's</COREF> tea industry .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Liang</COREF> , " Here in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> worship <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">tea</COREF> as a god .
<COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> look after <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> like a sweetheart . "
As well as *PRO* encouraging <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the local people</COREF> *PRO*-2 to constantly enhance <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> tea growing and processing skills , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> devotes even more energy to *PRO* managing the " tea culture " to which tea has given rise , including by - products such as tea pastries and similar light refreshments *T*-1 .
But far more important , is *T*-1 *PRO* to draw deeply on <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin 's</COREF> unique and refined qualities as a tea district and imbue the hearts and minds of local inhabitants and visitors alike with a deep appreciation of tea culture .
With this in mind they are training local people *PRO*-1 to do voluntary cultural work , *PRO* organizing activities associated * with tea , producing and conserving local gazetteers and histories , all richly steeped * in the style and romance of tea .
*PRO*-2 Speaking of the assaults 0 they face *T*-1 with the opening of the market , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the township chief</COREF> knits <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> brows tightly ,
" <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hope 0 the government can do something substantial *PRO*-3 to promote Taiwanese tea and draw up regulations for proper channels for *PRO* marketing tea .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">everyone</COREF> see how good it *EXP*-2 is *T*-1 *PRO* to drink tea , and experience for <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> tea 's benefits .
This is the only way that tea will have a market *T*-1 ; and then the younger generation will be willing *PRO*-2 to take over from us . "

*PRO* Hoping for fewer regulations
In early times <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> was a key waystation on <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the Old Tan Lan Trail leading from Taipei to Ilan</COREF> .
These days <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the old road</COREF> has been replaced *-1 by <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Taipei - Ilan Highway</COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">The current road</COREF> brings a lot of visitors to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> and has made transport of the tea produce much easier .
It *EXP*-1 was originally thought *-2 that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the Taipei - Ilan Expressway , due for completion in 2003</COREF> , would also bring <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> new benefits , but <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is now planning *PRO*-3 to restrict the interchange to only large vehicles and locals from <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> .
This is in order *PRO* to protect the water catchment area .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">The township chief</COREF> throws up <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hands and comments with exasperation that in everything 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> has done *T*-1 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has treated <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the local people</COREF> officiously and shown no confidence in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> view , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> should think of some way whereby both <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> and the water resource protection zone can coexist and prosper *T*-1 .
If <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're afraid that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the new expressway</COREF> will bring hordes of people and pollute the water resources , then what <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should do *T*-1 , within reasonable bounds , is *PRO* allow the people here to build public facilities for <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">visitors</COREF> which *T*-2 will help *PRO*-2 minimise <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> impact on the local ecology , for example public toilets and comprehensive rubbish disposal .
This would give people from outside the area more opportunity *PRO* to appreciate <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin 's</COREF> idyllic natural setting .
The local people have formed a fish conservation team and as a result the Peishih River is now protected *-1 .
Many prized species of Taiwanese fish are being propagated *-1 .
In the pristine forests are *T*-1 ancient pine forests with species unique to <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and the deep blue skies attract waves of students to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> *PRO* to camp out and observe the stars .
The calloused hands of <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the tea growers</COREF> are steeped *-1 with the vitality of tea .
Last year <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin 's</COREF> Pouchong tea earned the " Presidential Seal . "

*PRO* So , next time 0 you go to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pinglin</COREF> *T*-1 , please do n't just treat <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as a quick pitstop .
