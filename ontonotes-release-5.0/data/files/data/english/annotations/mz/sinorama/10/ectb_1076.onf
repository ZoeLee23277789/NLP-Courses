    If they 're afraid that the new expressway will bring hordes of people and pollute the water resources, then what they
    should do, within reasonable bounds, is allow the people here to build public facilities for visitors which will help
    minimise their impact on the local ecology, for example public toilets and comprehensive rubbish disposal.
