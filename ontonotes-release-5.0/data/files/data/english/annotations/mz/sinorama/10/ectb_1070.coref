The Bible says : " If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed , you will say to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">this mountain</COREF> , ' *PRO* Move hence to yonder place , ' and <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will move ; and nothing will be impossible to you . "
For small as <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the mustard seed</COREF> is *?* , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> grows into a mighty , spreading tree .
*PRO* Applying <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">these words</COREF> to <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> most aptly describe the <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> red cypress , whose tiny seeds *T*-1 are the origin of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> greatest trees .
From conelets three millimeters in diameter come *T*-1 <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">seeds no larger than sesame seeds</COREF> , yet <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> grow into huge trees up to 60 meters tall .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> red cypress</COREF> witnessed <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> birth , squeezed * up by the collision of two tectonic plates , and <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> progress from a fragile mass of broken rock to a more stable geology .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has also witnessed the rise and fall of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> forestry industry .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="109" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsiuluan Village</COREF> , <COREF ID="109" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an Atayal community in eastern Hsinchu County</COREF></COREF> , was one of the last places in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> 0 *T*-1 to be reached *-1 by modern civilization , and was once famous as the " village without lights . "
In <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the mountain forest above <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Hsiuluan 's</COREF> outlying hamlet of Chenhsipao</COREF> , bushes and creepers form a dense undergrowth , and a blanket of damp fallen leaves makes the going slippery underfoot .
Every ten to 20 meters , a magnificent <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> red cypress , thousands of years old and with a trunk three to four meters thick , towers 40 meters into the sky .
<COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-000-E4" TYPE="IDENT">Awe - stricken hikers standing below these great trees</COREF> have the impression of *PRO* having fallen into a sea of jungle , from which <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-000-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can barely see the sky *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">This remnant of virgin cypress forest</COREF> runs northward to <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">Taoyuan County 's</COREF> Mt. Lala and to Chilan in <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-000-E5" TYPE="IDENT">Ilan County</COREF> .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">This great wall of trees</COREF> acts as a vital " safety valve , " regulating the flow of water into the Shihmen Reservoir , the Tanshui River and the Lanyang River , on which <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">millions of people in northern <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> depend *T*-1 for the water 0 <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> drink *T*-2 .
The coat of green which *T*-1 clothes the mountains intimately affects water quality and soil stability in <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">Taoyuan</COREF> , Hsinchu , Miaoli and <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-000-E5" TYPE="IDENT">Ilan</COREF> Counties .

At <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">these elevations</COREF> there is much rainfall but relatively little wind , and <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-001-E12" TYPE="IDENT">the mountains</COREF> are shrouded *-1 in clouds and mists all year round ; hence <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-001-E16" TYPE="IDENT">the forests there</COREF> are also known *-2 as cloud forests .
In this environment of constant humidity , the Taiwan red cypress grew into East Asia 's biggest conifer , with average heights from 30 to 40 meters .
<COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-001-E16" TYPE="IDENT">The cypress forests</COREF> also mark the transition between <COREF ID="ectb_1070-part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> broadleaved and coniferous forests .

<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The devastating 21 September earthquake of 1999</COREF> left <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> landscape *PRO* covered *-1 in scars , but researchers discovered that the places least damaged * by <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the quake</COREF> were areas of natural forest .
In mountain regions where the rainfall is most abundant , the geology most fragile and erosive forces most powerful *T*-1 , <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the false cypresses , with <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> massive trunks and mighty root systems</COREF> , cling tightly to the frail earth .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Professor Chen Yu - feng of Providence University , who *T*-1 has been studying <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> flora for many years</COREF> , explains that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">false cypress forests</COREF> often grew where river erosion created <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-002-E3" TYPE="IDENT">large areas of debris from rockslides</COREF> *T*-2 .
As tectonic forces pushed <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> continuously upwards and <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the rivers</COREF> carved <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way downward , such areas of collapse occurred in many places .
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Doughty false cypress seeds</COREF> seized the opportunity *PRO* to colonize <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-002-E3" TYPE="IDENT">this hostile territory shunned * by other plants</COREF> .
There <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> gradually grew into <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">gigantic trees</COREF> , *PRO*-1 rehabilitating the land and attracting other species .
At the same time <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> protected <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">downstream areas</COREF> , *PRO*-1 making <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> suitable for settlement and farming .
" The growth of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the cypress forests</COREF> stabilized the rubble brought * down by the rushing mountain rivers .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">The false cypresses</COREF> are living ' spirits ' which *T*-1 naturally restore the land , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Yu - feng</COREF> .
For the past million years , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">clouds rolling in on northeasterly monsoon fronts in winter and southwesterly airflows in summer</COREF> have carried <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> moisture into the mountain valleys , *PRO*-2 to slowly condense onto the slopes where <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the false cypresses</COREF> grow *T*-1 .
*PRO*-1 Steeped * in this dampness , the flora and fauna of the forest continued an unending cycle of growth and renewal through the changing seasons .

The nemesis of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the cypress trees</COREF>
However , the advent of mechanization , coupled * with human greed , heralded a period of rapacious exploitation .
In the 19th century human beings swarmed into <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> dark mountains like busy worker ants .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The false cypresses , which *T*-1 had conversed with the clouds for a million years</COREF> , were identified *-2 as top - grade timber , and were thus condemned *-2 to an inexorable fate .
After <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was ceded *-1 to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> *PRO* following the Sino - Japanese war of 1894 , while <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese</COREF> were still quelling resistance to <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rule <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> also went into <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the island 's</COREF> mountains</COREF> *PRO*-2 to collect botanical specimens .
In 1896 , a Japanese biologist collected the first specimen of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> red cypress on Yushan , and before long the <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> yellow cypress was found *-1 there too .
In 1899 , the great cypress forests of Mt. Ali were discovered *-1 , and in 1912 , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese colonial government</COREF> began large - scale logging there .
Everywhere <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the Alishan Mountain Railway</COREF> passes at higher elevations *T*-1 was once cypress forest .
Soon afterwards the forests of Mt. Taiping in modern Ilan County and Mt. Pahsien in Nantou were also opened *-1 up for logging .
Endless streams of cypress logs flowed out of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the mountains</COREF> , and were carried *-1 across the sea to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> *PRO*-1 to become pillars for Shinto shrines .
Quite apart from the incomparable quality of <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> timber , in terms of numbers alone <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> red and yellow cypress</COREF> took second and third place among <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> trees , so <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> became long - term cash cows for <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the island 's</COREF> forestry industry</COREF> .
After <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> return to Chinese rule , from the 1950s to the 1980s <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the ROC</COREF> used forestry income *PRO*-1 to support <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> industrial development .
The logging grounds advanced deep into <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> heart , *PRO*-1 consuming even greater areas than under <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese</COREF> .
False cypresses accounted for two - thirds of the 300,000 hectares of commercial forest , and contributed 70 - 80 % of forestry income .
All of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> forest recreation areas today are *PRO*-1 to be found *-1 in the former cypress logging grounds .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">The Alishan Mountain Railway</COREF> , and the long forestry roads which *T*-1 wind through <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> four major mountain ranges , were all built *-2 for the sole purpose of *PRO* shifting the huge cypress logs down the slopes .
" You could say that everything connected * with <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> forestry industry</COREF> developed around <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the false cypresses</COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="154" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">forest ecologist Yang Kuo - chen</COREF> , <COREF ID="154" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an associate professor at Providence University</COREF></COREF> .

<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="ectb_1070-part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> yellow and red cypress</COREF> each have <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own different qualities .
The <COREF ID="ectb_1070-part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> yellow cypress grows pencil - straight towards the heavens , and has a higher content of oil , from which a fragrant essence can be refined *-1 *T*-2 .
In 1971 , after the <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-004-E6" TYPE="IDENT">Shinto</COREF> gate at the Meiji Shrine in Tokyo was struck *-1 by lightning , the Japanese authorities especially came to <COREF ID="ectb_1070-part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *PRO*-2 to buy 11 huge , straight <COREF ID="ectb_1070-part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> yellow cypress logs 16 to 24 meters long , cut * from trees over 1,500 years old , *PRO*-2 to create the world 's biggest <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-004-E6" TYPE="IDENT">Shinto</COREF> gate .

But <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-004-E12" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwan red cypress 's</COREF> trunk is often divided *-1 , and because <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-004-E12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> mostly grows in wet river valleys the heartwood is prone *PRO*-2 to be eaten *-2 away by bacteria , *PRO* producing strangely tangled hollow trees .

<COREF ID="ectb_1070-part-004-E4" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is why the gigantic ancient trees that *T*-1 have escaped the loggers ' chainsaws , such as those at Mt. Ali and Mt. Lala , are all Taiwan red cypress *T*-2 .
Human life is fleeting , but cypress is forever .
As the forestry industry gradually declined , the forestry huts built * in the Central Range in the Japanese period fell into disrepair , but <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">their cypress - wood washbasins</COREF> are still as good as new .
The close grain of <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> growth rings reveals <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> age , and <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> resilience .
In the early days , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the sleepers used * for the Alishan Mountain Railway</COREF> were cut *-1 from broadleaved trees such as <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">beech and Michelia compressa</COREF> .
But tough as <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">these woods</COREF> are *?* , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the sleepers</COREF> only stood up to three to five years of logging trains rumbling over <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , so there was no choice but *PRO* to change <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> all for <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-004-E15" TYPE="IDENT">sleepers made * of false cypress wood , which *T*-2 lasted for decades</COREF> .

For the older generation , the excellence of false cypress wood is hard 0 *PRO* to put *T*-1 into words .

*PRO* Pining away
However , behind these sweet memories of cypress wood are *T*-1 the regrets of the foresters .
Surveys made * before logging began at <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mt.

Despite <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> great fame , *PRO*-1 deprived * of the company of <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own species <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the most celebrated of the giant <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> red cypresses of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Mt.

<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The TFB</COREF> once hoped that if <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">a few false cypresses</COREF> were left *-1 *PRO*-1 standing in each of the old logging areas , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would seed naturally .
But <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> discovered that although <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the trees</COREF> were completely uninjured , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> died one by one .
Late Taiwanese forestry expert Liu Chin described <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">these few remaining trees</COREF> as " *PRO* dying of loneliness . "
It seems that when *PRO* abandoned * by the companions 0 <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had relied on *T*-2 for millennia , and left *PRO* to face the rigors of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> environment alone *T*-3 , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">these ancient survivors</COREF> went into terminal decline .

<COREF ID="ectb_1070-part-005-E1" TYPE="IDENT">This devastation</COREF> , coupled * with agriculture moving up into the mountains , can only result in landslides , floods and all kinds of ' natural ' disasters . . . . "
With ecologists ' warnings ringing in <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ears , now that floods and mudslides have become a common occurrence , <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> can only nod in tacit agreement .
Large - scale logging of false cypresses continued right up to 1989 .
With forestry earning no profits , and in response to energetic lobbying by civic groups , the Executive Yuan finally banned the cutting of natural forests , *PRO* at last giving a respite to the giant trees which *T*-1 protect <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> land .
But the great wall of 20 million gigantic false cypress trees which *T*-1 once stretched the length of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> had already been breached *-2 .
Apart from some scattered local stands , the <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> red cypress forest of Mt. Hsiukulan in central Taiwan , and the 10,000 - plus hectares of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> yellow cypress at Mt. Chilan in Ilan County in northern Taiwan , are <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the island 's</COREF> only remaining forests of giant trees .

Whose national park ?
Humans cut down <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the million year - old cypress forests</COREF> in less than a century , but the story of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> destruction is not over .
Amazingly , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the ban on *PRO* logging natural forests</COREF> has not protected <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chilan</COREF> , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the only single - species forest of hinoki cypress surviving in the world today</COREF></COREF> .
Before <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the ban</COREF> , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Vocational Assistance Commission for Retired Servicemen -LRB- VACRS -RRB- , which *T*-1 manages <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Chilan</COREF></COREF> , had already cut down almost 6,000 hectares .
*PRO*-1 To generate income , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">VACRS</COREF> has continued *-1 logging there under the pretext of " *PRO* clearing away dead and fallen trees *PRO* to make space for young trees to grow . "
Ecologists and biologists can only repeat again :
" <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">The trees</COREF> have been growing by <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> for tens of thousands of years , so why would <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need human help for <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> saplings to grow *T*-1 ? "
In response to this situation a popular movement *ICH*-3 sprang up *PRO* to push for the establishment of a " cypress forest national park , " in the hope that with national park status , the last remaining virgin <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> yellow cypress forest could be saved *-2 .
Perhaps the millennium year was a decisive one for <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the trees</COREF> , for the Executive Yuan allocated new funds to <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the VACRS</COREF> so that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> no longer needs *-1 to cut down trees *PRO*-1 to bolster <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> finances , and also approved a plan *PRO* to set up <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">a national park</COREF> .
But so - called ecotourism is now emerging as another threat to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the trees '</COREF> survival .
*PRO* To assure the livelihood of the local Atayal aborigines of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Chilan</COREF> , when <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the cypress national park</COREF> is set *-2 up *T*-1 consideration will have *-3 to be given *-3 to how *PRO* to balance the need *PRO* to protect the forests with the demand for sustainable tourism *T*-4 .
How can <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> false cypresses become more than just a tool of human economic activity *T*-1 ?
Can the sad history of cypress logging teach <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> a lesson in how *PRO* to truly care for <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> land *T*-1 ?
Perhaps these questions are still more important than the issue of *PRO* establishing a national park .

A future for the cypresses ?
At the Atayal village of Chenhsipao in Hsinchu County , by three in the afternoon the clouds rolling in from afar have quietly slipped over the ridges and covered the whole mountainside where the cypress trees grow *T*-1 .
Here , in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> remote but vitally important heartland , gigantic trees which *T*-1 have survived the long river of time and escaped the ravages of logging stand *PRO*-2 undaunted , like guardian spirits quietly protecting the Atayal people and <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> land .
Only if <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-007-E2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can allow the cypress trees a future , will <COREF ID="ectb_1070.part-007-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> also have a lasting future .

This <COREF ID="ectb_1070-part-008-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> red cypress planted * by the Japanese at Mt. Ali in 1915 has now reached a girth of 70 centimeters .
But the smallest commercial size of <COREF ID="ectb_1070-part-008-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> red cypress is 150 centimeters .
This means that <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">artificially planted trees</COREF> are not ready for harvest until <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are 300 years old .
Hence since the false cypress forests were cleared *-1 , Taiwanese - *PRO*-3 preferring quick profits - have generally planted Japanese red cedar , which *T*-2 is ready *PRO*-2 to be felled *-2 after only 20 years .
