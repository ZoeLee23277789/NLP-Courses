    If clothes in Taiwan today are getting ever lighter, softer, warmer, more wrinkle-free and easier to keep clean, and if
    their colors are bright, fresh and stain-resistant, this is not thanks to the magic wand wielded by Cinderella's fairy
    godmother, but is the result of the unceasing efforts towards research, development and upgrading put in by the textile
    industry over the years.
