" <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">MP3</COREF> is fine when you 're using <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with earphones *T*-1 , but if you try *PRO*-2 to play <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> through speakers , the bass just disappears .
CDs are much better . "
Recently <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> released a mini disc that *T*-1 can be used *-1 with MP3 players or PDAs that *T*-2 has attracted great attention on the market .
But in the view of <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="146" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Yeh Chin - tai</COREF> , <COREF ID="146" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek 's</COREF> CEO</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-000-E9" TYPE="IDENT">MP3</COREF> is little more than a toy for kids .
<COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-000-E9" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's simply not good enough for more discriminating audiophiles .
Optoelectronics is seemingly the exclusive province of the new " technobility , " in which case <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Yeh Chin - tai</COREF> , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a plastics entrepreneur and manufacturer of phonograph records</COREF></COREF> , breaks the mold *T*-1 .
At the age of 60 , <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> created <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek , which *T*-1 is now the world 's largest manufacturer of CD - ROMs , *PRO* shipping 2 billion a year</COREF> .
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">This old technologist , now 73</COREF> , has been a key behind - the - scenes player in *PRO* bringing high - quality products to the world 's audiophiles and videophiles .

Almost all of the musicians on hand for the launch had heard of <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> , but very few knew that <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was the CEO of <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="215" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ritek</COREF> , <COREF ID="215" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a company worth billions of NT dollars</COREF></COREF> .
Treasure amid black plastic
Before *PRO* founding <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> , <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> was already a well - known figure in <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-000-E6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> recording industry</COREF> .
In the 1960s , <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu Tsang - houei</COREF> , Shih Wei - liang and other musicians</COREF> labored hard at *PRO* making <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">collections of Taiwanese folk songs</COREF> , but <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were n't able *PRO* to release <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
It was n't until 1979 , when <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu</COREF> delivered an impassioned speech *ICH*-1 at the Sanchung Rotary Club about <COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT">this problem</COREF> *T*-2 , that <COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> struck a chord with someone who *T*-4 could do something about <COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-3 .
At that time <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh Chin - tai</COREF> was CEO of First Records , which *T*-1 subsequently released <COREF ID="269" TYPE="IDENT">a series of 21 albums , including recordings of Hakka eight tone , Fujian ten tone , Hengchun - style sing - and - tell , and so forth</COREF> .
<COREF ID="269" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was the best collection of Taiwanese folk music ever made * .
Although <COREF ID="269" TYPE="IDENT">the series</COREF> , as *PRO* expected , did n't make any money , for three years running <COREF ID="269" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> won <COREF ID="289" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Golden Tripod</COREF> , <COREF ID="289" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-000-E6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> highest music award</COREF> .
" It 's not that <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm especially fond of music or culture , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> , who *T*-2 studied engineering in the last Japanese - era class of what *T*-3 became the National Taipei Institute of Technology .
" But <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> work in the recording industry brought <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> into contact with Peking opera , beiguan and nanguan music , and so forth .
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> felt that those recordings were very educational and ought *-1 to be preserved *-1 . "
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> still regrets that <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't have video equipment , so <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could n't also make video records of folk music performances .
Back in the early 1950s <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">the 24 - year - old Yeh</COREF> worked with the Broadcasting Corporation of China *PRO*-1 to record albums of BCC singers on equipment 0 the Japanese army had left *T*-2 behind .
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> became a major player in the Taipei music industry .
" We recorded <COREF ID="344" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="347" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Tzu Wei 's first record</COREF> , <COREF ID="347" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Green Island Tune</COREF></COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> , half closing <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> eyes as <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> recalls those days .
" Who *T*-1 would have thought 0 <COREF ID="344" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would still be popular today ? "
Later <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> established <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">the Platinum Music recording studio</COREF> and went abroad *PRO*-1 to keep up on the latest industry trends .
*PRO*-2 The first 0 *T*-1 to bring multi-track stereo recording to Taiwan , <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made a big contribution toward raising standards in <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">the recording industry here</COREF> .
<COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">Platinum</COREF> is still going , *PRO*-1 run * by senior recording engineer Yeh Chui - Ching , who *T*-2 is <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh Chin - tai 's</COREF> oldest son .
<COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is still one of <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-000-E6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> leading studios , *PRO*-1 having recorded such chart toppers as Luo Ta - yu 's " The Small Town Lukang " and Wang Chieh 's " A Game , a Dream , " as well as recent works by Chen Shan - ni .

Cigarette cases and plastic milk bottles
Although <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh Chin - tai</COREF> has worked in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the recording industry</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> field is really plastics and machinery .
After *PRO* graduating from college , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> opened <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the Mingli Plastics Factory</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> first product was a plastic cigarette case .
Back in those days <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">farmers</COREF> would always put <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">cigarettes</COREF> in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> pockets when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> went to the fields *T*-1 , but <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would often find that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cigarettes</COREF> would get crushed *-2 before <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had a chance *PRO* to smoke <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Both <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the cases</COREF> and the machines 0 *T*-1 to make <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> sold well all over Taiwan .
*PRO*-3 Noting that glass baby bottles often cracked when *PRO* boiled * for sterilization *T*-2 , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> then came up with the idea of *PRO* replacing glass with polyethylene .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> factory</COREF> was the first in the world 0 *T*-2 to produce plastic baby bottles .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> also made the sterilizers , and both lines proved *-1 to be very profitable .
In was in this period that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> met <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-001-E6" TYPE="IDENT">the owner of the factory across from <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> , who *T*-2 was a National Assembly member</COREF> *T*-1 .
Through <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-001-E6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> reestablished connections with BCC and once again threw <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> into <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the recording industry</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> recalls a " beautiful accident " : <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> bought a second - hand electroplater from a Japanese and tried *PRO*-1 to plate <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">various plastic products</COREF> with chrome so as *PRO* to make <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> more resilient .
Only after repeated failures and much frustration did <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> think about *PRO* <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-001-E2" TYPE="IDENT">electroplating</COREF> <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> black plastic albums</COREF> with nickel and copper *PRO* to make <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> stronger .
<COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-001-E2" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> thrust <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> into the realm of media storage .
" The times change faster with each wave , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> explains that it *EXP*-2 took 100 years after Edison invented phonograph records for <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-001-E8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">something better</COREF> - <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-001-E8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">laser disks</COREF> -</COREF> to appear .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> replacements , CDs and VCDs *ICH*-3 , are now cresting , 0 *T*-1 soon to be vanquished *-1 by <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">DVDs , which *T*-2 though next in line are already feeling mini-disks closing in on <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> .

Global CD - ROM wars
*PRO* Competing in the information age , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> has seen industries rise and fall .
*PRO*-1 Resilient and flexible , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> never recoils from challenges .
Back when <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">CDs</COREF> were still in <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> infancy *T*-1 , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> relied on <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> old relationship with Sony and found <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">a team of engineers associated * with the Industrial Technology Research Institute</COREF> before <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made a push into CD production .
*PRO*-2 Starting from simple pieces of compressed plastic , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> went one step at a time , *PRO*-2 building a sturdy foundation of technical knowledge that <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> still enjoys *T*-1 today .
In 1990 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> started *-1 to press CDs , *PRO*-1 becoming the first mass - production manufacturer of CDs in Taiwan .
Back then , it cost Japanese manufacturers about NT$ 80 *U* *PRO* to press one CD .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> garnered market share by *PRO* undercutting the competition and charging only NT$ 50 *U* .
With the support that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> had long enjoyed *T*-1 in the recording industry here , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> was easily able *PRO* to market <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> goods .
What *T*-1 really brought <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> into the realm of high - technology was *PRO* developing <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-002-E8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own CD - Rs</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-002-E8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">recordable CDs</COREF> -RRB- .
*PRO*-2 Taking a different tack from the Japanese , who *T*-1 were plating <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-002-E3" TYPE="IDENT">CD - Rs</COREF> with a thin gold layer , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> instead developed a cheap and high - quality process for *PRO* coating <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-002-E3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> with silver or aluminum .
These allowed for a much lower price that *T*-1 in turn created more demand .
It is yet another example of a Taiwanese company starting a global price war .

*PRO* Marching forward
*PRO* <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Being</COREF> competitive in terms of price is one of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek 's</COREF> strong points , but <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not the whole story behind <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> success .
Another important factor is that at key moments <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> has not hesitated *PRO*-1 to invest the necessary sums when it *EXP*-2 was necessary *PRO* to bring the technology to the next level *T*-3 .
" Ten years ago , when <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> first started *-3 producing CDs *T*-1 , one machine required five or six persons *PRO* to operate , " <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> recalls *T*-2 .
" When a flood of orders came in *T*-1 , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'd have everyone working overtime with shifts going around the clock , but <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> still were n't able *PRO* to keep up with demand .
That 's when <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the workers</COREF> took the initiative 0 *T*-2 to suggest that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> automate *T*-1 . "
Now <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">everything from ordering and production to storage and shipping</COREF> is computerized *-1 .
One person is typically responsible for about 10 machines .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The whole process</COREF> has been shortened *-1 , and quality is high .
The amount that the same 3,000 workers can produce *T*-1 has exploded from 200,000 a month to 200 million a month .
Automation has meant that <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the workers</COREF> have had *-1 to learn how *PRO* to operate sophisticated machinery and computers , so that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> has advanced out of the ranks of the traditional plastic disc pressers *T*-2 .
Automation has also allowed <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> to lower costs at a time when the price of data storage media has been plummeting *T*-1 .
In the third quarter last year , the price of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">a CD - ROM</COREF> suddenly fell from 60 US cents to 40 cents , which *T*-2 is n't far from the 30 cents 0 <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> costs *T*-1 *PRO* to make *?* .
It 's a long way from the US$ 14 *U* that <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-003-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> cost *T*-1 when <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-003-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> first hit the market five years ago *T*-2 .
Yet <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> has still managed *PRO*-1 to maintain operating profits of 22 % , and the falling prices have n't crushed <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .

The coming wave of technology will focus on light and small portable data devices such as PDAs and MP3 players , so the challenge for <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> is allowing devices that *T*-1 are becoming smaller and smaller to have larger data capacities and higher fidelity .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> points out that the patent rights for <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">mini-discs</COREF> are owned *-1 entirely by big Japanese companies , but <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> is the only company manufacturing <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> is also part of a group -LRB- which *T*-1 includes Dataplay , Samsung and Toshiba -RRB- that *T*-2 is researching and developing <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">a data storage device no larger than a wrist watch</COREF> , as well as the applications for <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> will be responsible for the production of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the disk</COREF> .
A year and a half ago <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> invested in the production of <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-004-E11" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">OLED</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-004-E11" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">organic light - emitting diode</COREF> -RRB- displays , which *T*-1 is yet another technology used * in portable computing devices that *T*-2 relies on thin opto - electrical film application techniques .
Currently <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> is the largest producer of OLEDs in the world .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> has also begun *-1 to explore fiber optics used * in the information industry .
Last year <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Ritek</COREF> invested in production of <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">fiber - optic connectors</COREF> with <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan Memory Technology</COREF> .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> one of the products 0 <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> is proudest of *T*-1 .
" In the future , when fiber optic applications mature *T*-1 , a house will need a dozen or so of <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">these connectors</COREF> , " <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> says *T*-2 .
Currently , the fiber optic connectors being produced * by <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">TMT</COREF> sell for US$ 7 *U* a piece .
But <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ca n't keep up with demand , so <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> has gone to the mainland *ICH*-2 *PRO*-1 to establish more factories , where <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has cast <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> eyes upon the vast mainland market *T*-3 .
On the topic of fiber optics and the internet , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> is particularly knowledgeable and incisive .
Whenever <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> goes to <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> happily brings back lots of <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese books about economics and technology , such as those about third - generation mobile phones , hand - held devices and so forth</COREF> .
" <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> study <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">the concepts presented * in <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">these books</COREF></COREF> , and then <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> use the viewpoint of a businessman *PRO*-1 to see if there would be any problems *PRO* implementing <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Yeh</COREF> has a house full of Japanese books and reads Japanese newspapers every day .
*PRO*-1 Working hard *PRO*-1 to get a grip on technological trends , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> believes that only the far - sighted will end up *-2 winners .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> often cites the example of <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-004-E6" TYPE="IDENT">the owner of <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-004-E7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Japanese fast food chain</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1054.part-004-E7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Yoshinoya</COREF></COREF> , who *T*-1 predicted as early as 1980 , when there was a great US - <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> trade imbalance *T*-2 , that <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-004-E3" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> would force <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> *PRO*-3 to open <COREF ID="ectb_1054-part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> beef market</COREF> .
