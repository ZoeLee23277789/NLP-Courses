A Date with Destiny -- Presidential Candidates Woo the Voters
Four years ago , amidst the tense atmosphere of <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the first - ever direct elections for the nation 's leader in Chinese history</COREF> , issues of ethnicity and ideology became focal points .
The crisis sparked * by <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">PRC</COREF> missile tests pushed the security of <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> to the top of the issue list , and the ticket of Lee Teng - hui and <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chan</COREF> of the ruling Kuomintang , which *T*-1 promised stability , won <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> with 54 % of the vote .
In <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">this year 's</COREF> presidential election , cross-strait policy is still an important subject .
But none of <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">the five candidates</COREF> is advocating <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> independence , and , among <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the three main contenders</COREF> , there is a race for the center .
<COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">All three</COREF> have proposed ideas 0 *PRO* to maintain peace and stability in <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwan Strait</COREF> *T*-1 :
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chan</COREF> has proposed a " <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan Strait</COREF> zone of peace , " James Soong has advocated the signing of a peace treaty with <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> , and <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> has announced that if *PRO* elected * <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will not declare <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> independent nor seek *PRO*-3 to have the " two states formula " inserted *-4 in the constitution .
In 1996 , <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">President Lee Teng - hui</COREF> was far ahead of <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> rivals all the way , and the election was lopsided .
<COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">This year</COREF> , the most prominent feature of the campaign is exactly the opposite :
<COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">The three main candidates</COREF> are running neck - and - neck , and the election battle is fierce .
It *EXP*-1 is impossible right now *PRO* to say who *T*-2 might win , and will probably remain so right up to the finish .
With <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">all the candidates</COREF> having largely similar views on cross-strait relations , what issues *T*-1 will be decisive ?
Candidates can play <COREF ID="238" TYPE="IDENT">the stability card , the bull - market card , the serve - the - people card , the personal charisma card , and so on</COREF> , but which one of <COREF ID="238" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> *T*-2 will prove *-2 to be the trump card ?
*PRO*-1 Taking advantage of <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese New Year</COREF> , <COREF ID="253" TYPE="IDENT">many <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> businessmen working in <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF></COREF> returned to <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *PRO*-1 to spend <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">the holiday</COREF> with <COREF ID="253" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> families .
Just after the new year , <COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">the Mainland Affairs Council and several non-governmental groups</COREF> co-sponsored <COREF ID="264" TYPE="IDENT">a seminar on economic relations with <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="261" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> invited <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">a number of <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> businessmen who *T*-2 were among the earliest 0 *T*-3 to invest in <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-1 to come to <COREF ID="264" TYPE="IDENT">the seminar</COREF> and relate <COREF ID="270" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> experiences .
At <COREF ID="264" TYPE="IDENT">this event</COREF> , there was virtually no mention of the election .
<COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">The participants</COREF> were far more concerned about *PRO* choosing investment sites , hiring mainland personnel , and understanding customs regulations .
You could privately ask <COREF ID="287" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> : Is there likely * to be any change in the cross-strait situation after <COREF ID="299" TYPE="IDENT">the election of a new leader</COREF> ?
Will <COREF ID="299" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> affect willingness *PRO* to invest in <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> ?
But you would only get responses like : " *PRO* Let 's not talk politics , " or " Everyone is seeking stability , and there wo n't be much of a change . "
Most of the businessmen expressed optimism that after the entry of <COREF ID="325" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> and <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> into the World Trade Organization later this year , relations between <COREF ID="325" TYPE="IDENT">the two sides</COREF> would steadily improve .

A terrifying topic ?
*PRO* Maintaining peaceful relations across the Taiwan Strait is the common hope of the vast majority of the people of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
When you talk about 21st century leadership in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">cross-strait policy</COREF> is the most serious subject that politicians must face *T*-2 , because <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> involves the very survival of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
" However , because <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">this subject</COREF> touches on the question of the ' loyalty ' of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the candidates</COREF> toward <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has become a terrifying topic for <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wang Chien - chuang</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president of The Journalist magazine and a longtime observer of political development in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
By *PRO* looking at the carefully worded statements of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the various candidates</COREF> , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *?* , it *EXP*-1 is clear that <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are all afraid of *PRO* being accused * of *PRO* " selling out <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> . "
The only exception is <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the fringe candidate Li Ao , who *T*-1 is well - known for *PRO* shooting from the hip</COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Unafraid of criticism that <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is " betraying <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , " <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has publicly endorsed the PRC 's policy of " one country , two systems . "
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The other minor candidate</COREF> , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsu Hsin - liang</COREF></COREF> , set the foundations for <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mainland policy as early as ten years ago when <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wrote a book on <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> theory of a " newly rising people *T*-1 . "
But neither of these views conform to mainstream values , and these candidates are getting little support .

<TEXT PARTNO="002">
What about <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the three main candidates</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian of the Democratic Progressive Party , which *T*-1 advocates <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> independence</COREF> , produced a long and detailed white paper on <COREF ID="ectb_1013-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> policy , which *T*-2 offered some changes and reservations to the independence position .
But , in an unguarded moment , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> also declared " Long live <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> independent sovereignty ! " and this comment has left many people *PRO*-2 uncertain which *T*-1 is the real Chen .
Independent candidate
James Soong has suggested <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">defining</COREF> <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> - <COREF ID="ectb_1013-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">PRC</COREF> links as a " quasi-international relationship . "
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> aims for a middle ground between <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT 's</COREF> " two states formula "</COREF> and <COREF ID="ectb_1013-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC 's</COREF> " one country , two systems " that *T*-1 will appeal to <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="ectb_1013-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> , and the international community .
But this idea has been criticized *-1 for *PRO* unilaterally reducing <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> to the status of a " quasi-country , " *PRO* thereby weakening <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> status and bargaining power vis - a - vis <COREF ID="ectb_1013-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lien Chan</COREF> , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">candidate of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the ruling KMT</COREF></COREF></COREF> , is somewhat bound *PRO*-1 to support <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's " two states formula</COREF> . "
After much consideration , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mainland policy has been framed *-1 as *PRO* working toward the middle stage of the National Reunification Guidelines - in other words , attempting *PRO* to re-establish official channels of communication between the two sides of the strait .
" No one <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">dares</COREF> *PRO*-1 be different from the others on mainland policy , " says *T*-2 Wang Chien - chuang .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is because over the past few years <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">a consensus</COREF> *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 has taken shape in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> society on policy toward <COREF ID="ectb_1013-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> : " <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> first . "
No one has the ability *PRO* to alter <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">this consensus</COREF> .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The candidates</COREF> can merely haggle over details of policy , such as differences over the scope or timing of liberalization of <COREF ID="109" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the " three direct links "</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="109" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">direct trade , direct transport , and direct mail</COREF> -RRB- .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="114" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Alexander Lu</COREF> , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a professor of political science at National Taiwan University</COREF></COREF> , agrees with the no - major - innovations approach of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the three candidates</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> sees it , since currently there are three candidates with a roughly equal share of the vote , whoever *T*-1 wins will probably not get more than 50 % .
As a result , there will be a great deal of countervailing pressure against radical change .
Concludes *ICH*-2 <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Lu</COREF> : " Policy will tend *-1 to be centrist , and any steps taken * will be small . "
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> adds , " <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is a pluralistic society , and if you want *PRO*-1 to attract many types of voters , you ca n't be too outspoken about policy .
This is because <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">extreme clarity</COREF> does n't make much difference to those who *T*-1 already support you , but <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could cost you undecided votes . "

Local issues , national results
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Mainland policy</COREF> is a minefield , but <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is the foundation for all other policies , and no candidate can ignore <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
However , this does not mean , say *?* <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> and Lu , that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be a decisive factor in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> .
" There is a very curious aspect to <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> electoral culture , " explains *T*-1 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is small , and voters do not clearly distinguish between the roles of the head of state , elected legislators , and government bureaucrats .
No matter how high the office *?* *T*-1 , for <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">many voters , especially in traditional constituencies</COREF> , " all politics is local . "
For <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , what *T*-1 matters <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> whether a politician seems *-2 concerned about <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hometown issues .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is why when <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> went to Sanhsia in Taipei County *T*-2 , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> talked about a pension for the elderly , and when <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chan</COREF> went to Kaohsiung *T*-1 <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> talked about *PRO* establishing a science - based industrial park there *T*-3 .
These parochial issues are the real keys to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF> .
Next in importance is *T*-1 the candidate 's character , including charisma , leadership style , and attitude in *PRO* dealing with incidents that *T*-2 come up during the campaign .
In this campaign , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">James Soong</COREF> has been at the center of much controversy over the character issue .
The issues that *T*-1 surround <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> can be traced *-2 back to <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> more than two decades near the top in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> political life .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Kuo Shu - min of the China Times Express</COREF> , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a longtime observer of <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT</COREF></COREF></COREF> , says that controversy over <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">James Soong</COREF> goes back to the days when <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT</COREF> ruled over <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and repressed all opposition *T*-1 .
When <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Soong</COREF> was <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">KMT</COREF> secretary - general *T*-1 , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was powerful and aloof ; the only way 0 *PRO* to get an interview with <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-2 was *PRO* to block <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> car</COREF> as <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> left party headquarters .
During the struggle in <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT</COREF> between the mainstream and the non-mainstream factions , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Soong</COREF> played a vital role in *PRO* consolidating the position of <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">President Lee Teng - hui</COREF> .
In *PRO* clearing out many obstacles on behalf of <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> incurred the wrath of many party elders , who *T*-1 considered <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to be <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Lee 's</COREF> " running dog . "
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Soong</COREF> is especially good at timing .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> knows what *PRO* to say *T*-1 and when , in order *PRO* to attract the most attention .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Kuo</COREF> recalls several such opportune moments when <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Soong</COREF> was provincial governor *T*-1 .
For example , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> criticized the <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">KMT</COREF> center over the symbolic status assigned * to the provincial governor at cabinet meetings , and also over unfairness in the division of government revenues .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> media skills were such that " <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> only had *-1 to open <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mouth and <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be the headline on page one or two . "
Although opinions *ICH*-2 are divided *-1 about <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Soong</COREF> , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Kuo</COREF> affirms one thing :
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has had *-3 to be very determined in order *PRO* to transform <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> image from that of a skilled party infighter from a high - ranking family to that of a populist who *T*-4 understands the people .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Kuo</COREF> , " If <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Teng - hui</COREF> is a Taiwanese opera performer , then <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">James Soong</COREF> is a Peking opera actor - <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Soong 's</COREF> moves are refined *-2 down to the last detail . "
For example , when <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT</COREF> was trying *PRO*-1 to persuade <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">elder National Assembly members</COREF> *PRO*-2 to retire *T*-3 , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Soong</COREF> met with <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">them all</COREF> individually .
During <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> five years as governor , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> visited each of the 309 towns and rural townships in <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this presidential election</COREF> , at any event with a crowd , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to shake the hand of everyone there ; <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> believes that <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can tell from the handshake alone whether <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has that person 's vote .

Gold cup and plain water
In contrast to Soong and Chen Shui - bian , who *T*-1 have been through previous election battles and have distinct public identities , " <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chan</COREF> is n't really a man of the people .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> does n't like *PRO*-1 to have the spotlight on <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't think of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> as a star , and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't want *PRO*-2 to put on a show . "
But , says *?* <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Chien - chuang</COREF> , it *EXP*-1 is debatable whether a politician really needs *-2 to have the common touch .
*PRO* Compare <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> to the US .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Teng - hui</COREF> is similar to Bill Clinton , who *T*-1 has a personal charisma that *T*-2 moves people .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chan</COREF> , on the other hand , is more like Al Gore , and has always been somewhat aloof from average citizens .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Chien - chuang</COREF> , " <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chan</COREF> is like plain water in a gold cup . "
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's been in government for more than 20 years , *PRO*-1 serving as minister of transportation and communications , foreign minister , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> provincial governor , premier , and vice president .
" Yet still most citizens do not have a very strong impression of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
This is really a strange situation . "
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen Feng - hsin</COREF> , <COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a reporter for the United Daily News</COREF> , writes in <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the authorized biography</COREF> <COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">100 % Lien Chan</COREF></COREF> that a large part of the reason 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> appears *-2 to be unapproachable *T*-1 is because of the way 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has come across on TV *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> says that , after more than 20 years in appointive positions , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has developed a stern mien .
Moreover , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> appearances on television have often been at confrontational interpellation sessions in front of the legislature or the provincial assembly , so that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> warmer side does not come across .
A little story in <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> relates something of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> sense of humor .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> was born *-1 in Xi'an in mainland China , and <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first primary school</COREF> was called *-2 *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the Zuo Xiu school</COREF> .
Because of the war , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> transferred out after only one year .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">The name of <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the school</COREF></COREF> actually was an abbreviation for a term meaning " *PRO* to educate and cultivate . "
But in <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">contemporary Taiwan</COREF> , coincidentally , the characters zuo xiu mean " *PRO* to put on a show " or " market yourself . "
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> often jests , " It *EXP*-1 's because <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> never graduated from <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">' Make a Show ' primary school</COREF> that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm in the spot 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm in *T*-2 today . "
<COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Political writer Hsia Chen</COREF> says that when <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> was foreign minister *T*-1 , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> laid the foundations of pragmatic diplomacy , and allowed Kuo Wan - jung to attend the Asian Development Bank annual conference in Beijing .
After <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Lee Teng - hui</COREF> came to power , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> went through a series of battles with successive premiers :
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> is the only one who *T*-1 has had a harmonious working relationship with <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> .
<COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Hsia</COREF> says that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Lien 's</COREF> political character tends *-1 to be easy - going and generous , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can comfortably delegate authority , and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is calm under pressure .

Compared to Lien Chan , who *T*-1 comes from a wealthy family , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian , who *T*-2 is an entirely self - made man</COREF> , makes a marked contrast .

For example , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> adopted a curfew for young people virtually unilaterally .
As <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> puts it : " Perhaps <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> would say that many problems in <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei</COREF> had reached a point calling for decisive action , but whether efficiency is more important than consultation is an eternally debatable question . "
A group of 33 education reform advocacy organizations rated <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the five candidates</COREF> on <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> views on education reform .
On the question , " Does the candidate have a grasp of the key problems in education reform in Taiwan ? "
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> and <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu Hsin - liang</COREF> were given *-1 top marks .
" <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> dares *PRO*-1 to talk about the cost of reform , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="117" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ting Chih - jen</COREF> , <COREF ID="117" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of one of these education reform groups</COREF></COREF> .
Everybody knows 0 the education system must be reformed *-1 , but reform costs money .
" <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> dares *PRO*-1 to talk about the problem of *PRO* paying the bill . "
However , though <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will ask the legislature *PRO*-1 to guarantee the necessary financing , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does not , as <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu Hsin - liang</COREF> does *?* , guarantee that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will spend 6 % of GDP on education .
" <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's not clear enough , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">Ting , who *T*-2 opines that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> thinks that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can wait until <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's elected *-3 before <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> decides how much money *PRO* to spend *T*-4</COREF> .
Overall , " <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> is good at *PRO* finding the weaknesses in others ' policies , but not as good at *PRO* facing up to questions when <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is in power *T*-1 .
It *EXP*-1 may be easy *PRO* to become the emperor , but *PRO* to win the people 's hearts requires concrete action . "

Pork barrel politics
As for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">James Soong</COREF> , " <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> policies are more for *PRO* helping the weak , and give more thought to the poor . "
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Soong</COREF> has taken into account the long - existing disparity between state - funded and private secondary schools in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">private schools</COREF> are much more expensive , though <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> merely provide the same education as the state schools -RRB- .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> platform includes subsidies 0 *T*-1 to assist the children of low - income families who *T*-2 attend private secondary schools .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Ting</COREF> admits that in *PRO* evaluating education platforms , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the incumbent</COREF> , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lien Chan</COREF></COREF> , is at a relative disadvantage , because the policies currently being implemented * are open to immediate scrutiny .
According to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Ting</COREF> , " <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chan</COREF> has been at odds with the education community for a long time . "
Reformers are most disappointed that the education budget has been seriously squeezed *-1 these past few years , *PRO*-1 falling by as much as NT$ 40 billion *U* in a single year .
" <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> is also the candidate who *T*-2 is most likely * to believe that <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">problems</COREF> can be solved *-3 by *PRO* throwing money at <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Ting</COREF> .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> has stated that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to extend compulsory education from 9 *RNR*-2 to 12 *RNR*-2 years , and to offer <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">vouchers for pre-school and private secondary education</COREF> .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> would all place tremendous strain on the already overstretched education budget .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">The government debt</COREF> is currently NT$ 2.6 trillion *U* , ten times higher than a decade ago ; if <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">these promised education " checks "</COREF> were actually cashed *-1 , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the debt</COREF> would pass NT$ 3 trillion *U* .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Ting</COREF> concludes : " <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has lost <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> direction in terms of education policy , and <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> underestimates the education community .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> thinks 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> just has to promise *PRO*-1 to throw money around and then <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll have people persuaded *-2 . "
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Educators</COREF> are not looking *PRO*-1 to be a burden on <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> ; all 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *T*-2 is that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> stop *-3 squeezing the existing budget smaller and smaller .
In fact , the " checks " 0 <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">candidates</COREF> write *T*-1 are closely connected to <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> assumptions about the roles 0 governments should play *T*-2 .
" Just as wool grows on a sheep , if <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the government role</COREF> expands , <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will require ever greater resources , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wu Hui - lin</COREF> , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a researcher at the Chung Hua Institution for Economic Research</COREF></COREF> .
As an economist , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> advocates the free market and thinks that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> effectiveness should not be overrated *-1 .
For example , large - scale government encouragement of high - tech industry has contributed to an imbalance in the industrial structure .
The stock market is an even more obvious example :
From the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Ministry of Finance to the proposed Stock Stabilization Fund , you can see <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> shadow everywhere .
" <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The government</COREF> should go back to *PRO* just <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">playing</COREF> a referee role , and do <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> well , " <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> avers *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> applies to economic relations with <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> as well , Because wherever there are controls *T*-1 there will be speculation
<COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> applies to economic relations with <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> as well .
Laws ca n't cover everything , and always leave gray areas , so that " influential persons are positioned *-1 to undertake quasi-legal activities with impunity .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The government</COREF> should not be creating special opportunities for the private profit of certain individuals . "
<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> believes 0 <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> should be left *-1 to <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> .

Improvement , not change
However , others have the opposite view .
Some believe that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> market is too affected *-1 by non-economic factors , so <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> must play a protective role .
There has long been debate in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> over the relative importance of the market and government intervention .
But it *EXP*-1 can not be overlooked *-2 that one major reason 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is now the world 's 12th largest trading nation *T*-3 is because government policy has fostered economic prosperity .

"
Democratic reform in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> in recent years has <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">come</COREF> about without the shedding of a single drop of blood ; <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is an amazing accomplishment .

Ten years ago , the total annual value of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> imports and exports was NT$ 50 billion *U* .
Today that figure is NT$ 200 billion *U* , a four-fold increase .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Day</COREF> asks : " If <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> were not a good business environment , why would <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">big corporations</COREF> bring <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> second generation back from abroad *PRO*-1 to take over *T*-2 ?
In this era of globalization , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could simply let <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children stay overseas ! "
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> argues that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> was the country least affected * by the Asian financial crisis because <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> handled the situation well .

*PRO* Governing is different
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Wang Chien - chuang</COREF> states : " <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">All candidates</COREF> have beautiful - sounding platforms , because <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a presidential election , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must have a blueprint for *PRO* governing <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> .
But *PRO* running for office and running <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> are two very different things . "
It *EXP*-1 has been said *-2 , " *PRO* campaigning is like poetry , *PRO* governing is like an essay . "
In *PRO* writing a poem , one can create a coherent and highly refined work .
But it is only actual governing that *T*-1 tests one 's true staying power .
Scholars have stated that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the 2000 election in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> has three special characteristics :
For one thing , this is the first time 0 the opposition has a very real possibility of *PRO* taking the reins of government *T*-1 .
Secondly , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the three leading candidates</COREF> are so close 0 it *EXP*-1 is impossible *PRO* to tell who *T*-2 will win .
And third , whatever the outcome *T*-1 , this is the beginning of <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> post-strongman era</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">this new era</COREF> , says *?* <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> , new standards for leadership are needed *-2 .
The national leader must be more than just a local politico writ * large .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Wang</COREF> gives <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> personal analysis of the pros and cons for <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the three candidates</COREF> :
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Shui - bian</COREF> is the person who *T*-1 brings the most hope and vitality , because <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> policies would be clearly different from those of <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> biggest problem is " instability " - not personal instability , but policy instability .
For example , sometimes <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> seems *-3 opposed to *PRO* allowing <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">PRC</COREF> firms to invest in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , sometimes in favor ; sometimes <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> seems *-4 against the opening of direct links with <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> , sometimes not .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">James Soong</COREF> is very capable , but <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> very success may be <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> weak point .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is often very proud of <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> because <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> provincial administration built a bridge or aqueduct *PRO*-1 to meet the needs of ordinary people .
But , ancient Chinese governing wisdom criticizes <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">those who " *T*-1 accomplish a small feat and think 0 <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can do anything , or discover a trivial idea and think 0 <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are brilliant</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chan</COREF> offers stability above all .
But <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> carries a heavy burden .
<COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Lien</COREF> must face up to the fact that <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> party</COREF> has been governing in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> for 50 years , and people want change .
Even if <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">wins</COREF> , <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> may mean only that the people of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> are willing *PRO* to give <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Lien Chan</COREF> a chance , and would not necessarily be an endorsement of <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the KMT <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> .

Peace as a weapon
What kinds of challenges face *T*-1 the next leader of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> ?
Public opinion surveys show that voters are most concerned about crime and the economy .
In a February survey conducted * by the United Daily News , the number of citizens very concerned about crime was 31 % , eleven percentage points higher than four years ago .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Roughly the same percentage</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were most concerned about problems of finance and the economy .
Early this year Commonwealth magazine asked <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">citizens</COREF> , " What do <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 *T*-1 is the first thing 0 the new president should do *T*-2 after *PRO* taking office ? "
The results show that the people of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> believe that the most urgent problems are crime , " <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">black gold politics</COREF> " -LRB- <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the confluence of organized crime , moneyed interests , and corrupt politicians</COREF> -RRB- , and *PRO* raising economic competitiveness .
Senior journalist Chu Sung - chiu says that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">all three major candidates</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are opposed to black gold politics .
But <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">citizens</COREF> want more than slogans , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want effective action .
Political scientist Alexander Lu says that the crux of the issue is resoluteness .
If the resolve was there , it *EXP*-1 would not be that difficult *PRO* to reduce crime and corruption .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Ting Chih - jen</COREF> says , " Crime is rising fastest among youth . "
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> argues that education is in fact the best crime - fighting policy :
" If students can enjoy a happy learning environment at school , then society will no longer be sitting on a powderkeg . "
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Ting</COREF> says that , although <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">education</COREF> is not a panacea , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is certainly not irrelevant .
Unfortunately , the effects of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">education policy</COREF> are visible only in the long term , and <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> therefore has a relatively weak position in politics and is often neglected *-1 because <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">policymakers</COREF> probably will not see the fruits of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> efforts in <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> terms of office .
But the main industries of the 21st century , such as the information and telecommunications industries , are knowledge - based .
If education is done *-1 well , the benefits will spread to many other areas .
The greatest variable for <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> society remains <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the other side of the Taiwan Strait</COREF> .
" In the past two years , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has been continually testing where <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> will draw the line in cross-strait relations *T*-1 , " says *T*-2 social critic Nan Fang Shuo .
But *PRO* playing word games over how *PRO* to define the relationship *T*-1 is simply a way of *PRO* hiding from the problem , ostrich - like , as the situation deteriorates .
Fortunately <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the three main candidates</COREF> have committed <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> to a moderate path .
Right now there 's a choice between peace and war in cross-strait relations .
The most important challenge for <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> now is *PRO* to transcend the old mentalities of cold war anti-communism and <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> independence , and to build a new logic of peace .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> future is now in the hands of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> voters .
