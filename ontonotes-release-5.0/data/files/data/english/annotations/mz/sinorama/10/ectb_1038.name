Internet Pioneer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heidi Hsueh</ENAMEX>
When the Internet started to take off in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inforian</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> Internet startups .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years since</ENAMEX> it has made quite a splash in the industry .
Back when the Internet in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> mainly meant college students posting on bulletin boards and fooling around with <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Mosaic</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">23 - year - old</ENAMEX> graduate student at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Chengchi University</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heidi Hsueh</ENAMEX> and a graduate student at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan University</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawrence Ho</ENAMEX> decided to form an Internet company together .
They started with just <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 500,000</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> , who speaks with all the self - confidence of a prophet , recalls that she could early on see the tremendous impact that the Internet was going to have on people s lives .
" We were riding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> wave , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> , who points out that deciding to strike at the right time is the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> step to success .
Starting with books
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early period</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inforian</ENAMEX> - or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">pAsia</ENAMEX> as it is known <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> - made money by publishing books and by localizing software for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> , the co-founder and executive vice president , ca n't count how many times she stayed up all night at the office in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">those early days</ENAMEX> .
Once , when their distributor for some reason refused to make payments , they had to endure <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two months</ENAMEX> without any incoming revenue .
" When you 're considering founding a company , " she says , issuing a warning to the many youths throwing themselves into Internet startups , " you 've really got to consider carefully the pressures you 're going to be under . "
The division of labor was clear from the start .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ho</ENAMEX> was responsible for product design , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> handled business development and marketing strategy .
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> , the company had its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> success : the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ97</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inforian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Quest</ENAMEX> -RRB- meta - search engine .
It hit a homerun for their Internet dreams .
Not long after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ho</ENAMEX> finished <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ97</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> sent it to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> website <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ZDNet</ENAMEX> , which awarded it <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> stars , its highest rating .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> then used the Internet to find distributors around the world .
Soon <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">IQ97</ENAMEX> had been translated into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> languages and plans were laid to step into the global market .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Within a year</ENAMEX> of the product 's release in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October of 1997</ENAMEX> , it had sold <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three million</ENAMEX> copies worldwide .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inforian</ENAMEX> followed by launching <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">CICQ</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> language instant messaging site that attracted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 million</ENAMEX> members from around the world .
Then in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> it focused on e-commerce , establishing the online auction site <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CoolBid</ENAMEX> , which has averaged quarterly sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 60 million</ENAMEX> and has as many as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100,000</ENAMEX> members .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> also made plans to forge alliances with world - famous companies .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> , after seeing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> 's strategic alliance plan , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel</ENAMEX> joined <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inforian</ENAMEX> as a strategic partner .
Later , it decided to take a stake in the company .
It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel</ENAMEX> had ever invested in an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> Internet company .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Inforian</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">pAsia</ENAMEX> as it is now known , has grown from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> employees to a staff of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">several hundred</ENAMEX> , and has become a multinational with offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and on the mainland , as well as in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
The Internet lifestyle
" At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">pAsia</ENAMEX> we emphasize that the Internet is a kind of technological art that allows people to improve their lifestyle , " <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> says .
" This is a work of art that requires creativity to be whole .
The Internet is part software , part media , part databank , and part communications device .
It 's the best possible space for making the most out of creativity .
" On the front door to the company 's office on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Hsinyi Road</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leonardo DaVinci</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Einstein</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">pAsia</ENAMEX> logo grace each other with their respective presences .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> notes that those <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> historical figures ' hard work and creativity changed the way people live .
This is also the spirit that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">pAsia</ENAMEX> wishes to project .
As far as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> is concerned , the Internet is both a tool and a communications platform .
Internet companies , she believes , should reflect that .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> such company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">pAsia</ENAMEX> must be flexible , efficient and practice what it preaches .
The intranet at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">pAsia</ENAMEX> , for instance , provides chatrooms , vacation request forms , work guidelines , business travel forms , and even a bulletin board for selling workers ' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - hand stuff .
The offices have neon decorations on the walls and a hallway that is no less stylish than a haute couture catwalk .
The whole office is infused with a modern and technological sensibility .
Of course , success is never guaranteed .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Tech</ENAMEX> stocks took a tumble in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">April of this year</ENAMEX> , and people began to talk about an Internet bubble .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">pAsia</ENAMEX> has had trouble obtaining new financing and has seen rapid turnover in its executive ranks , while rumors have circulated about its IPO application being rejected .
Nevertheless , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh</ENAMEX> holds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">pAsia</ENAMEX> has a clear niche and is very adaptable , so that it will be relatively unaffected by the economic downturn .
When you see <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heidi Hsueh 's</ENAMEX> fresh young face and her no - nonsense approach to doing business , you quickly understand how members of the young generation are realizing their revolutionary ideas about lifestyle and career through the Internet .
