It 's the " Knowledge - Based " Economy , Stupid !
-LRB- Laura Li / photos by Jimmy Lin / tr. * by Phil Newell -RRB-
A saying has it that " knowledge is power . "
But here at the turn of the century , people are discovering that <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">knowledge</COREF> is more than just power ; <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is also profit .
*-1 Responding to the new realities , the Executive Yuan has put forward <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">a plan * to develop <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> " knowledge - based economy " which *T*-2 aims *-2 to double per capita income within ten years</COREF> .
<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">This plan</COREF> embraces the long-term economic goals of the new administration .
But what *T*-1 is covered *-1 under the rubric of * developing the knowledge - based economy ?
What conditions *T*-1 are required *-1 * to be successful ?
Does <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> meet these criteria ?
Did you know that 90 % of the knowledge in <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> has been produced *-1 in the half century since the end of World War II ?
And in 20 years , what we know *T*-1 today will be only one percent of the total knowledge bank of our children !
" It *EXP*-1 is estimated *-2 that <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">the pool of human knowledge</COREF> doubled once every fifty years in the 19th century , and about once every ten years in <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the 20th century</COREF> .
Now <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> doubles once every three to five years , " notes *T*-1 <COREF ID="252" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wu Se-hwa</COREF> , <COREF ID="252" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">dean of the business school at National Chengchi University</COREF> .
The explosive growth of information is the most distinctive feature of <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the 20th century</COREF> , and has brought sweeping changes to <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the world 's</COREF> political , social , and economic structure .

Profit defines value
In 1992 , shortly after <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">US president Bill Clinton</COREF> took office , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> declared that emphasis should be placed *-1 on research and development and on * creating a " new economy . "
It turns out that these last eight years in the US have been a golden age of high economic growth , falling unemployment , and stable prices .
In 1996 , the OECD coined <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the term " knowledge - based economy</COREF> , " and many governments have jumped on the bandwagon since .
You can call <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> the " new economy " or the " knowledge - based economy " or whatever , but what is <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 really ?
How can such an economy be created *-1 *T*-2 ?
Because each country has different development needs , there are many different answers to these questions .
Wu Se-hwa points out that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the term " knowledge - based economy "</COREF> refers to any economic activity based * on the production or application of knowledge , in which " knowledge " includes all kinds of technology , patents , management know-how , and individual creations *T*-1 .
It *EXP*-2 is not important how profound or esoteric <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the knowledge</COREF> may be *T*-1 ; what *T*-3 matters most is * turning <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">that knowledge</COREF> into a product which *T*-4 can earn a profit .
* Looking back at the economic history of the West , in 16th century society , agricultural products were the key to wealth and power .
Whoever *T*-1 had the most , and most fertile , land was in a dominant position .
In the industrial age , capitalists who *T*-1 commanded the wealth 0 *T*-2 to buy machinery and hire workers , or who *T*-3 owned critical resources like coal and oil , replaced landowners as the dominant figures in the economy .
But today , whoever *T*-1 owns systematized knowledge will win out over his or her competitors .
When <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lester Thurow</COREF> , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the well - known economist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</COREF></COREF> , came to Taiwan *-1 to give a lecture a half year ago *T*-2 , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> pointed to <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Microsoft Corporation</COREF> as a prime example : <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Microsoft</COREF> owns no farmland , no oil fields , no expensive and sophisticated factories , and no shops of <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> product fits onto a tiny microchip .
Yet <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">this company</COREF> , relying only on the brainpower of several thousand engineers sitting in front of computers writing programs , has earned billions upon billions of dollars for owner Bill Gates .
It *EXP*-2 is estimated *-1 that 300 million persons use Microsoft Windows each day around the world , with annual revenues reaching US$ 25 billion *U* .

Knowledge petrie dish
In the past , Chinese people discovered much knowledge and invented much technology , but , *-1 influenced * by the Confucian belief that profit was not a worthy application of wisdom , never converted these into commercial products .
But in the face of today 's dramatic global economic transformation , there is no choice but * to try * to turn knowledge into profit .
And the thing that *T*-1 links knowledge with profit is <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-002-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">information technology</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-002-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">IT</COREF> -RRB- .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsu Wen-hsing</COREF> , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">founder of Smartek Engineering</COREF> , whose company *T*-1 has twice won national awards in Taiwan for its fingerprint verification device</COREF> , says that human history can be seen *-2 as the history of information .
When <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Marco Polo</COREF> visited the East in the 13th century *T*-1 , if <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had not left a written account of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> travels , it would have been a virtually wasted trip .
The recent enthusiasm for the Taipei exhibition of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">terracotta warriors from Xi'an</COREF> is due to the fact that <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">these long - buried figures</COREF> contain information about mysteries dating back 2000 years .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Hsu Wen-hsing</COREF> points out that in the past information was always tied *-1 to material objects , and remained in the hands of the few .
When <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the material objects</COREF> disappeared *T*-1 , so did *T*-2 the information 0 <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> contained *T*-3 .
But now , thanks to IT , for the first time in history information can be forever stored *-1 in huge volume , *-1 ready and waiting *-1 to be manipulated *-1 , exchanged *-1 , and even sent *-1 across great distances .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">IT</COREF> is like a petrie dish .
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Information cells</COREF> swim around in <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and can divide , recombine , reproduce , and copy <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> without limit , *-1 opening up entirely new possibilities for the accumulation and application of knowledge .
For example , computers are capable of * finding <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">numbers</COREF> hidden * under *RNR*-1 or scattered * throughout *RNR*-1 a huge pile of data which *T*-2 is impenetrable to the human brain , and can analyze and clarify <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">these numbers</COREF> into useful know-how .
" One order form is not information .
But , by * using a computer *-1 to save , connect , and search <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">individual order forms</COREF> , one can draw a thread through tens of thousands of <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , and discern <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> regularities and variations .
Now that 's knowledge , " declares *T*-1 <COREF ID="144" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Simon Chang</COREF> , <COREF ID="144" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president of Acer CyberCenter Services</COREF> .
At a glance you can find information such as regional and seasonal variations in sales , or market acceptance of a given product .

Everyone a multibillionaire !
In the information world , everyone is equal .
Though huge multinational corporations may have an edge in terms of information technology , since the rapid growth of <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> in the 1990s , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">' little guys ' whom no one has ever heard of *T*-1 before</COREF> - relying only on programming ability , creativity , and hard work - have had the space 0 * to bring <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> talents into play *T*-2 .
The best - known example is <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="29" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Yahoo</COREF> , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the world 's number one web portal</COREF></COREF> .
It all started with two Stanford PhD students looking for a way 0 * to categorize the websites online *T*-1 , who *T*-2 came up with <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">a great idea for a way 0 * to make * finding information easier for <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> users *T*-3</COREF> .
With <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">this idea</COREF> , after six years of hard work , today <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Yahoo</COREF> has a market value of US$ 50 billion *U* .
Over the past five years profits have grown at a rate of 9800 % , which *T*-1 has got *-1 to be some kind of record .
However , though <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">knowledge</COREF> may be profitable , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> value is subject to severe fluctuation .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">George Tsao</COREF> , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">assistant vice president of the Knowledge Management Center at Winbond Electronics Corporation</COREF> , notes that in the past you could determine the worth of <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-003-E2" TYPE="IDENT">a company</COREF> by * adding up <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-003-E2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> fixed assets -LRB- such as land and factories -RRB- and liquid assets -LRB- such as cash -RRB- , with each calculable down to the last penny .
But knowledge is intangible .
Two different software packages burned * onto identical chips can have grossly different values .
Sometimes it all depends on luck or fads .
The dramatic rise and fall of US software stocks this past year reflects the difficulty of * assessing the value of knowledge .
Wu Se-hwa points to <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Intel</COREF> as a prime example of how knowledge can " convert silicon to gold *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">A name - card sized CPU</COREF> is in fact just a chipboard with complicated circuitry , with a unit cost of less than US$ 35 *U* .
But because <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> includes unique information that *T*-1 makes the computer run , and carries the authority of " <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Intel</COREF> inside , " <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can fetch over US$ 1000 *U* *ICH*-2 in the marketplace , many times the cost of production .

What about <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> ?
Clearly there is already a global trend in which <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">an information economy</COREF> is taking shape *T*-1 .
What advantages does <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> have *T*-1 for * playing a larger role in this realm ?
Simon Chang , who *T*-1 left the job of director of planning at the National Science Council only six months ago *-1 to enter the private sector , points out that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the knowledge - based economy</COREF> basically deals in information technology , and the IT industry is the most profitable region in the emerging geography of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the knowledge - based economy</COREF> .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> currently ranks fourth in <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> in value of IT production , and , if you include the plants established * by <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> investors across <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the globe</COREF> , Taiwanese - controlled firms lead <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> in manufacturing of IT hardware .
In other words , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has a solid manufacturing base and a large pool of high quality human resources on which <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can rely *T*-1 * to develop <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the knowledge - based economy</COREF> .
Also , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has a strong education system .
The results of a recent international survey measuring the performance of junior high school students in <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">natural sciences</COREF> and <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">math</COREF> show that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> kids finished first in <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the former</COREF> and third -LRB- behind only Singapore and Korea -RRB- in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the latter</COREF> .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Alice Chang</COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">CEO of CyberLink Corporation</COREF> , whose firm *T*-1 has become a much - coveted new entry in the stock market and has drawn international attention with audio-visual software like Power DVD and Talking Show , says : " Talented people are at the root of knowledge . "
AV software is very difficult 0 * to produce *T*-1 , and staff must <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">have</COREF> a solid grounding in math .
<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is where <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is at an advantage *T*-1 .

<TEXT PARTNO="005">
However , though <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> strong points , there are also a number of problems and shortcomings .
" The first thing 0 * to consider *T*-3 , says *?* <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Se-hwa</COREF> , " is this :
What kind of knowledge - based economy is <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> most suited *-1 to *T*-2 ? "
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> says that right now what the government is focusing on *T*-1 and what stock market players most hope for *T*-2 is a US - style " new economy . "
The focus is on new industries , such as software and the Internet , or communications technology , fiber - optics , biotechnology , and the like .
But can <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the American model</COREF> be reproduced *-1 in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> ?
There is little reason 0 * to be optimistic *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">The new economy in <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF></COREF> depends heavily , for one thing , on a deep foundation of basic scientific research , which *T*-1 comes up with revolutionary products like genetically modified foods .
Another key factor is that <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> has a mechanism for innovation and entrepreneurship , so that new ideas have a chance * to be brought * into play .
The rapid growth in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the new economy</COREF> has driven a decade - long economic boom in <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the States</COREF> .
The old manufacturing economy has naturally been trimmed *-1 back , with factories relocating overseas , but American firms can depend on the rights to technology *-2 to earn a profit .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Pearl Tan</COREF> , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">public relations manager at <COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Applied Materials Taiwan</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a subsidiary of the giant US semiconductor equipment manufacturer of the same name</COREF></COREF> , points to <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-005-E7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a prime example</COREF> : <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-005-E7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-005-E6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">DRAM</COREF> , <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-005-E6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the hottest industry in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF></COREF> , which *T*-1 was a monopoly of <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the US firm Texas Instruments</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Tan</COREF> notes that although DRAM factories are closing one after another in <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> , patent royalties must still be paid *-1 to <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Texas Instruments</COREF> for each and every one of the more than 100 million DRAMs produced * around the world annually .
This is a classic " knowledge goose that *T*-1 lays golden eggs . "
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">The new economy</COREF> is a weapon by which <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> dominates <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> , with " the export of knowledge " replacing the export of goods *T*-1 .
Yet , in <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the entire world</COREF> , <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">only <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> , Japan , and the UK</COREF> export more technology than <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> import *?* .
In other words , only <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">these three countries</COREF> have a surplus in " knowledge trade , " and can make money by * selling knowledge .
Of <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">these three</COREF> , US income from * selling technology is four times the amount 0 <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> spends *T*-1 * buying technology elsewhere , and <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> earns enough *ICH*-2 *ICH*-3 each year in patent royalties * to balance <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> enormous deficit in manufactured goods .
In contrast , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> is still showing a nasty deficit in knowledge trade , with <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">money</COREF> going out twice as fast as <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is coming in *?* .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">The impressive American model</COREF> would certainly be difficult 0 * to apply *T*-1 to the small " shallow " economy in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ko Chen-en</COREF> , <COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">dean of the College of Management at National Taiwan University</COREF></COREF> , puts it : " You merely have *-1 to ask how many Nobel Prize winners <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> has *T*-2 - not many - and you know <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> real ability * to follow <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the US economic model</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">Ko</COREF> relates that " high-risk and high-profit " revolutionary new technologies can normally only be created *-1 with enormous financial backing .
In 1999 , total expenditures on R-AMP-D in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> by both the government and private sector were a mere NT$ 200 billion *U* -LRB- about US $ 6 billion *U* -RRB- , less than * was spent * by IBM alone .

Slow improvement
In contrast to the " picking stars from the sky " US model , says *?* <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Se-hwa</COREF> , " the European knowledge - based economy concept is closer to what <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> needs *T*-1 . "
As <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> explains *?* , the OECD definition of the knowledge - based economy embraces all kinds of industries , from Italian shoes to Dutch flowers .
Any industry that *T*-1 increases its knowledge component , *-1 using knowledge *-2 to improve management , innovate , or improve quality , can be considered *-3 a knowledge industry .
This is a much more practical ambition for <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , which *T*-1 has a high proportion of traditional industry and is extremely dependent on OEM manufacturing *-1 to make money .
In 1998 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> had <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">more than 4500 patents approved * in <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF></COREF> , *-1 ranking fourth .
But not many of <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> were for original discoveries ; most were in the category of improvements of old ideas , mainly ways 0 * to increase efficiency in the manufacturing process *T*-1 .
Innovations that *T*-1 are improvements require less money for R-AMP-D , and do not require genius-like creativity , but can be made *-2 primarily by * devoting more attention to a specific problem .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">S.T. Day</COREF> , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chairman of the National Association of Small and Medium Enterprises of the ROC , and chairman of <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the San Sun Hat and Cap Company</COREF></COREF></COREF> , takes the following case in point : On most caps there is <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">an " eyelet "</COREF> in the stitching .
But , because of different machine designs , <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the gap</COREF> can be 80 , 90 , or 100 stitches , * creating problems for quality control .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">San Sun</COREF> created a computer program that *T*-1 ensures that <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">machines</COREF> leave a uniform gap of 95 stitches , and even gets <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the machines</COREF> to tie a lovely knot when the sticthcing is completed *-2 *T*-3 .
This seemingly small improvement actually allows <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the firm</COREF> to charge double the unit price per hat .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Day</COREF> has factories in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> , <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> , and Dominica .
Wages in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> are 15 times greater than in <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> , and 100 times greater than in Burma .
" If <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-006-E3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> workers</COREF> just make hats and do nothing else , then it does n't pay .
But if , because of <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-006-E3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> higher quality , <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-006-E3" TYPE="IDENT">these workers</COREF> come up with <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-006-E3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own ideas for * improving the production process , then <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-006-E3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are worth it , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Day</COREF> with the voice of experience .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says that in * assessing the value of <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">employees</COREF> , you have *-1 to look at more than just the value of the product ; you have *-2 to also take into account <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> " intelligence " value .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">San Sun</COREF> insists 0 <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will not lay off any <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> workers , nor will <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> hire foreign laborers in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , and <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sales have not suffered as a result .
Indeed , orders through October of 2000 showed an increase of 60 % over the previous year .

In 1998 , when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Intel</COREF> insisted on * sticking with expensive Rambus memory chips despite a poor market response *T*-2 , <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">VIA</COREF> saw <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> opportunity :
<COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> began *-3 promoting use of the P133 memory chip , which *T*-4 had been created *-4 by an international consortium and was provided *-4 to factories *-4 free of charge .
For the first time , <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">VIA</COREF> had challenged <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the " big boss</COREF> , " <COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Intel</COREF></COREF> .
In the latter half of 1999 , <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">VIA</COREF> acquired two CPU companies in the States , * giving <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> an independent ability * to develop CPUs .
In addition , half a year ago <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> entered into cooperation with <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-007-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the US graphics powerhouse</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-007-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">S3</COREF> * to make graphics chips .
In these ways , <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">VIA</COREF> is moving step by step *-1 to enlarge <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> intellectual holdings .
" You have *-1 to have a lot of technology already on hand before you can start *-2 talking about systematic integration and trying out major innovations , " says *T*-3 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> .
It is only now that <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">VIA</COREF> can escape from the specifications dictated * by large multinational firms , and create innovative products of <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own .
* To meet future market demand for home appliances that *T*-1 are inexpensive , multi-functional , and portable , the main direction will be * to get all the functions on to a single chip .
<COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">VIA</COREF> has designed a new 3 - in - 1 chipset which *T*-1 includes CPU , memory , and graphics , which *T*-2 are expected *-2 to formally hit the market in the first half of 2001 .
As <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Lee</COREF> reveals *?* : " No one has ever done this before .
<COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-007-E4" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are trying something new . "

* Save the idiots !
Nonetheless , knowledge and creativity are intangible , and it *EXP*-1 is not always easy * to determine ownership .
This is especially problematic in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , where some people still do n't have a very clear idea about intellectual property rights *T*-1 , and legal protections are less than comprehensive *T*-1 .
This is a potential problem for the development of the knowledge - based economy in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
" Many innovations just represent * going a little bit further *ICH*-1 in * thinking about a problem than <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the other guys</COREF> , and once the secret is uncovered *-2 , it *EXP*-3 is easy for <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to copy the idea , " says *T*-4 <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Simon Chang</COREF> .
The most famous example in the industry involves <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">a certain company that *T*-1 wanted *-1 to create information systems like storage and document handling</COREF> .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> invited <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-008-E1" TYPE="IDENT">a number of information industry firms</COREF> *-1 to give briefings on <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-008-E1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> products .
After a while , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">this former " outsider "</COREF> became an insider , and created <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own product , * congratulating <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> on * saving so much money in the process .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Simon Chang</COREF> notes that a major innovation usually is nested *-1 in a lot of small innovations .
If small innovations are not recognized *-1 , or do not get appropriate market rewards , this will destroy the motivation * to innovate at all .
This is precisely the problem now being faced * by <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="82" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Comdek</COREF> , <COREF ID="82" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the first company in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> 0 *T*-1 to produce medical instruments such as blood - oxygen monitors and ear thermometers</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="94" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Michael Y.S. Kuo</COREF> , <COREF ID="94" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">general manager at <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Comdek</COREF></COREF></COREF> , points out that the quick and easy process of * taking body temperature through the ear was developed *-1 by an American company , and <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the German giant Boehringer-Ingelheim</COREF> paid a huge amount of money for the patent so <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could begin production .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Comdek</COREF> took <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the basic principle</COREF> , and went to work on <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , *-1 eventually coming up with <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own version , for which <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have been awarded *-3 a patent *T*-2 .
But when <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Comdek 's</COREF> product came out *T*-1 , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Michael Kuo</COREF> still found <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> in a vicious struggle with <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> pirate firms : " It 's equivalent to * making fools out of those of us who *T*-2 invest the money 0 *T*-4 to do research and development ! "
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Kuo</COREF> says that while there has been some improvement in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> with regard to protection of intellectual property rights , there is still not enough for those who *T*-1 invest in development and innovation .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Comdek</COREF> has closed <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> laboratory and production line to any outside visits , and has not ruled out the possibility of * moving <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> lab overseas * to get away from industrial espionage in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .

Espionage reflects a lack of respect for knowledge .
But there is also the problem of insufficient awareness of the potential value of knowledge , so that , as <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Wu Se-hwa</COREF> says *?* , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms</COREF> " are sitting on a mountain of gold , but do n't know that <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can sell what <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know *T*-1 for hard cash . "
" The most ' classic ' form of knowledge product is one in which the intangible value of the knowledge transcends the tangible value of the product *T*-1 , and 0 *T*-2 can be reproduced *-2 in large volume at low cost , *-2 thus earning huge profits . "
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> points to <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the US coffee shop chain Starbucks</COREF> .
Can <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> really make huge profits just by * selling cups of coffee for a couple of bucks ?
Of course not .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">The headquarters company</COREF> in fact spends most of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> time *-1 handling the sale of franchise rights worldwide .
What <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Starbucks</COREF> sells *T*-1 is not coffee , but " *NOT* the knowledge of how * to run a coffee shop *T*-2 . "
The same logic applies to <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">McDonalds</COREF> :
Who *T*-1 does n't know how * to draw <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> " golden arches " trademark *T*-2 ?
It *EXP*-2 does n't seem *-1 to require any great wisdom * to have <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">a bright and clean store with fast - food service</COREF> , but when you link <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">this simple product</COREF> together with a trademark , powerful name recognition , and high quality control *T*-3 , the result has swept the globe .
Now over 20,000 franchises worldwide work * to expand <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> territory while <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the headquarters</COREF> takes 0.5 % of operating revenues as <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> share for as long as the franchise lasts *?* .
In recent years , as <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> firms have increasingly invested abroad , the " <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> experience " has penetrated deeply into Southeast Asia and <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-009-E3" TYPE="IDENT">mainland China</COREF> .
In both the manufacturing and service sectors , <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> businessmen have proven adept at * flexibly adapting to local society .
But now that <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> methods are well understood and widely copied , <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> investors</COREF> are being dropped *-1 by <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> local partners .
" <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> companies</COREF> do n't understand how * to ensure <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> earnings from management knowledge and company name recognition *T*-1 , and are not in the habit of * selling rights or earning royalties , " says *T*-2 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> with regret , as <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> offers the following examples : <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> department stores are a cut above <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-009-E3" TYPE="IDENT">PRC</COREF> state - run stores , <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> construction industry has the knack for systematic management , and <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">even industries like eel - raising</COREF> have <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own technologies and operating methods , but <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> only think about * keeping these secrets to <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> and making money by * working on <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own .
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do n't know how * to spread <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">knowledge</COREF> so that others will make money for <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-1 !
Of course , * to sell operational know-how , <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">this knowledge</COREF> must be converted *-1 into steps , systems , and standards , and must be well - packaged .
And trademarks and patents must be employed *-1 * to deter potential pirates .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> suggests that organizations in <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> which *T*-1 are dedicated *-1 to * teaching management methods , such as the China Productivity Center , should assist <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-009-E4" TYPE="IDENT">companies</COREF> in * systematizing and selling the rights to <COREF ID="ectb_1042.part-009-E4" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mangement and operating philosophies , so that the uniquely flexible <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> approach to business can be reproduced and marketed *-2 worldwide .
" If only <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> would change <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> attitudes , the knowledge - based economy could have many new components , and every industry , firm , or individual could find an opportunity * to make money on this new frontier , "
concludes <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Wu</COREF> .
* Looking to the future , the road to <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">a knowledge - based economy</COREF> is long , but <COREF ID="202" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is the only choice for <COREF ID="ectb_1042-part-009-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
