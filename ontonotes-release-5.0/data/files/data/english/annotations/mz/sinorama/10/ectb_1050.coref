<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> : Storied Past , Uncertain Future
-LRB- Lin I - hsien / photos by Diago Chiu / tr. * by <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Phil Newell</COREF> -RRB-
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wonder if <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> is jealous of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ask because fate has treated these two towns , separated * only by the mouth of the Tanshui River , very differently .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> is celebrated *-1 in poems , songs , paintings , and lovers ' memories of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> scenic views .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> has donuts , mussels , a garbage landfill , and troubles which *T*-1 have yet *-1 to be revealed *-1 to the outside world .
Have you heard this legend ?
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Liao Tianding</COREF> , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Taiwan 's Robin Hood</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-1 fleeing from imperial soldiers , took refuge in <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> , where <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> fell in love with a local woman , and , later , at age 27 , was murdered *-2 in the Monkey Cave at Laochienkeng -LRB- in <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Pali Rural Township</COREF> -RRB- by one of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> best friends *T*-3 .
Countless legends grew up around <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Liao</COREF> after <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> death , and the people of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> began *-1 to worship <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> spirit .
In 1958 , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> small burial plot was converted *-1 into <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">a huge temple</COREF> .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has followers scattered * far and wide , and every year on <COREF ID="ectb_1050.part-000-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the special day appointed * for *PRO* making offerings at <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> temple</COREF></COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1050.part-000-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the 26th day of the 10th month of the lunar calendar</COREF> -RRB- , the grounds are packed *-1 with cars and visitors .
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">The Ko brothers , now in <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> 60s</COREF> , recall <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> impressions of a visit to the <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Liao Tianding</COREF> gravesite : " It must have been 30 years ago , <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> used *-1 to go there just for the fun of it .
The road in front of <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the temple</COREF> was n't so wide then , and what a crowd !
People were so jammed *-1 in 0 you could n't move . "
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also recall that <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the Pali of those days</COREF> was a place in which most people lived by fishing , farming , or petty trading *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">The elder Ko</COREF> gives a thumbs - up and declares : " That 's why <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> always say that a can - do guy like <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Liao Tianding</COREF> must be looking after <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> , so that <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have developed and can even earn money from the tourists *T*-1 . "
Yet , <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may not know about <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Pali 's</COREF> real heyday , long in the past .

<TEXT PARTNO="001">
The days of the sailing ships
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> was originally called *-1 *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Palifen</COREF> , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a transliteration of the place name used * by the Ketagalan indigenous people</COREF> .
Located * on the northwest corner of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> *T*-2 faces the Taiwan Strait to the northwest , rests against Mt. Kuanyin to the southeast , and looks across <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the river</COREF> toward <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui</COREF> to the northeast .
Though <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't have much of a hinterland , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> geographic location has proved *-1 historically important , as one can see from the prehistoric cultures unearthed * at the Ta - pen - keng and Shih - san - hang archeological sites .
Later , when <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Han Chinese</COREF> began *-2 trickling across to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> mainly settled along rivers .
Because <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> is relatively close to <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> and sits at the mouth of a river , despite the fact that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does not have a natural harbor , in 1757 the Qing court designated <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 to be one of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> small number of official ports for maritime transport with <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> .
Thus began an era in which great ships sailed in *RNR*-2 and out of *RNR*-2 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> *T*-1 .
However , as a result of silting and a destructive typhoon that *T*-1 struck in 1796 , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> began *-2 to give way in importance to <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Tanshui , located * just across <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the river</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Once mainly dependent on fishing , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> increasingly came *PRO*-1 to rely on farming .
But the hilly terrain and strong winds meant that there was little good land .
While <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the hardy people of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF></COREF> barely kept <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> stomachs *PRO*-1 filled , <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children and grandchildren left in search of a better life .
Neither the Japanese occupation -LRB- which *T*-1 began in 1895 -RRB- nor the return to Chinese rule -LRB- in 1945 -RRB- brought much joy or change to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">this rural area</COREF> .
But in the 1970s , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">urban planning</COREF> came to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> proved *-1 to be the prelude to a symphony -LRB- or perhaps cacophony -RRB- of transformation .

*PRO* Changing the rhythm of <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> life
During the height of real estate speculation and soaring land prices in <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei</COREF> , builders put up self - described " villas " and " mansions " -LRB- apartment blocks , in fact -RRB- one after another in <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> .
Also , *PRO* to try *PRO* to reduce the outflow of population from <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> and to get the stagnant local economy moving , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> decided *PRO*-1 to link <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this formerly isolated village</COREF> to the outside world .
What *T*-1 had been Chungshan Road was turned *-2 into Provincial Highway #15 , and the opening of the Kuantu Bridge to traffic linked <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> directly to the busy <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei</COREF> districts of Shilin and Peitou .
*PRO*-1 Gifted *-1 with a lovely setting between the mountains and the sea , <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> began *-1 to dream of a tourism boom .
But fortune had other things in store .
In order *PRO* to pave the way for the construction of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">a water treatment facility</COREF> on <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the northeast edge of <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF></COREF> , the plan *PRO* to develop tourism in <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> was scrapped *-1 overnight .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">The government</COREF> , applying urban planning principles , zoned <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the area</COREF> for residential and industrial use , in order *PRO* to create a construction site for <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the facility</COREF> .
Then in 1987 came the program to bring gravel from eastern to western Taiwan for construction purposes , and a harbor was built *-1 on the <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> coast for the convenience of gravel transporters .
In accordance with the urban plan , <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">new streets</COREF> were cut *-1 this way and that through <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali 's</COREF> land , and high - rise buildings sprang up along the sides of <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">these roadways</COREF> .
The sounds of backhoes at work resounded even from the black sand beaches .
In 1997 , the <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E4" TYPE="IDENT">Hsiachuotzu</COREF> garbage landfill formally opened , and it became common *PRO* to see fleets of garbage trucks winding through the streets of <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> .
<COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E4" TYPE="IDENT">This rural township , which *T*-1 was made *-1 responsible for *PRO* storing the garbage from several communities in <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Taipei County</COREF></COREF> , seemed *-2 resigned to the fate -LRB- suffered * by many outlying areas -RRB- of *PRO* having * to choke on the garbage spit * up by others .
It is only recently that the residents of <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E4" TYPE="IDENT">Hsiachuotsu</COREF> , unable *PRO* to stand the smell , have begun *-1 to protest *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Lin Yi - hung , born and raised * in <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF></COREF> , stands on the roof of <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> house and looks across to the beach where <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> used *-1 to run and play *T*-2 as a child .
<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> can not help but sigh , as <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> looks at the ranks of new buildings and thinks of the dramatic changes that *T*-1 have come to <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this area</COREF> : " These construction projects have destroyed the relationship 0 <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">we people of <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF></COREF> used *-2 to have *T*-3 with the sea . "
It *EXP*-1 's certainly true that <COREF ID="ectb_1050.part-002-E6" TYPE="IDENT">a lot of people here</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="ectb_1050.part-002-E6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would get rich from the rezoning .
But just because <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">land</COREF> increases in value does n't mean 0 someone will buy <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and just because apartment complexes are built *-1 does n't mean there are people who *T*-2 want *PRO*-2 to live there .
Worst of all , interpersonal relationships have been poisoned *-1 in the struggle over *PRO* divvying up the profits , because no one really knows how much money *T*-2 is involved *-2 .
<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Lin</COREF> concludes : " <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am not by any means opposed *-1 to development .
But development is not necessarily the same as progress .
Can <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF></COREF> really survive change of this magnitude ? "

All part of the plan ?
One after another , government development plans have raised the expectations of <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> residents .
But so far the only things 0 <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> folk have been able *PRO*-1 to enjoy *T*-2 have been flying dust from construction sites , roads filled * with giant trucks , and new neighbors of an " otherworldly " kind .
The new roads have certainly brought in a group of immigrants anxious *PRO* to escape from Taipei City and return to nature .
But at the same time , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">verdant Mt. Kuanyin - named * for its uncanny resemblance to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the deity Kuanyin</COREF></COREF> - is covered *-1 with columbariums and cemeteries .
Even <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Kuanyin , worshipped * for <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> limitless compassion and mercy</COREF> , must be creasing <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> brow at this rampant overuse of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the mountain</COREF> .
<COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-003-E3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen Chien - kuo</COREF> , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a secretary in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the Pali Rural Township government</COREF></COREF></COREF> , says facetiously : " What can <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do *T*-1 ? <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have the mountains behind <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> and the sea in front .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> say 0 the fengshui is good here , so <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> come . "
<COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-003-E3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> adds , in a far less amused tone , that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> has been talking about *PRO* making <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Mt.

But after 30 years , the park plan is still a non-starter , and meanwhile many cemeteries and colum - bariums have " snuck in . "
" Nobody seems *-1 to care about <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> Pali</COREF> , and <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are very remote , so <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> just dump what <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't want *T*-2 out here .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> say that this is why <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> not only have *ICH*-2 a water pollution treatment plant and a garbage landfill , but also five nursing homes and hospices for the terminally ill *T*-1 . "
*PRO* Take <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the Taipei Happy Mountain Colony</COREF> for example .
<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">This venerable institution</COREF> was first used *-1 *PRO*-1 to house leprosy victims , who *T*-2 met only fear and loathing elsewhere .
In 1932 , a British missionary founded <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">this home</COREF> - over the strong opposition of the local gentry - *PRO* to offer leprosy victims a place 0 *PRO* to live in dignity and find warmth away from the cold outside world *T*-1 .
Today , <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Happy Mountain</COREF> is a home for physically and mentally challenged young people , and the simple old structure , surrounded * by greenery , rings with the laughter of children .
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Li Li - chuan , who *T*-1 works at <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Happy Mountain</COREF></COREF> , was born and raised *-2 right here in <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> .
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> family home is not far from <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the chil - dren 's home</COREF> .
" When <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was small *T*-1 <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> used *-2 to come here *PRO*-2 to play .
All the adults called <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the kids</COREF> *PRO*-1 ' empty - headed . '
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was small , and did n't know any better , so <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> just called <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-2 that too . "
*PRO*-1 Stroking the head of <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">a sleeping child with hydrocephalus</COREF> , <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says : " <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is so cute when <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> smiles *T*-2 ! "
*PRO*-1 Located * on the margins of the island of Taiwan , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF></COREF> take it in stride that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must live alongside the marginal people and objects cast * off by society - waste water , trash , the deceased , and victims of diseases that society would prefer *PRO*-3 not to see *T*-2 at all .
And there is no sign 0 this situation will end : Reports now say that all the waste and earth being moved * to Linkou for a land reclamation project there will be trucked *-1 along Provincial Highway #15 - right through the heart of <COREF ID="ectb_1050-part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Pali</COREF> .
