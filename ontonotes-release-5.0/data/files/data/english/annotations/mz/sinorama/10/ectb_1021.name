Everyday People and A Story of True Grit --
The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> Family of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taihsi</ENAMEX>
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Li</ENAMEX> / photos by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hsueh Chi - kuang</ENAMEX> / tr. by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Mayer</ENAMEX> -RRB-
They say a rising tide lifts all boats .
No one would know more about that than the older generation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> .
The changes of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five decades</ENAMEX> have had a deep impact , for example , on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> family of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunlin County</ENAMEX> .
Their main claim to fame is ... nothing , actually , and that is precisely why their story typifies the experiences of so many .
So lend your attention , dear reader , as we recount the ups and downs of an average family from a quiet little backwater called <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taihsi Township</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> and his older sister have come to meet me at the train station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Touliu</ENAMEX> , administrative seat of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunlin County</ENAMEX> .
We pile into a car and head toward their parents ' home .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> fills me in on his hometown .
" <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taihsi</ENAMEX> is a rather unusual place , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> , the family 's oldest grandson and a doctoral candidate in sociology at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tunghai University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taichung</ENAMEX> .
" When I read the studies that describe <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> as being so prosperous , I have to wonder how their descriptions could be so totally different from what our lives have been .
They might as well be talking about a different planet . "
Probably most people do n't realize , adds <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> , that there are still places in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> as backward as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taihsi</ENAMEX> .
To the outsider , however , the place does n't look backward at all .
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> drives west in a very nice <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Toyota</ENAMEX> at a comfortable speed down a broad county highway , his older sister sits in the front passenger seat with cell phone in hand discussing the traffic situation with someone at home .
In the meantime , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsung - sheng 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five - year</ENAMEX> - old nephew clamors from the back seat for his mother to buy him a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pokemon</ENAMEX> plaything , just like kids the world over are doing these days .
When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's stores in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> were swamped <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> during a giveaway of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hello Kitty</ENAMEX> dolls , lots of people thought they might be able to beat the crowds by hitting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">McDonald</ENAMEX> 's in supposedly untrendy <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taihsi</ENAMEX> , but they found the lines there every bit as long as in more urban locations .
The emperor is far away
The scenery grows increasingly rural as we move west through the townships of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Huwei</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tuku</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paochung</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tungshih</ENAMEX> .
Temples tower over green rice fields .
<ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">Less than half an hour</ENAMEX> after leaving the train station we get off the county highway and onto narrow <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Tungshih East Road</ENAMEX> .
When we reach our destination in rural <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taihsi Township</ENAMEX> , a few dozen buildings of modern ferroconcrete construction line the road , and shops of every description occupy the ground floor of each one .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Tsung - sheng 's</ENAMEX> parents , who are pushing <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">60 years old</ENAMEX> , run a local bakery , and they greet us with the wide smiles and warm hospitality so typical of haikou -LRB- as the locals are accustomed to calling <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taihsi</ENAMEX> and the surrounding townships near the coast in western <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunlin County</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
They also speak <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> with an unmistakable haikou accent .
To welcome their guest they have ordered a big seafood meal in advance .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsung - sheng 's</ENAMEX> grandmother , parents , uncles , aunts , cousins , nephews , and nieces have all come in from around haikou for the gathering .
The strength of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> clan 's family ties is plainly evident .
These people go back for generations here .
From the destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> to the mixed joy and grief of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early post-war years</ENAMEX> , from the barest of rural hamlets to a prosperous little town , this family has seen it all .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">84 - year</ENAMEX> - old grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> is not as sharp as she used to be , but she can still rattle off a tale or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Two</ENAMEX> indignities suffered back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</ENAMEX> , in particular , remain indelibly etched in her memory .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> occurred in the latter part of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> tied her hands behind her back and marched her off to do forced labor for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">over a year</ENAMEX> , building roads , digging ditches , and carrying a shoulder pole .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> indignity was the onerous taxes that were levied in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early years</ENAMEX> after <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> rule .
" We had to pay taxes twice a year , " says grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> , flashing a mouthful of dental work .
" The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time was for water , and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> was for land .
It did n't matter whether you even had a crop to harvest or not - you had to pay , or they 'd throw you in jail . "
She explains that <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one dou</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 liters</ENAMEX> -RRB- of rice back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1940s</ENAMEX> was worth <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">five or six yuan</ENAMEX> , or about <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</ENAMEX> ' pay for a manual laborer , but the tax on <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one jia</ENAMEX> of land -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">0.97 hectares</ENAMEX> -RRB- was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">150 yuan</ENAMEX> .
A lot of people had to borrow money just to pay their taxes .
" It took <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</ENAMEX> to earn <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one dou</ENAMEX> of rice , " says grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> .
" We could n't afford to eat it , because we needed it to pay our taxes . "
Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> government eventually carried out land reform to provide relief for poor farmers , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> family never shared in the benefits .
They were as poor as their neighbors , to be sure , but they owned land and were thus classified as small landowners , which by definition meant that they neither had any extra land to rent out nor did they rent from others .
While many of their neighbors received land as a result of the reforms , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> family got nothing .
Grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> was close to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years</ENAMEX> old when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> recovered <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , but the event meant little to her , for she had never received any schooling .
All she remembers is that when the war ended , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> was turned over to " them . "
With a grin , grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> throws up her hands in a gesture of helplessness and quips , " When the colonial government spoke , I did n't understand their <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> .
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> speaks , I do n't understand their <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin</ENAMEX> either . "
" There 's no difference between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kuomintang</ENAMEX> , " says Grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> .
" If something important comes up , they send a local official out to make an announcement and explain what it 's all about . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> adds , " They 're totally outside the loop here .
You of course know the phrase , ' Heaven is high and the emperor is far away . '
Well , it was people like my grandmother who coined it . "
Grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> was adopted into the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> family at age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">ten</ENAMEX> .
Within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">half a year</ENAMEX> both of her adoptive parents died , and at age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">11</ENAMEX> she slipped and fell in the sugar cane fields , poking her left eye out .
Orphaned and blind in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> eye , a hard life lay in store for her , but she made the best of a bad situation .
With no male siblings to carry on the family line , at age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">25</ENAMEX> she managed to find a husband who was willing to let his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> male child take the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> surname .
The children came rapidly , and there was never any money to spare .
But it is clear that she does live reasonably well now .
When did survival cease to be such a struggle ?
Grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> remembers quite clearly when the turning point came .
It was in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> , when her oldest grandchild was already a teenager , that business gradually started going better for her <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> sons .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> brothers got together and decided that they should each give her <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 2,000</ENAMEX> every month .
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in her life , she was able to relax a bit , then <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</ENAMEX> the government started providing a monthly pension of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 3,000</ENAMEX> .
This was enough to cover meals , and her life improved even more .
Grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> now lives together with several other old folks very near the coast in the old traditional farmhouse where she grew up .
Her main worry these days is her granddaughter in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> , who is in her <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30s</ENAMEX> and still unmarried .
" Her father got married when he was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">22</ENAMEX> .
How can a girl be putting things off ? "
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">13 - year</ENAMEX> - old construction worker
A lot of hard work has gone into the comfortable life Grandma <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> enjoys <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
Her eldest son <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> recounts that after he graduated from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> grade in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1954</ENAMEX> his family was too poor to let him go any further in school , so at age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">13</ENAMEX> he took off with an older boy on the slow train for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> .
Without pausing to take in the sights of the big city , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - lo</ENAMEX> went straight to work at a construction site , where he carried a shoulder pole and mixed cement .
Buildings were going up everywhere in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1950s</ENAMEX> , and the city was bursting with opportunities .
But , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - lo</ENAMEX> , " I only had a grade - school education .
I did n't have what it took to think about a career in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> .
I just wanted to go back and help my family work the fields . "
After <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> he went back home just as the area was getting electric power for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time .
The bright lights at night got some people so excited at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> that they could n't get to sleep .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> back then was <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the world s biggest producers of sugar cane , but the harvest was extremely difficult work , as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - lo</ENAMEX> is painfully aware .
Once he came very close to cutting a finger clean off with a sickle , but he just slapped some cement mix -LRB- commonly regarded as a good disinfectant -RRB- on the wound and worked on through the pain .
United we stand
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> joined the army at age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20</ENAMEX> , and during his stint he made friends with someone who had been making a living as a baker .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - lo</ENAMEX> began to realize that selling his manual labor was not a viable long - term option .
He decided to open a bakery .
After receiving his discharge he borrowed <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 12,000</ENAMEX> from his father , hired a baker , and opened up a store .
He himself rode around on a motorcycle all day selling beverages and baked goods .
His capital ran out before he expected , and he had to ask for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> loan from his father - in - law to get his business off the ground .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">A few years later</ENAMEX> his younger brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Jui - ting</ENAMEX> -LRB- as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> son , he was given his father 's surname -RRB- got married and followed in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo 's</ENAMEX> footsteps by selling baked goods and beverages .
To avoid competing with his brother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jui - ting</ENAMEX> opened up his store over <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten kilometers</ENAMEX> north in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mailiao Township</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jui - ting</ENAMEX> , who in his youth always wore hand - me - downs and crude garments fashioned from throwaway rice sacks and the like , never put on his own set of store - bought clothes until just prior to joining the army .
Who would have guessed he would <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one</ENAMEX> day become the biggest beverage wholesaler in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mailiao</ENAMEX> area ?
Having watched his older brothers succeed with their bakery businesses , the youngest brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Kuo - lung</ENAMEX> took up the same business in the neighboring township of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Szuhu</ENAMEX> after finishing his military service .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> brothers have worked together over the years to build up their businesses , and an efficient division of labor has evolved among them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kuo - lung</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> is in charge of doing all the baking , and he acts as supplier for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Jui - ting</ENAMEX> .
" In a rural area like this , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> , " family members work together , and everybody shares equally in the success . "
Not surprisingly , of course , he has seen quarrels arise in other families over who does the most work and who goofs off , who 's getting rich and who 's not , but in the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> family , at least , harmony has been the key to success .
All <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> brothers are hard - working and frugal .
Each one married through a matchmaker , and none of them ever had an album of wedding photos made .
Asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Kuo - lung</ENAMEX> , " Why should we work so hard and pinch pennies all the time just to spend our money on something like that ? "
All <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> brothers drive <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Toyota</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Camrys</ENAMEX> , purchased from the same dealer .
One can gradually save up money by running a small business , to be sure , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> states frankly , " Land is where the real money is .
It 's hard to get by just running a business . "
Because his beverage wholesaling business requires a lot of space for large warehouses , he borrowed money from friends for many years to buy land .
Little did he know when he <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> started that what he bought <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 years ago</ENAMEX> would go up in price from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 3,000</ENAMEX> per ping -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">approximately 3.3 square meters</ENAMEX> -RRB- to over <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 100,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
When you throw in the family farmland , which has not yet been divided among the brothers , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> clan is worth over <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">NT$ 100 million</ENAMEX> .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> , " Who figured prices would go up like they have ?
We did n't buy the land as an investment .
We 're not greedy enough to even think in those terms .
We just bought it because we needed it for our business . "
Sacrificing for the kids
Although they may be loath to spend frivolously on themselves , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> and his wife consider money no object when it comes to their children 's education .
" The reason we worked so hard around the clock for so many years was because we were afraid that we might not be able to do right by our kids .
We were worried that they might fall in with the wrong crowd after they got into junior high , " says Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> , adding that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taihsi</ENAMEX> is well known for the fact that it has " lots of dust in the air , lots of yams , and lots of gangsters . "
To keep their kids out of trouble they sent all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> of them off to a well - known <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Catholic</ENAMEX> boarding school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Touliu</ENAMEX> as soon as they reached junior high .
Each child spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</ENAMEX> there -LRB- except for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> daughter , who only attended for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and every weekend the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> parents would pack up lots of goodies and take the bus to see their kids .
It was a difficult trip , and required several transfers .
The total cost of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one year 's</ENAMEX> tuition plus room and board at the private school came to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than NT$ 150,000</ENAMEX> per child .
With <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> kids at the school , the financial burden was substantial , especially considering the fact that they were spending these sums back in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1980s</ENAMEX> .
The struggle to pay tuition took every ounce of energy they had .
" That 's the responsibility you bear as a parent .
You want to see your children succeed , " says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> .
Luckily , all <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> of his children were good students and had no problem passing their university entrance examinations .
In their little hometown , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> and his siblings are noted for their excellent academic achievements .
The result has been a bit comical in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least one</ENAMEX> respect , for the eldest daughter was so strictly observant of the prohibition against speaking <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> in school -LRB- a rule formerly enforced throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> -RRB- that she does n't even speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> very well any more .
After graduating from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Taiwan Normal University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> , she came back to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunlin County</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</ENAMEX> to teach senior high school in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Touliu</ENAMEX> , and now she makes people laugh every time she opens her mouth to speak her odd brand of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Taiwanese</ENAMEX> .
It makes for an amusing contrast with her grandmother , who does n't speak <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Mandarin</ENAMEX> well at all .
In the view of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> , the heavy emphasis that rural parents put on education does n't have so much to do with the idea of getting ahead , but stems mainly from a deep respect for learning .
His parents are not interested in his specialty , nor do they know anything about it , but they have never objected to his chosen path , nor did they say a word when his younger brother switched his major from business management to sociology .
This long leash is all the more impressive in view of the fact that there is no chance that either of these sociology majors will ever be able to make a living near home -LRB- because there are no major universities or research institutions in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunlin County</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
" Thinking back on it , I realize that our parents began encouraging us very early to aim high and not feel like we had to stay near home .
We all started boarding school at age <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">twelve</ENAMEX> and then went on to university in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> .
As we got older , we went back home less and less . "
Their studies ended up weakening their ties to their hometown , notes <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> wistfully .
Their parents , in the meantime , are doing everything they can to make it easier for the children to come back home if necessary .
For starters , they 've built a multi-story house with a separate floor set aside for each of the children .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - lo</ENAMEX> explains , " Our <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> boys have n't started working or gotten married yet .
I hope they 'll be able to make a go of it off in some city , but if it does n't work out they can always come back and tend the store . "
It would probably make better business sense , in fact , to close the store .
People have been moving away from the haikou area for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">many years</ENAMEX> , and the local economy is in the doldrums .
What 's more , it will only get more and more difficult to make money running an old - fashioned mom and pop store now that a new convenience store has opened up across the street .
Even so , the couple is n't yet ready to call it quits .
It is for their children 's sake that they stay in business .
Living next to heavy industry
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Less than ten kilometers</ENAMEX> away in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mailiao</ENAMEX> stands <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Formosa Plastic Group 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">sixth</ENAMEX> naphtha cracker complex .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Jui - ting</ENAMEX> points out that even though <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Formosa Plastics</ENAMEX> uses a lot of foreign laborers from southeast <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> , the complex has also hired a lot of local people , and since the plant went into operation he does n't seem to see so many young people hanging out in the area 's small towns with nothing to do .
Even though the seawall built to protect the plant has blocked people 's view of the sea , and in spite of worries about the possibility of mercury pollution in the soil , the extra employment has won the plant a lot of local support .
Says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> , " I always say , if you 've got work , you 've got food on the table .
Do n't go around complaining about the pay being too low .
It used to take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four days</ENAMEX> to earn <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one dou</ENAMEX> of rice .
Now you can earn over <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">ten dou</ENAMEX> in just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">one day</ENAMEX> .
If that 's not enough for you , then you might as well go starve to death . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> and his younger brothers do n't expect a lot from the government .
At most , they express nostalgia for the days when former general <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hau Pei - tsun</ENAMEX> served as premier , because " they arrested a lot of criminals when he was in charge . "
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing that really irks them now is national health insurance .
" When you run your own business like we do , " says youngest brother <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai Kuo - lung</ENAMEX> , " a family of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> like ours has to pay over NT$ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">60,000</ENAMEX> per year in premiums for national health insurance .
That 's a lot more expensive than labor insurance or farmer 's insurance .
What 's more , he adds , there are no major hospitals in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunlin County</ENAMEX> , so if you get sick you 've got to go all the way to the next county .
Not only that , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsai</ENAMEX> , the deductible for medicine was jacked up " ridiculously high " <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , and everyone is complaining bitterly about it .
Hoping for more democracy
When the subject turns to politics and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> independence , the normally outspoken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Chien - lo</ENAMEX> suddenly grows cautious .
" It does n't matter who wins the election .
They 're all good candidates .
We 'll just have to wait and see . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> understands the reasons for his father 's reticence quite well .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yunlin County</ENAMEX> politics are riddled with factionalism and the influence of organized crime , and you can find ample proof here that all politics are indeed local .
With over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">40</ENAMEX> voters in the extended family , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu</ENAMEX> clan is a plum of a voting block .
All the local factions eagerly woo <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chien - lo</ENAMEX> , who has in the past gotten deeply involved in politics and taken to the streets in support of certain candidates .
Over the years , however , he has learned that it is best to avoid offending people , and he now plays his cards close to the vest .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wu Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> explains that local politics in the haikou area are linked only tenuously to what goes on in distant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taipei</ENAMEX> , and the concept of democracy has n't made much headway here .
The locals are most concerned about what public figure " gives people face " by showing up at weddings and funerals , and who has close personal ties with whom .
What is more , vote buying is accepted with breezy indifference , as if it were the normal thing to do .
However , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tsung - sheng</ENAMEX> , local politics probably wo n't be so dirty once the younger generation becomes more influential .
