When <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> started *-1 to take off in <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> in 1995 *T*-2 , <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Inforian</COREF> was one of the first <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> startups .
In the years since <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has made quite a splash in the industry .
Back when <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> in <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> mainly meant college students posting on bulletin boards and fooling around with Mosaic *T*-1 , <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">a 23 - year - old graduate student at National Chengchi University named * * Heidi Hsueh</COREF> and a graduate student at National Taiwan University named * *PRO* Lawrence Ho</COREF> decided *PRO*-2 to form an <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> company together .
<COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> started with just NT$ 500,000 .
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh , who *T*-1 speaks with all the self - confidence of a prophet</COREF> , recalls that <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could early on see the tremendous impact that <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> was going *-2 to have *T*-3 on people s lives .
" <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> were riding that first wave , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh , who *T*-2 points out that *PRO* deciding *PRO* to strike at the right time is the first step to success</COREF> .

*PRO* Starting with books
In <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the early period</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Inforian - or pAsia as <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is known *-1 today -</COREF> made money by publishing books and by *PRO* localizing software for the <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> market .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hsueh</COREF> , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the co-founder and executive vice president</COREF></COREF> , ca n't count how many times <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> stayed up all night at the office in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">those early days</COREF> *T*-1 .
Once , when <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> distributor for some reason refused *PRO*-1 to make payments *T*-3 , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had *-2 to endure two months without any incoming revenue .
" When you 're considering *PRO*-1 founding a company *T*-2 , " <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says *?* , *PRO*-6 issuing a warning to <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the many youths throwing <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> into <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> startups</COREF> , " you 've really got *-3 to consider carefully the pressures 0 you 're going *-5 to be under *T*-4 . "
The division of labor was clear from the start .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Ho</COREF> was responsible for product design , and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh</COREF> handled business development and marketing strategy .
After two years , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> had <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> first success</COREF> : <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the <COREF ID="ectb_1038.part-001-E7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">IQ97</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="ectb_1038.part-001-E7" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Inforian</COREF> Quest</COREF> -RRB- meta - search engine</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> hit a homerun for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> dreams .
Not long after <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Ho</COREF> finished <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">IQ97</COREF> , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh</COREF> sent <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the American website ZDNet</COREF> , which *T*-1 awarded <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">five stars</COREF> , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> highest rating</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh</COREF> then used <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> *PRO*-1 to find distributors around <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> .
Soon <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">IQ97</COREF> had been translated *-1 into seven languages and plans *ICH*-3 were laid *-2 *PRO* to step into the global market .
Within a year of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the product 's</COREF> release in October of 1997 , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had sold three million copies worldwide .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Inforian</COREF> followed by *PRO* launching <COREF ID="106" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">CICQ</COREF> , <COREF ID="106" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Chinese language instant messaging site that *T*-1 attracted 1 million members from around <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF></COREF> .
Then in <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">1998</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> focused on e-commerce , *PRO*-1 establishing the online auction site CoolBid , which *T*-2 has averaged quarterly sales of NT$ 60 million and has as many as 100,000 members .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh</COREF> also made plans *PRO* to forge alliances with world - famous companies .
In <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">1998</COREF> , after *PRO* seeing <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh 's</COREF> strategic alliance plan , <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Intel</COREF> joined <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Inforian</COREF> as a strategic partner .
Later , <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> decided *PRO*-1 to take a stake in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> .
It was the first time 0 <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Intel</COREF> had ever invested in an Asian Internet company *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Inforian , or pAsia as <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is now known *-1 ,</COREF> has grown from four employees to a staff of several hundred , and has become a multinational with offices in the United States and on the mainland , as well as in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .

The <COREF ID="ectb_1038-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> lifestyle
" At <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">pAsia</COREF> <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> emphasize that <COREF ID="ectb_1038-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> is a kind of technological art that *T*-1 allows <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> to improve <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lifestyle , " <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh</COREF> says *T*-2 .
" <COREF ID="ectb_1038-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is a work of art that *T*-1 requires creativity *PRO*-1 to be whole .
<COREF ID="ectb_1038-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">The Internet</COREF> is part software , part media , part databank , and part communications device .
<COREF ID="ectb_1038-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's the best possible space for *PRO* making the most out of creativity .
" On the front door to <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> office on Hsinyi Road</COREF> , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Leonardo DaVinci , Albert Einstein</COREF> and the <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">pAsia</COREF> logo</COREF> grace each other with <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> respective presences .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh</COREF> notes that <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">those two historical figures '</COREF> hard work and creativity changed the way 0 people live *T*-1 .
This is also the spirit that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">pAsia</COREF> wishes *PRO*-2 to project *T*-1 .
As far as <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh</COREF> is concerned *-1 , <COREF ID="ectb_1038-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> <COREF ID="ectb_1038.part-002-E4" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> both a tool and a communications platform .
<COREF ID="ectb_1038-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> companies , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> believes *?* , should reflect <COREF ID="ectb_1038.part-002-E4" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
As one such company , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">pAsia</COREF> must be flexible , efficient and practice what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> preaches *T*-1 .
The intranet at <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">pAsia</COREF> , for instance , provides chatrooms , vacation request forms , work guidelines , business travel forms , and even a bulletin board for *PRO* selling workers ' second - hand stuff .
The offices have neon decorations on the walls and a hallway that *T*-1 is no less stylish than a haute couture catwalk .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">The whole office</COREF> is infused *-1 with a modern and technological sensibility .
Of course , success is never guaranteed *-2 .
American Tech stocks took a tumble in April of this year , and people began *-1 to talk about an <COREF ID="ectb_1038-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> bubble .
Meanwhile , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">pAsia</COREF> has had trouble obtaining new financing and has seen rapid turnover in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> executive ranks , while rumors *ICH*-1 have circulated about <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> IPO application being rejected *-2 .
Nevertheless , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Hsueh</COREF> holds that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">pAsia</COREF> has a clear niche and is very adaptable , so that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be relatively unaffected by the economic downturn .
When you see <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Heidi Hsueh 's</COREF> fresh young face and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> no - nonsense approach to *PRO* doing business *T*-1 , you quickly understand how <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">members of the young generation</COREF> are realizing <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> revolutionary ideas about lifestyle and career through <COREF ID="ectb_1038-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> *T*-2 .
