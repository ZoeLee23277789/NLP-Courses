-LRB- Eric Lin / photos by Hsueh Chi - kuang / tr. * by Phil Newell -RRB-
The current fitness trend in Taiwan combines working out with recreation and the traditional Chinese idea of " health cultivation . "
Of particular interest has been *T*-1 <COREF ID="ectb_1056.part-000-E7" TYPE="IDENT">aromatherapy , with <COREF ID="ectb_1056.part-000-E7" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> new - age underpinning of the integration of " body , mind , and spirit</COREF> . "
What exactly is <COREF ID="ectb_1056.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">aromatherapy</COREF> *T*-1 ?
What can <COREF ID="ectb_1056.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> do *T*-1 for you ?
Aromatherapy involves the use of <COREF ID="ectb_1056.part-000-E5" TYPE="IDENT">" essential oils " extracted * from the flowers , leaves , branches , bark , rind , or roots of medicinal plants</COREF> .
<COREF ID="ectb_1056.part-000-E5" TYPE="IDENT">These oils</COREF> are then mixed *-1 with a " carrier " -LRB- usually a vegetable oil -RRB- or are diluted *-1 .
There are a number of different applications , including oil massages , fragrant baths , and heating of oils over a flame 0 *T*-1 to diffuse the aroma .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tang Ya - chun</COREF> , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president of Alexander Health Clubs</COREF> , says , " In fact you could consider <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">aromatherapy</COREF> the latest trend in personal care .
*PRO* To combine <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> with *PRO* working out is *PRO* to combine a beauty perspective with a health one , with more of a recreational feel . "

There 's nothing new about aroma - therapy .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">People in ancient Rome</COREF> often rubbed <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bodies with oil in the public baths as a means of *PRO* relieving stress , and <COREF ID="15" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Shen Nong</COREF> Ben Cao Jing</COREF> [ <COREF ID="16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Classic of Roots and Herbs Discovered * by <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Shen Nong</COREF></COREF> ]</COREF> , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the oldest Chinese medical treatise</COREF> , also describes treatments which *T*-1 are functionally the same as aromatherapy .
So why the sudden surge of interest ?
Perhaps there is a greater need *ICH*-1 among modern people - plagued * by stress , insomnia , anxiety , and inability *PRO* to concentrate - *PRO* to find a way 0 *PRO* to chill out *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Tang Ya - chun</COREF> states that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">most health clubs in Taiwan</COREF> combine aromatherapy with hydrotherapy , and include these treatments under <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> " spa " services .
As <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Tang</COREF> explains *?* : " In the spa , particular attention is devoted *-1 to the pleasuring and relaxation of the senses of smell , hearing , touch , taste , and vision .
Besides mellow music , soft lighting , and diffusion of fragrant oils , there is also a ' Vichy bath , ' which *T*-1 allows the skin to breathe more freely .
With an aromatherapy massage , essential oils sink in , and <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the skin</COREF> regains <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> flexibility . "
In order that <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">members</COREF> can really let <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hair down , most " spa " facilities are only open to women .
Because there have *-1 to be specialists on duty , the cost is quite high , so in most health clubs aromatherapy is available only at an additional charge .
Different fragrances have , it is said *-1 , different effects : Lavender helps with problems like tension and exhaustion .
Sandalwood promotes relaxation and tranquility .
Bergamot helps *PRO*-1 settle the mind .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Rose</COREF> is advised *-1 for inflammation and swelling , and <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> also invigorates the skin .
Chamomile relieves tension and is used *-1 for *PRO* treating menstrual cramps and insomnia .
Different oils can be combined *-1 depending on different needs .

Does aromatherapy really work ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ho Tsung - hsien</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine</COREF></COREF> , says that Chinese medicine has long included some aromatherapy - like treatments , and theoretically it *EXP*-1 is possible for the medicinal effects of oils to be transmitted *-2 to the body through the meridians *PRO* using tuina -LRB- traditional Chinese massage therapy -RRB- .
" Things used * in aroma - therapy like lavender and sandalwood definitely help people relax and sleep better , and can relieve tension and headaches , " says *T*-1 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Ho</COREF> .
" But , " <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> cautions *?* , " <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the user</COREF> has *-1 to put <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">him - or herself</COREF> in the proper frame of mind *PRO* to relax , or else the effect will be largely cancelled *-2 out . "
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> adds , moreover , that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> remains skeptical of claims of wider curative powers for aromatherapy .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">A Miss Wu , who *T*-1 sometimes goes to spas</COREF> , testifies that aromatherapy definitely helps <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mellow out .
" But at one or two thousand NT dollars per time , it 's too expensive *PRO* to go to the health club more than once in a while .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> more often buy <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">aromatic oils</COREF> and use <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> at home - *PRO*-1 just take a fragrant bath or heat the oil *PRO* to diffuse the fragrance .
That 's much more affordable . "
It *EXP*-1 is undeniable that both Tang Ya - chun and <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Miss Wu</COREF> , who *T*-2 both use aromatherapy from time to time , <COREF ID="ectb_1056-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">look</COREF> vibrant and healthy .
Is <COREF ID="ectb_1056-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> the result of " essential oils , " or is it just that people who *T*-1 would use <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">aromatherapy</COREF> are <COREF ID="ectb_1056.part-002-E13" TYPE="IDENT">the same people who *T*-2 take good care of <COREF ID="ectb_1056.part-002-E13" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> health in general</COREF> ?
Anyway , there 's no harm in *PRO* giving <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> a try yourself , and you may find your own answer .
