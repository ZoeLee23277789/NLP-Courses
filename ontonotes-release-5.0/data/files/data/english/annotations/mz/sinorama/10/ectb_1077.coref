<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">A Chinese Director</COREF> Makes <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> Mark in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF>
-LRB- Teng Sue - feng / tr. * by Jonathan Barnard -RRB-
Some people are calling the 21st cent - ury *PRO*-1 the century of the dragon , and for ethnic Chinese filmmakers there appears *-2 to be some truth to the designation .
First Ang Lee 's Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon won Golden Globes for best director and best foreign - language film as well as 10 Oscar nominations , and then Lin Cheng - sheng won the Silver Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for Betelnut Beauty .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Clara Law , who *T*-1 has earned renown in <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> for <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Floating Life</COREF> and <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">The Goddess of 1967</COREF></COREF> , is yet another ethnic Chinese filmmaker winning awards at international festivals .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> has produced a remarkably varied body of work , which *T*-1 ranges from the realistic to the mythic and includes such films as Farewell China and Temptation of a Monk .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> is especially gifted at *PRO* describing the experiences of Chinese emigrants .
How did <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Law</COREF> , <COREF ID="116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the last working woman directors from Hong Kong and Taiwan</COREF></COREF> , attain Australian government film grants after *PRO* emigrating there *T*-1 ?
*PRO*-1 Weighing only about 40 kilos , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> looks light enough *PRO* to blow away in a strong wind , so it *EXP*-2 's hard *PRO* to imagine <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> barking out orders on a film set .
But when <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> and <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband Eddie Fong</COREF></COREF> were invited *-1 *PRO*-1 to attend the Taipei Film Festival last year *T*-2 , <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Fong , who *T*-3 is also a screenwriter and director</COREF> , revealed , " <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Clara</COREF> is very strong willed , and everyone in the Australian film community knows that <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> ca n't be pushed *-4 around and rarely compromises . "
In <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">The Goddess of 1967</COREF> there is <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">a scene</COREF> where <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the girl who *T*-1 is the film 's leading character -LRB- played * by <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">Rose Byrne</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> and <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mother</COREF> encounter heavy winds in <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> car *T*-2 .
The film crew had set up the lights *PRO*-1 to shoot <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">this scene</COREF> of a dust storm , when suddenly <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">Byrne</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was hungry and wanted *PRO*-3 to rest *T*-2 .
" <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Clara</COREF> knew that <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was n't really hungry , but rather that <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> just found it difficult *PRO* to concentrate sometimes since it was the first time 0 <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had been in a film *T*-1 , so <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> told <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">Rose</COREF> that <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could n't eat .
The assistant director , who *T*-1 was Australian , looked aghast , as if <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Clara</COREF> was a witch who *T*-2 was abusing a poor child . "
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">The Goddess of 1967</COREF> refers to a '67 Chevy named " * *PRO* Goddess . "
In <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">a Japanese man</COREF> goes to <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> *PRO*-1 to find the car of <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> dreams and happens *-1 to meet a blind girl named * *PRO* B.G. -LRB- <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">Byrne</COREF> -RRB- .
<COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">The two</COREF> take to the road , *PRO*-1 hoping *PRO*-1 to find some direction to <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives .
For <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> performance , <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">Byrne</COREF> won the best actress award at last year 's Venice Film Festival .
This was the second film 0 <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> and <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Fong</COREF></COREF> had made *T*-1 with Australian government money since <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> immigrated there in 1994 .

*PRO* Finding direction
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> explains that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> decision *PRO* to move to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> was a well - laid plan , not a spur - of - the - moment thing .
In 1993 - 1994 , after *PRO* shooting Fruit Punch and Temptation of a Monk in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the couple</COREF> went to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> *PRO*-1 to visit relatives and rest .
It was then that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> discovered that the technical level of the Australian film industry was very high *T*-1 .
" The biggest problem with *PRO* making films in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> is the lack of money budgeted * for post-production , " <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> notes *T*-1 .
" Dolby sound costs a lot of money . "
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were extremely disappointed *-1 with <COREF ID="ectb_1077.part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the sound on <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Autumn Moon</COREF></COREF> , so <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> decided *PRO*-2 to go to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> *PRO*-2 to redo <COREF ID="ectb_1077.part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
When <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the film</COREF> was subsequently presented *-1 at the Sydney film festival *T*-2 , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was well received , and this brought <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> into contact with Australian producers .
" Originally , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> thought that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were just changing workplaces and would spend half the year in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> *PRO* writing and then half the year in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> *PRO* shooting , " <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> says *T*-2 .
" <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> did n't expect that it *EXP*-1 would be <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> destiny *PRO* to put down roots in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> . "
Faced with Hollywood 's cultural onslaught , <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">governments around the world</COREF> are offering grants 0 *T*-1 to protect <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own film industries .
Last year <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the Australian government</COREF> budgeted more than A$ 40 million *U* -LRB- the equivalent of NT$ 700 million *U* -RRB- for this purpose .
As long as <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">a film</COREF> has an outstanding plan and the backing of a production company and a distributor , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has a chance at *PRO* getting a grant .
The amount of the grants vary , depending on the topic of a film .
For The Goddess of 1967 , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the Australian government</COREF> provided nearly NT$ 50 million *U* , or 70 % of the total budget , Fong explains *T*-1 .
Furthermore , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> allowed <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the director</COREF> to exercise creative control .
The only problem was that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> imposed strict deadlines and a quota of jobs that *T*-1 had *-1 to be filled *-1 by Australians , and <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stipulated that Australian actors must be given *-2 first priority .
So as *PRO* to seek creative inspiration and find new material in a foreign land , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the two</COREF> bought a four - wheel - drive SUV and explored all over <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> .
The desert both frightened and intrigued <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> : " <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> gradually began *-2 to feel that <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">this ancient landscape</COREF> was well suited to *PRO* showing the loneliness of modern people , " <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> recalls *T*-1 .
" <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a good match for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> films . "

Culture clash
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Law , who *T*-1 has now finished nine films</COREF> , was born *-2 in Macao in 1957 .
In 1978 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> graduated from the University of Hong Kong with a degree in English literature and found work in television .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> directed 12 different TV movies before *PRO* going to London *ICH*-2 *PRO* to get <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> masters in 1982 , where <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> majored in screenplay writing and directing *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> thesis project</COREF> , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">They Say 0 the Moon Is Fuller</COREF> , won a silver medal at the Chicago Film Festival .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> first film after graduating</COREF> was the 1988 work The Other Half and the Other Half , which *T*-1 explored the uncomfortable problem of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">spouses being separated *-2 by national boundaries , a familiar situation in <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> , which *T*-3 is a cradle of emigration</COREF> .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was the first Hong Kong film 0 *T*-1 to deal with <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">this theme</COREF> .
" <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> grew up amid two cultures , " <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> recalls *T*-1 .
" When <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was little *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> grandfather taught <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *PRO*-2 to read Chinese poems and do calligraphy .
Then , when <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> entered <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> school *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> learned how *PRO* to think in <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> *T*-2 .
It was n't until <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> went abroad for three years that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> discovered 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was in fact neither Chinese nor English *T*-1 . "
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> says that from a young age <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">all Hong Kongers</COREF> learned that <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were living in a borrowed place on borrowed time .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> childhood friends would all go abroad *PRO*-1 to study .
Yet <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> movies were n't acknowledging this problem .
Since movies were regarded *-1 merely as entertainment , <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">studio bosses</COREF> were n't willing *PRO*-2 to invest in <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">films on these sort of topics</COREF> , for <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't think that audiences would come *PRO*-3 to see <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="107" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Law 's</COREF> second film</COREF> , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Reincarnation of Golden Lotus</COREF></COREF> , was a modern adaptation of a classical Chinese novel about the unusual woman Pan Jin - lian .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a more polished work than <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> first film</COREF> .
" Although the story is intentionally macabre , " noted *?* the <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> critic Shek Kei , " <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the film</COREF> displays <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Law 's</COREF> own style and succeeds with both <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> twists of plot and <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> portrayal of desire and *PRO* killing for love .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> also does a good job of *PRO* giving Joey Wang , who *T*-1 plays the reincarnation of an ancient Chinese courtesan , a darkly beautiful aura .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">The film</COREF> is visually interesting and entertaining .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> has created a new model for *PRO* shooting mythic - type Chinese films . "

<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Red Dust</COREF> ended up *-1 winning eight Golden Horses , and <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">Farewell China</COREF> took only three , including a best leading actor award for <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Tony Leung</COREF> .
Nevertheless , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the film</COREF> received excellent notices from critics .
Although <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> may have lost out in the competition for awards , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the film</COREF> still earned <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> renown .
Some , however , criticized the story for *PRO* being excessively grim .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The film</COREF> describes <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">a Chinese couple who *T*-1 are anxious *PRO*-1 to get out of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF></COREF> .

<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> ca n't speak English , and is penniless and destitute after <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> money is stolen *-1 by some homeless people .
After <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> accidentally kills a Chinese gangster , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> meets up with <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">a young ethnic Chinese girl</COREF> and acts as <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> pimp , *PRO*-1 losing all dignity .

The various tragedies depicted * in <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the film</COREF> are rather hard 0 *PRO* to take *T*-1 .
One critic wrote , " <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The director</COREF> lays on the tragedy a little too thick .
When <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the couple</COREF> by chance meet up *T*-1 , one might expect a happy ending .
But instead we get <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">a crazy woman murdering <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband</COREF> in front of the Statue of Liberty</COREF> .
It 's a bit over the top . "
Nevertheless , some viewers could identify with the plot .
In one scene <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Cheung 's</COREF> character</COREF> bicycles home to <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> run - down apartment with a discarded mattress on <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> back .

Much to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> surprise , the awards committee refused <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> application because <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the film</COREF> lacked a distributor in Taiwan .
Although *PRO* not allowed *PRO* to compete for a Golden Horse , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> won <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the Gold Leopard Award</COREF> at the Locarno Film Festival in Switzerland , and with <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">this award</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> began *-2 to receive notice in the international film community .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Autumn Moon , which *T*-1 was shot *-1 with Japanese money</COREF> , depicts <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">a Japanese man who *T*-2 goes to Hong Kong as a tourist when <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is bored with <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life *T*-3</COREF> .

<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">This " Japanese older brother "</COREF> becomes <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> close friend , and <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> often takes <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> home *PRO*-1 to eat meals cooked * by <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> grandmother</COREF> .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">The three of them</COREF> talk past each other , but <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are very much like a family , and these scenes are quite amusing .

The result , both in terms of <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> visual and narrative techniques , was much more accessible .
Unlike Farewell China , which *T*-1 depicts a tragedy in a foreign land , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Floating Life</COREF> explores the problem of the generation gap between the first and second generation of Chinese emigrants and the clash between Chinese and Western culture .

We should try *PRO*-1 to adopt longer - term perspectives , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says *?* , because in the end we 're all going *-2 to meet our maker .
The vast , virgin expanses of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the Australian continent</COREF> have sparked a new creative fire in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> .
The Goddess of 1967 adopts such techniques used * in television commercials as exaggerated contrasts of brightness , grainy film , and oversaturation of color .
" The wonderfully weird visual style differs greatly from <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> old works , " notes *T*-1 the program of the Taipei Film Festival .
" It 's the new Australian Law , not the old Hong Kong Law . "
The Australian government was quite pleased with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the film made * by this scriptwriting and directing couple</COREF> and has chosen <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Floating Life</COREF> *PRO*-1 to be one of eight official Australian entrants at international film festivals .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Law</COREF> seems *-4 to have found new creative energy in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Australia</COREF> , where both <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> works have been about how <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> try *PRO*-1 to find <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> in the modern world *T*-2 *T*-3 .
" Although we do n't know where we 're going *T*-1 , it is our journey .
We hope that audiences will take to the road with us . "
