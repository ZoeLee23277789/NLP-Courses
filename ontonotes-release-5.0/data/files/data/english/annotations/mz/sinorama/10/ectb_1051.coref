-LRB- Chuang Chih / tr. * by David Mayer -RRB-
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">The prospect of *PRO* emigrating to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Shang - hai</COREF></COREF> has caught the imagination of middle - class Taiwanese in recent years , and waves of business persons have been pouring into <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> since the early 1990s .
But is <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> really such a good idea ?
What *T*-2 happens when a Taiwanese expatriate settles in <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese businessman Chen Pin , who *T*-1 moved to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> a decade ago</COREF> , has written of <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> experiences in <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">*PRO* Emigrating to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> , which *T*-2 has sold like hotcakes since <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was published *-3 just last October by Shang Hsun Cultural Publishing Company</COREF> .
When you think of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> *T*-1 , what *T*-2 comes to mind ?
The grand promenade and European - style buildings along the Bund ?
The bustling shopping district where foreigners congregated in the days of the foreign concessions *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Du Yuesheng</COREF> and <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-000-E2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> notorious <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> Green Gang ?

Big city , tricky ropes
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Chen Pin</COREF> opened <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first business in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> over ten years ago .
In the intervening years <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has run a bread factory , restaurants , and a fast food shop .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> son is treated *-1 as a <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-001-E2" TYPE="IDENT">PRC</COREF> citizen , and attends university in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-001-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">*PRO*-1 A survivor of many ups and downs <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-001-E1" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chen</COREF></COREF> gives detailed descriptions of many of the problems faced * by Taiwanese business persons in <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-001-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">The book</COREF> describes <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the property market</COREF> , cross-strait marriage , *PRO* starting a business , children 's education , shopping , recreation , and more .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> does not stop at mere description , however .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also offers suggestions on how *PRO* to cope with a wide range of difficulties *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">This book</COREF> can serve as a " how to " manual for those who *T*-1 would follow in this footsteps .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> offers a lot of very useful insights into <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> property market</COREF> .
All land is owned *-1 by <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-001-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> , so when you buy <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">a building</COREF> *T*-2 , you do n't gain outright ownership .
All 0 you get *T*-1 is the right *PRO* to use <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Property in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> is divided *-1 into various categories , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> explains various terms used * in <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-001-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the PRC</COREF> .
" Foreign business buildings " can be purchased *-1 by foreign - invested enterprises and persons with a foreign passport .
Buildings sold * on the domestic market to <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-001-E2" TYPE="IDENT">PRC</COREF> firms are called *-1 *PRO*-1 shang pin fang , or literally , " commercial buildings . "
Buildings owned * by <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-001-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> are called *-1 *PRO*-1 gong fang , or " public buildings . "
Buildings owned * by private individuals are called *-2 *PRO*-2 si fang , or " private buildings . "
If you 've paid all your property taxes , you are given *-1 a da chan zheng , or " big " property certificate .
If you have n't yet paid , you can only get a " small " property certificate , and you ca n't sell your property .
Some buildings can be bought *-1 with a loan , but others ca n't *?* .
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Newly arrived Taiwanese business persons</COREF> often make bad judgments if <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> plunge into <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> without *PRO* studying <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> carefully first , so <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> suggests the following rules of thumb : <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> property market</COREF> is in a slump , so there is no need *PRO* to rush into a purchase .
A buyer must be very clear about the purpose of any property purchase .
It *EXP*-1 is safest *PRO* to buy property from <COREF ID="162" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Shanghai Municipal Government</COREF> , <COREF ID="162" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the biggest and most reliable real estate developer in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF></COREF> .
One must not estimate potential earnings on the basis of experience in Taiwan .
You get more for money *ICH*-3 when *PRO* renting *T*-2 than when *PRO* buying *T*-1 .
You must stand on your rights at all times , and be very careful *PRO* not to let <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">friends and relatives</COREF> use <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> personal ties *PRO* to take advantage of you .

Secrets to success
When <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">hard - charging Taiwanese businessmen</COREF> meet up with <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> smooth - talking <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> counterparts *T*-1 , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Taiwanese</COREF> often come away with the short end of the stick .
From the vendors at open - air markets hawking crabs or pears , to the proprietors of five - star clubs that *T*-1 target a foreign clientele , everyone in <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> looks at Taiwanese business persons the same way :
" Oh boy , here comes <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-002-E8" TYPE="IDENT">an easy mark</COREF> !
*PRO* Let 's skin <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-002-E8" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 alive ! "
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> laments , " <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The old lady</COREF> at the market sells beans to everybody else at 80 cents per jin , but <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> jacks up the price on <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> to two dollars . "
And this is only a cut - and - dried business transaction .
Personal relationships and marriage get a lot more complicated .
Taiwanese men tend *-1 to <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E3" TYPE="IDENT">fall</COREF> like a ton of bricks for <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the pretty , sweet - talking women in <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E3" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> signals the beginning of all sorts of problems .
Single men practically shout it out : " My girlfriend is in <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> . "
Those who *T*-1 already have wives in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> will tell you in a low whisper : " I 've got <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">a mistress</COREF> in <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> , and I 'm taking care of all <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> expenses . "
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">The women of <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF></COREF> are well known for <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> liberated ways , and it *EXP*-1 is no simple matter for <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwanese men</COREF> there to handle <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> business and emotional affairs wisely .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> argues that *PRO* allowing direct travel between <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> and <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> would make it *EXP*-1 much more difficult for Taiwanese men to keep mistresses in <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the mainland</COREF> , and would go a long way toward *PRO* clearing up all the cross-strait marital and romantic problems that *T*-2 now occur so often .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Chen</COREF> offers several pieces of advice for <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-002-E9" TYPE="IDENT">all who *T*-1 would head for <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> , whether alone or with <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-002-E9" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> families</COREF> .
Shopping :
" You should establish a reputation for *PRO* being tight - fisted . "
When you buy things *T*-1 , *PRO* pretend *PRO* not to have as much money as they 're demanding *?* .
*PRO* Ask questions , and keep * asking until you get clear answers before you pay anybody any money .
Also , *PRO* keeping a low profile is a means of self - defense .
You should be careful *PRO* not to flaunt knowledge or ability .
General attitude :
" <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">The Taiwanese</COREF> are considered *-1 uncultured boors in spite of <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> wealth .
*PRO* Live down that image .
*PRO* Be humble .
*PRO* Get *PRO* to know the daily lives of people in <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> . "
*PRO* Looking out for No. 1 :
" You must understand that undercurrents in <COREF ID="ectb_1051-part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> are strong .
It *EXP*-1 's hard *PRO* to stay afloat , and <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">many people</COREF> enjoy watching your struggle ; <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're hoping 0 you 'll go under .
You have *-1 to understand the legal systems and government policies .
You have *-1 to know how *PRO* to operate under the table *T*-2 .
Markets change overnight , and personal relationships are ambiguous .
*PRO* Trust no one , for no one is looking *PRO*-1 to save you a penny or help you earn a bit extra .
You 're on your own . "

You 're not in Taiwan anymore
In both emotional and historical terms , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> seems *-1 very near , but in fact <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a very unfamiliar place .
Our dreams , yearnings , and imaginings blind us to the truth , and this especially true of Taiwanese business persons .
The book 's subtitle , A Meeting of " the Taiwanese Experience " and Shanghai Style , hints at the conflicts inherent in the relationship .
Although <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the people on the two sides of the Taiwan Strait</COREF> share a common language and ethnicity , <COREF ID="ectb_1051.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> long separation has given rise to sharply divergent values and ways of thinking .
When <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">someone from <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF></COREF> says , " This is n't a big problem *T*-1 , " you have *-2 to realize that <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has just acknowledged that there 's <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">a problem</COREF> , and it *EXP*-3 's up to you *PRO* to figure out how serious <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> really is *T*-4 .
Taiwanese ways do n't fly in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> .
Do you want *PRO*-1 to eat the famous steamed mantou buns at Nanxiang Restaurant ?
*PRO* Shop for antiques ?
*PRO* Visit <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Zhouzhuang</COREF> , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the so - called " Venice of the Orient "</COREF> ?
*PRO* Before you take off , do your homework .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Shanghai</COREF> is a big city , after all , and there are plenty of " crouching dragons and hidden tigers " lurking in the shadows .
