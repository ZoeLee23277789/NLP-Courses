A spokeswoman for <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Ogilvy -AMP- Mather</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the agency</COREF> does n't comment on `` idle speculation . ''
Also mentioned as a contender was *T*-1 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">TBWA Advertising</COREF> , but <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> denied 0 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was participating .
The loss of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the cigarette account</COREF> would be a severe blow to <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Wells Rich</COREF> .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Benson -AMP- Hedges</COREF> has been one of <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> most high - visibility campaigns , as well as one of <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> largest clients .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The account</COREF> billed almost $ 60 million *U* last year , according to Leading National Advertisers .
But <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Philip Morris</COREF> has scaled back ad spending on <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the brand</COREF> over the past year , industry executives said 0 *?* , and <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> now bills about $ 30 million to $ 40 million *U* .

According to <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Maxwell</COREF> , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an analyst at Wheat First Securities , Richmond , Va.</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Benson -AMP- Hedges</COREF> has <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">slipped</COREF> from 4.7 % of the cigarette market in 1985 to just 4.1 % after the second quarter of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The brand</COREF> is No. 7 overall in the cigarette business , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Maxwell</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">The slip</COREF> has come despite high - profile ads created * by <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Wells Rich</COREF> , including <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">one picturing <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">a young man clad * only in pajama bottoms interrupting a festive brunch</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">That ad</COREF> generated so much publicity that <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">a trade magazine</COREF> launched a contest for <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> readers to guess who <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the guy</COREF> was *T*-1 and what <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was doing *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Wells Rich</COREF> first popularized <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the Benson -AMP- Hedges brand</COREF> more than 20 years ago with ads portraying , among other things , an elevator door closing on a passenger 's cigarette .

<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Philip Morris , trying *PRO*-1 to revive <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the Benson -AMP- Hedges franchise</COREF> ,</COREF> put <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the account</COREF> up for <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">review</COREF> in 1986 .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Wells Rich Greene</COREF> , however , in an effort directed * by Mary Wells Lawrence , emerged the victor of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the review</COREF> and retained <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the business</COREF> .
