<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> , having rid itself of asbestos , now sells fiberglass , forest products , minerals and industrial goods .
Heady stuff it 's not .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> 's ownership is unusual , and it has caught the eye of some canny -- and patient -- investors .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> - based concern , which emerged from bankruptcy - law proceedings <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last year</ENAMEX> , is controlled by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Manville Personal Injury Settlement Trust</ENAMEX> .
The trust , which owns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> 's stock on a fully diluted basis , is a separate legal entity that is settling claims with asbestos victims .
When and if the trust runs out of cash -- which seems increasingly likely -- it will need to convert its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> stock to cash .
But as an <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> owner , if it tried to sell much of its stock in the market , it would likely depress the price of its shares .
Some investors say there is a good chance that the trust will , instead , seek to convert the company 's shares to cash , in some sort of friendly restructuring that would n't involve just dumping stock on the market .
`` Their principal asset is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> common stock , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Halis</ENAMEX> , who runs <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sabre Associates</ENAMEX> , an investment fund that owns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> shares .
`` If they tried to sell , they 'd be chasing their own tail .
What makes the most sense is to find someone who wants to buy the whole company or cause a recapitalization of all shares . ''
The trust is n't commenting on when it might need to liquefy its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> stock .
However , the trust 's cash flow from investments is far short of its payments to asbestos victims .
Its cash and liquid securities fell by <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 338 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first six months of 1989</ENAMEX> .
The trust also will receive <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</ENAMEX> a year starting in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</ENAMEX> on a bond it holds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> .
And , beginning in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</ENAMEX> , it will have a claim on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">as much as 20 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> net income .
Even so , the trust would seem to be facing a cash crunch .
As of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June 30</ENAMEX> , it had settled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only about 15,000</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">81,000</ENAMEX> received claims from asbestos victims , for an average of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">40,424</ENAMEX> each .
-LRB- The average should drop over time , since the most expensive claims are being settled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
And as of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">midyear</ENAMEX> , settled but unpaid claims amounted to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 136 million</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</ENAMEX> the trust 's total of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 268 million</ENAMEX> in cash and marketable securities .
`` At some point , we 're going to need an infusion of funds , '' a person close to the trust says .
Even before then , the trust may be eager to unload <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> stock .
It does n't pay a dividend , and this trust needs income .
Moreover , with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">88 %</ENAMEX> of its assets tied up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> , the trust is badly in need of diversification .
`` Obviously , a diversified portfolio would have less risk , '' the person close to the trust says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> itself does n't rule out a restructuring .
Though the ink is barely dry on its new , post-bankruptcy law structure , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Bullock</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> 's head of investor relations , says the company is continually pondering `` whether there is a better way to be structured .
We understand that the trust is ultimately going to need to sell some of our shares , '' he says .
Of course , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> option would be for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> to buy out the trust 's shares -- which would do little to benefit public stockholders .
But the trust , in most cases , is forbidden from seeking a buyer for only its shares before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1993</ENAMEX> .
And both the trust and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> are seeking to avoid the bad publicity that , in the asbestos era , tarred the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> name .
Thus , analysts say , the trust is unlikely to do anything that would hurt <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> 's other shareholders .
`` This is a rare case of a company with a big majority holder which will probably act in the interests of the minority holders , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> investor says .
Even if there is no restructuring , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> seems to be attractive long - term .
Its stock , at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">9 5/8</ENAMEX> , trades at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 8 1/2</ENAMEX> times estimated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</ENAMEX> earnings -- an appropriately low multiple for a company with recession - sensitive customers .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bullock</ENAMEX> says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</ENAMEX> of revenues are tied to construction .
Analysts predict little or no near - term growth .
They are , nonetheless , high on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> 's management .
`` It 's one of the best in the business , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Salomon Brothers</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen Dobi</ENAMEX> .
And he says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> has the financial flexibility to buy other companies at the best possible moment when other construction - related firms are hurting and selling cheap .
With a conservative debt - to - equity ratio of 1 - to - <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> -- and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 329 million</ENAMEX> in cash -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> is indeed actively on the prowl .
So far , as a price - conscious shopper , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> has n't bought much .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kleinaitis</ENAMEX> , an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Duff -AMP- Phelps</ENAMEX> , says , `` Even though they have borrowing power , they have been disciplined about acquisitions . ''
And Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kleinaitis</ENAMEX> says that with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> of its stock in friendly hands , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manville</ENAMEX> is the rare publicly traded company that can ignore short - term stock fluctuations and plan for the long haul .
