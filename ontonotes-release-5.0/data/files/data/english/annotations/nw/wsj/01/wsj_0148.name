A nickname for measures to stop the market from plunging too far too fast .
Several moves were taken following the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1987</ENAMEX> crash to coordinate -- and sometimes deliberately disconnect -- the stock and futures markets in times of heightened volatility .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> , a `` side car '' is put into effect when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> futures rise or fall <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> points .
The side car routes program trades into a special computer file that scans for imbalances of buy and sell orders .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> , S-AMP-P 500 futures are not allowed to fall further than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> points from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous day 's</ENAMEX> close for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">half an hour</ENAMEX> .
If , when trading resumes , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> futures fall <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> points from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous day 's</ENAMEX> close , a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one - hour</ENAMEX> trading halt takes effect .
Also , the reforms allow <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> to halt trading for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one hour</ENAMEX> if the Dow Jones Industrial Average falls <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> points , and for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">two more hours</ENAMEX> if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> slides <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">an additional 150</ENAMEX> points on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the same day</ENAMEX> .
DOT System -- The `` Designated Order Turnaround '' System was launched by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March 1976</ENAMEX> , to offer automatic , high - speed order processing .
A faster version , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SuperDot</ENAMEX> , was launched in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> .
Used by program traders and others to zip orders into the exchange , <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">SuperDot</ENAMEX> handles <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 80 %</ENAMEX> of all orders entered at the exchange .
Futures Contracts -- Obligations to buy -LRB- for those who have purchased a contract -RRB- or deliver -LRB- for those who sold one -RRB- a quantity of the underlying commodity or financial instrument at the agreed - upon price by a certain date .
Most contracts are simply nullified by an opposite trade before they come due .
Indexing -- Many investors , mainly institutions , follow an investment strategy of buying and holding a mix of stocks to match the performance of a broad stock - market barometer such as the S-AMP-P 500 .
Many institutional index funds are active program traders , swapping their stocks for futures when profitable to do so .
Program trading -- A wide range of computer - assisted portfolio trading strategies involving the simultaneous purchase or sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">15</ENAMEX> or more stocks .
Quant -- Generally , any Wall Street analyst who employs quantitive research techniques .
The newest breed , also called `` rocket scientists '' because of their backgrounds in physics and mathematics , devise the complex hedging and trading strategies that are popularly known as program trading .
Stock - index arbitrage -- Buying or selling baskets of stocks while at the same time executing offsetting trades in stock - index futures or options .
Traders profit by trying to capture fleeting price discrepancies between stocks and the index futures or options .
If stocks are temporarily `` cheaper '' than futures , for example , an arbitrager will buy stocks and sell futures .
Stock - index futures -- Contracts to buy or sell the cash value of a stock index by a certain date .
The cash value is determined by multiplying the index number by a specified amount .
The most common program - trading vehicles are futures contracts on Standard -AMP- poor 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> - stock index -LRB- traded on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; the Major Market Index , a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> - stock index that mimics the Dow Jones Industrial Average -LRB- traded on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the chicago Board of Trade</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; and the S-AMP-P 100 options -LRB- traded on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX> , and based on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> stocks selected from the S-AMP-P 500 -RRB- .
Stock - index options -- Options give holders the right , but not the obligation , to buy -LRB- a call -RRB- or sell -LRB- a put -RRB- a specified amount of an underlying investment by a certin date at a preset price , known as the strike price .
