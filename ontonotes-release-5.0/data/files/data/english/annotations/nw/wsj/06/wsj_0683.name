A frozen mountaintop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX> may offer an important clue about whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> is warming perilously .
Researchers at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ohio State University</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lanzhou Institute of Glaciology and Geocryology</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> have analyzed samples of glacial ice in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX> and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past half - century</ENAMEX> than in any similar period in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10,000 years</ENAMEX> .
The ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> has warmed considerably in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent times</ENAMEX> , largely because of pollutants in the air , and will warm far more in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the century ahead</ENAMEX> .
A substantial warming would melt some of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> 's polar ice caps , raising the level of the oceans and causing widespread flooding of heavily populated coastal areas .
`` If you can use data to reconstruct what happened in the past , you have much more confidence in predictions for the future , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lonnie Thompson</ENAMEX> , a research scientist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ohio State</ENAMEX> who dug for and analyzed the ice samples .
To compare temperatures over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past 10,000 years</ENAMEX> , researchers analyzed the changes in concentrations of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> forms of oxygen .
These measurements can indicate temperature changes , researchers said , because the rates of evaporation of these oxygen atoms differ as temperatures change .
Analysis of ice from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Dunde ice cap</ENAMEX> , a glacial plateau in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tibet</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">17,000 feet</ENAMEX> above sea level , show that average temperatures were higher in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1937-87</ENAMEX> than in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">any other 50 - year</ENAMEX> period since before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last Ice Age</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> said .
Some climate models project that interior regions of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> would be among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> to heat up in a global warming because they are far from oceans , which moderate temperature changes .
But the ice - core samples are n't definitive proof that the so - called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> acknowledged .
According to greenhouse theories , increased carbon dioxide emissions , largely caused by burning of fossil fuels , will cause the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from escaping into space .
Skeptics say that if that 's the case , temperatures should have risen fairly uniformly over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past century</ENAMEX> , reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide .
Instead , the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Dunde</ENAMEX> ice - core record shows increasing temperatures from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1900 through the early 1950s</ENAMEX> , decreasing temperatures from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the late 1950s through the mid-1970s</ENAMEX> , then higher temperatures again through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> .
Other temperature data show similar unexplained swings .
`` Climate varies drastically due to natural causes , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thompson</ENAMEX> .
But he said ice samples from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenland</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Antarctica</ENAMEX> all show substantial signs of warming .
