<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> 's industrial production index for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> and was up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seasonally</ENAMEX> adjusted data from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Statistics Institute</ENAMEX> .
The state agency , which usually publishes the data on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> basis , but traditionally combines the index for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the two summer - holiday months</ENAMEX> , said the advance was led by output of consumer goods , which rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.5 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> and was up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.2 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
Semifinished goods turned in a strong showing , with a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> rise of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2 %</ENAMEX> and a year - on - <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> advance of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</ENAMEX> .
Food production was ahead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.3 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
Output in the capital - goods sector was ahead <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.9 %</ENAMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">monthly</ENAMEX> basis and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.7 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> .
These gains were partly offset by output of cars and other consumer durables , which eased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> 's high level .
The sector was still <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.8 %</ENAMEX> above its output levels from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> , however .
