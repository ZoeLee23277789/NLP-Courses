In a nondescript office building south of Los Angeles , human behavior is being monitored *-1 , dissected *-1 and , ultimately , manipulated *-1 .
A squiggly line snakes across a video screen , *PRO*-1 gyrating erratically as <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">subjects with hand - held computers</COREF> register <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> second - by - second reactions to a speaker 's remarks .
Agreement , disapproval , boredom and distraction all can be inferred *-1 from <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">the subjects '</COREF> twist of a dial .
In another experiment , an elaborate chart with color codes reveals how <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">people 's opinions</COREF> were shaped *-1 *T*-3 -- and how <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can be reshaped *-2 *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Donald Vinson</COREF> , who *T*-1 oversees the experiments ,</COREF> is n't some white - coated researcher .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> heads <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="168" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Litigation Sciences Inc.</COREF> , <COREF ID="168" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the nation 's largest legal consulting firm</COREF> , which *T*-1 is helping corporate America prepare for high - stakes litigation by *PRO* predicting and shaping jurors ' reactions</COREF> .
In the process , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> is quietly but inexorably reshaping <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">the world of law</COREF> .
*PRO* Little known outside <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">the legal world</COREF> but a powerhouse within , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="169" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Litigation Sciences</COREF> , <COREF ID="169" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a unit of Saatchi -AMP- Saatchi PLC</COREF> ,</COREF> employs more than 100 psychologists , sociologists , marketers , graphic artists and technicians .
Twenty - one of <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> workers are Ph. D.s .
Among other services , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the firm</COREF> provides pre-trial opinion polls , creates profiles of `` ideal '' jurors , sets up mock trials and `` shadow '' juries , coaches lawyers and witnesses , and designs courtroom graphics .
Much like <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cohorts in political consulting and product marketing , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the litigation advisers</COREF> encourage <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> clients</COREF> *PRO*-2 to play down complex or ambiguous matters , simplify <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> messages and provide <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> target audiences with a psychological craving 0 *T*-1 to make the desired choice .
With jury verdicts getting bigger all the time , companies are increasingly willing *PRO* to pay huge sums for such advice .
Recently , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> helped Pennzoil Co. win a $ 10.5 billion *U* jury verdict against Texaco Inc .
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> advised <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">the National Football League</COREF> in <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> largely successful defense of antitrust charges by the United States Football League .
And <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> helped *PRO* win defense verdicts in product - liability suits involving scores of products , ranging from Firestone 500 tires to the anti-nausea drug Bendectin .
Largely as a result , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> has more than doubled in size in the past two years .
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> 1988 revenue was $ 25 million *U* .
Meanwhile , competitors are being spawned *-1 almost daily ; some 300 new businesses -- many just one - person shops -- have sprung up .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Vinson</COREF> estimates 0 the industry 's total revenues approach $ 200 million *U* .
In any high - stakes case , you can be sure that one side or the other -- or even both -- is using litigation consultants .
Despite <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ubiquity , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the consultants</COREF> are n't entirely welcome .
Some lawyers and scholars see the social scientists ' vision of the American jury system as a far cry from the ideal presented * in civics texts and memorialized * on the movie screen .
In the film classic `` Twelve Angry Men , '' the crucible of deliberations unmasks <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">each juror 's bias</COREF> and purges <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> from *PRO*-1 playing a role in the verdict .
After hours of conflict and debate , that jury <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">focuses</COREF> on the facts with near - perfect objectivity .
In real life , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">jurors</COREF> may not always work <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">that way</COREF> , but some court observers question why <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should n't be encouraged *-1 *PRO*-3 to do so rather than be programmed *-1 not *PRO*-4 to *?* *T*-2 .
Litigation consulting is , as <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">New York trial attorney Donald Zoeller</COREF> puts it , `` highly manipulative . ''
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> adds , `` The notion 0 they try *PRO*-1 to sell *T*-2 is that juries do n't make decisions rationally .
But the <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">effort</COREF> *ICH*-1 is also being made *-2 *PRO* to try and cause jurors not to decide things rationally .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> find <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> troubling . ''
But <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Zoeller</COREF> also acknowledges that <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">consultants</COREF> can be very effective .
`` It 's gotten to the point where if the case is large enough , it *EXP*-2 's almost malpractice *PRO* not to use <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-1 , '' <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-3 .
Others complain that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the consultants ' growing influence</COREF> exacerbates the advantage of litigants wealthy enough *PRO* to afford such pricey services .
`` The affluent people and the corporations can buy <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , the poor radicals -LCB- in political cases -RCB- get <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> free , and everybody in between is at a disadvantage , and that 's not the kind of system 0 we want *T*-2 , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="173" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Amitai Etzioni</COREF> , <COREF ID="173" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a prominent sociologist who *T*-1 teaches at George Washington University</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Sophisticated trial consulting</COREF> grew , ironically , from the radical political movements of the 1960s and 1970s before *PRO*-1 finding <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> more lucrative calling in big commercial cases .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">The Harrisburg 7 trial in 1972 , in which Daniel Berrigan and others were charged *-1 with *PRO* plotting anti-war - related violence *T*-2 ,</COREF> was a landmark .
In <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">that case</COREF> , a group of left - leaning sociologists interviewed 252 registered voters around Harrisburg .
The researchers discovered that <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">Episcopalians , Presbyterians , Methodists and fundamantalist Protestants</COREF> were nearly always against the defendants ; the lawyers resolved *PRO*-1 to try *PRO*-2 to keep <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> off <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the jury</COREF> .
The defense also learned that college - educated people were uncharacteristically conservative about the Vietnam War .
A more blue - collar panel became a second aim .
Ultimately , <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">that carefully picked jury</COREF> deadlocked with a 10 - 2 vote 0 *T*-1 to acquit , and the prosecution decided *PRO*-2 not to retry the case .
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation consulting</COREF> had arrived .
<COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">The fledgling science</COREF> went corporate in 1977 when <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">International Business Machines Corp.</COREF> hired <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">a marketing professor 0 *T*-1 to help *PRO* defend <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">a complex antitrust case</COREF></COREF> *T*-3 .
The problem for <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">IBM</COREF> trial lawyers <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Thomas Barr</COREF> and <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">David Boies</COREF></COREF> was how *PRO* to make <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">such a highly technical case</COREF> understandable *T*-1 .
As <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">the trial</COREF> progressed , <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were eager *PRO*-1 to know if <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">the jury</COREF> was keeping up with <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
The solution devised * by <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the professor</COREF> was *PRO* to hire six people who *T*-1 would mirror <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">the actual jury</COREF> demographically , sit in on <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">the trial</COREF> and report their reactions to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> then briefed <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">Messrs. <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Boies</COREF> and <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">Barr</COREF> , who *T*-1 had the chance *PRO* to tilt <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> next day 's presentation accordingly</COREF> .
Thus , the `` shadow '' jury was born *-1 .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Vinson</COREF> , <COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the professor</COREF> ,</COREF> got the law bug and formed <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> .
-LRB- <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">IBM</COREF> won <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> . -RRB-
`` The hardest thing in any complex case is *PRO* to retain objectivity and , in some sense , your ignorance , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Boies of Cravath , Swaine -AMP- Moore</COREF> .
`` What you look for *T*-2 in a shadow jury is very much what you do *T*-1 when you give <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">an opening argument</COREF> to your wife or a friend and get some response to <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">A shadow jury</COREF> is a way 0 *PRO* to do that in a more systematic and organized way *T*-1 . ''
<COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">The approach</COREF> worked well in <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the recent antitrust case in which <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Energy Transportation Systems Inc.</COREF> sued Santa Fe Pacific Corp. over the transport of semi-liquefied coal *T*-1 -- the kind of case likely *PRO* to make almost anyone 's eyes glaze over</COREF> .
<COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Energy Transportation</COREF> retained <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences *ICH*-2 , at a cost of several hundred thousand dollars , 0 *T*-1 to poll , pre-try , profile and shadow</COREF> .
Just before the actual closing arguments , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the firm</COREF> put <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> to a vote of <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the five shadow jurors , each of whom *T*-2 was being paid *-1 $ 150 *U* a day</COREF> .
<COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">The jurors , who *T*-1 did n't know which side *T*-2 had retained them ,</COREF> decided for <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Energy Transportation</COREF> , and awarded $ 500 million *U* in damages .
The real jury returned days later with a $ 345 million *U* victory for <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Energy Transportation</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's just like weather forecasting , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">Energy Transportation</COREF> trial attorney Harry Reasoner of Vinson -AMP- Elkins .
`` <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's often wrong , but <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's better than *PRO* consulting an Indian rain dancer . ''
<COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">Forecasting</COREF> is only one part of <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences '</COREF> work .
*PRO* Changing the outcome of the trial is what *T*-1 really matters .
And to the uninitiated , some of <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the firm 's</COREF> approaches may seem *-1 chillingly manipulative .
Theoretically , jurors are supposed *-1 to weigh the evidence in <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">a case</COREF> logically and objectively .
Instead , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Vinson</COREF> says 0 *?* , interviews with <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">thousands</COREF> of jurors</COREF> reveal that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> start with firmly entrenched attitudes and try *PRO*-2 to shoe - horn the facts of <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> 0 *T*-3 to fit <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> views .
Pre-trial polling helps the consultants develop a profile of the right type of juror .
If it is a case in which the client seeks <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">punitive damages</COREF> *T*-1 , for example , depressed , underemployed people are far more likely *-2 to grant <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Someone with a master 's degree in classical arts who *T*-1 works in a deli would be ideal , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> advises 0 *T*-2 .
So would *?* *T*-1 someone recently divorced or widowed .
-LRB- Since <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> generally represents the defense , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> job is usually *PRO* to help the lawyers identify *RNR*-1 and remove *RNR*-1 *ICH*-2 such people from the jury . -RRB-
For personal - injury cases , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> seeks defense jurors who *T*-1 believe that <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">most people , including victims ,</COREF> get what <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> deserve *T*-2 .
Such people also typically hold negative attitudes toward the physically handicapped , the poor , blacks and women .
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">The consultants</COREF> help the defense lawyers find such jurors by *PRO*-1 asking questions about potential jurors ' attitudes toward volunteer work , or toward particular movies or books .
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> does n't make moral distinctions .
If a client needs <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">prejudiced jurors</COREF> , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the firm</COREF> will help *PRO* find <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Vinson</COREF> explains it , `` <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do n't control <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the facts</COREF> .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are what <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *T*-1 .
But any lawyer will select the facts and the strategy 0 *PRO* to employ *T*-1 .
In our system of advocacy , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the trial lawyer</COREF> is duty bound *PRO*-1 to present the best case 0 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> possibly can *?* *T*-2 . ''
Once a jury is selected *-1 , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the consultants</COREF> often continue *-2 to determine what the jurors ' attitudes are likely *-5 to be *T*-3 and help *PRO* shape the lawyers ' presentation accordingly .
Logic plays a minimal role here .
More important are *T*-2 what <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">LSI</COREF> calls *T*-1 *PRO*-4 `` <COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">psychological anchors</COREF> '' -- <COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a few focal points calculated * *PRO*-3 to appeal to the jury on a gut level</COREF> .
In one personal - injury case , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">a woman</COREF> claimed 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had been injured *-1 when <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">slipped</COREF> in a pool *T*-3 , but <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">the fall</COREF> did n't explain why <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">one of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> arms</COREF> was discolored *-2 *PRO*-5 bluish *T*-4 .
By *PRO*-1 repeatedly drawing the jury 's attention to <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the arm</COREF> , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">the defense lawyers</COREF> <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">planted</COREF> doubt about the origin of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the woman 's</COREF> injuries .
<COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">The ploy</COREF> worked .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">The defense</COREF> won .
In a classic defense of a personal - injury case , the consultants concentrate on *PRO* encouraging the jury *PRO*-1 to shift the blame .
`` The ideal defense in a case involving an accident is *PRO* to persuade the jurors *PRO*-1 to hold <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the accident victim</COREF> responsible for <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> or <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> plight , '' <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Vinson</COREF> has written *T*-2 .
Slick graphics , pre-tested * for effectiveness , also play a major role in <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences '</COREF> operation .
Studies show , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the consultants</COREF> say 0 *?* , that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> absorb <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">information</COREF> better and remember <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> longer if <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> receive <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> visually .
Computer - generated videos help .
`` <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">The average American</COREF> watches seven hours of TV a day .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are very visually sophisticated , '' explains *T*-1 <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">LSI</COREF> graphics specialist Robert Seltzer .
Lawyers remain divided about whether anything is wrong with <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">all this</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Supporters</COREF> acknowledge that <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">the process</COREF> aims *PRO*-1 to manipulate , but <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> insist that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the best trial lawyers</COREF> have always employed <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">similar tactics</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> may not have been able *PRO*-1 to articulate <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it all</COREF> , but <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Stephen Gillers</COREF> , <COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a legal ethics expert at New York University law school</COREF> .
`` What you have *T*-1 here is intuition made *PRO* manifest . ''
Many lawyers maintain that all 's fair in the adversary system as long as no one tampers with the evidence .
Others point out that lawyers in small communities have always had <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">a feel for public sentiment</COREF> -- and used <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> to advantage .
Litigation consulting is n't a guarantee of a favorable outcome .
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> concedes that in one in 20 cases <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was flatout wrong in <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> predictions .
A few attorneys offer horror stories of jobs botched * by consultants or of overpriced services -- as when one lawyer paid a consultant -LRB- not at <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">Litigation Sciences</COREF> -RRB- $ 70,000 *U* *PRO*-1 to interview a jury after a big trial and later read more informative interviews with the same jurors in The American Lawyer magazine *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Some litigators</COREF> scoff at the notion that a sociologist knows more than <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do about what *T*-1 makes a jury tick .
`` The essence of *PRO* being a trial lawyer is *PRO* understanding how people of diverse backgrounds react to you and your presentation *T*-2 , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Barry Ostrager</COREF> of Simpson Thacher -AMP- Bartlett , who *T*-1 recently won <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">a huge case on behalf of insurers against Shell Oil Co</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> used <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">consultants</COREF> in <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> but `` found <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to be virtually useless . ''
But most lawyers accept that the marketplace has spoken .
And the question *ICH*-1 remains whether <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the jury system</COREF> can maintain <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> integrity while *PRO*-2 undergoing such a skillful massage .
For more than a decade , <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="196" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Etzioni</COREF> , <COREF ID="196" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the sociologist</COREF> ,</COREF> has been a leading critic of the masseurs .
`` There 's no reason 0 *PRO* to believe that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">juries</COREF> rule inappropriately *T*-1 , '' <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
`` But the last thing 0 you want *PRO*-2 to do *T*-1 is *PRO* manipulate the subconscious *PRO*-3 to make <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> think better .
What you then do *T*-1 is 0 you make <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> think inappropriately . ''
*PRO* To hamper the work of litigation scientists , <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> suggests that courts sharply limit the number of jurors that lawyers can remove *T*-2 from the jury panel through so - called peremptory challenges -- exclusions that *T*-1 do n't require explanations .
In most civil cases , judges allow each side three such challenges .
For complex cases , judges sometimes allow many more .
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Etzioni</COREF> also suggests *PRO* forbidding anyone from *PRO*-1 gathering background information about the jurors .
-LRB- Some courts release names and addresses , and researchers can drive by houses , look up credit ratings , and even question neighbors . -RRB-
Furthermore , <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , psychologists should not be allowed *-2 to analyze jurors ' personalities .
Even some lawyers who *T*-1 have used <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">consultants</COREF> to their advantage see a need *PRO* to limit <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> impact .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="198" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Boies</COREF> , <COREF ID="198" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the first lawyer 0 *T*-1 to use Mr. Vinson 's services</COREF> ,</COREF> cautions against courts ' allowing extensive jury questioning -LRB- known * as voir dire -RRB- or giving out personal information about the jurors .
`` The more extensive the voir dire , the easier you <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">make</COREF> it *EXP*-2 *?* for that kind of research to be effective , and <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">courts</COREF> should lend <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> to <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Boies</COREF> says *T*-1 .
