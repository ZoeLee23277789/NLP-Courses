    The efforts to get to the people who are addicted, try to rehabilitate them ; if they can not be rehabilitated, at least
    to contain them ; to educate people, to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users,
    to stop this process among the young--all of these things I think are extremely important.
