Investors bailed out of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> bonds in droves <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> , *PRO* driving prices lower and boosting yields .
One bond trader estimated that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">more than $ 50 million *U* of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> general obligation bonds</COREF></COREF> were put *-1 up for <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">sale</COREF> <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Friday alone</COREF> .
While <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> represents a small percentage of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> public debt outstanding , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Friday 's</COREF> selling</COREF> followed a weeklong effort *PRO* to unload the bonds by a broad spectrum of institutional and individual investors .
`` <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've never seen so many -LCB- <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> -RCB- G.O. 's up for sale , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">another trader</COREF> .
`` Every broker has blocks of every size and maturity . ''
Municipal bond analysts said 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the sell - off</COREF> was triggered *-1 by concerns about <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> financial health</COREF> , rumors of a $ 900 million *U* bond offering coming soon , and political uncertainty .
A spokesman for <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> would n't confirm the size of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the bond issue</COREF> , but did say that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">a general obligation offering</COREF> is in the works and should be priced sometime in the next two weeks , before <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the November mayoral election</COREF> .
-LRB- <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">General obligation bonds</COREF> are backed *-1 by <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> overall revenues and credit . -RRB-
Although many investors were aware that a bond offering was being scheduled *-1 , many expected a much smaller amount of bonds to be sold *-3 .
The fact that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> will issue such a large amount of debt was interpreted *-1 as a sign that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York 's</COREF> budgetary problems are more serious than *PRO* had been expected *-2 .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">New York</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the nation 's largest issuers of tax - exempt bonds</COREF> ,</COREF> sold $ 750 million *U* of municipal bonds just a few weeks ago .
There have been reports *ICH*-1 for months that <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> economy</COREF> is weakening , as <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the October 1987 stock market crash</COREF> continues *-2 to make <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> felt *-3 .
The recent sharp stock market decline exacerbated those concerns .
Meanwhile , tax revenues are falling while <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> spending needs are expanding .
Rumors persisted <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York 's</COREF> credit ratings -- single - A from Moody 's Investors Service Inc. and single - A - minus from Standard -AMP- Poor 's Corp. -- are at risk .
The weakness in <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> bonds follows a warning from <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> state Comptroller Edward Regan</COREF> that <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the 1987 crash</COREF> seriously weakened <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> economy</COREF> .
In a study , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the comptroller</COREF> said , `` <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">The city 's</COREF> glory days are over . ''
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Regan</COREF> warned mayoral candidates `` *PRO*-2 to be prepared for limited options and constraints on service increases 0 *T*-1 to address <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> problems in the next few years , due to the now - evident weakening in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> economy</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York City 's</COREF> revised financial plan , due out later this month , is expected *-1 to include measures 0 *T*-2 to balance <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> $ 27 billion *U* budget .
At present , analysts project a budget gap on the order of $ 500 million to $ 600 million *U* for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 1990 , although <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> own budget analysts project a narrower deficit .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mark Page</COREF> , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York 's</COREF> deputy director of finance</COREF> ,</COREF> said that investors ' concerns about <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> financial health</COREF> are `` unwarranted given <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> proven ability *PRO* to manage <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">ourselves</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> charges <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> critics with *PRO* spreading `` unfounded emotional rhetoric . ''
There are also questions about whether a new and inexperienced mayor can manage <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> through what *T*-1 could become a financial crisis .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The leading contender for the mayoral office</COREF> , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Democrat David Dinkins</COREF> ,</COREF> has been criticized *-1 recently for the way 0 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> handled <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> personal financial affairs *T*-2 .
And the controversy has led to uncertainty about <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the outcome of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF></COREF> .
Until <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Dinkins</COREF> was considered *-1 a shoo - in .
`` <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The market</COREF> can adjust to good news or bad news , but uncertainty drives people *PRO*-3 wild , '' said *T*-2 <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Bernard B. Beal</COREF> , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief executive of M.R. Beal -AMP- Co. , a securities firm that *T*-1 specializes in <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the municipal market</COREF></COREF> .
Until <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Everyone</COREF> felt certain 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> knew <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the outcome of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the election</COREF></COREF> .
Now , there have been a number of questions raised * . ''
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Last week</COREF> , yields on long - term <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> general obligation bonds jumped half a percentage point .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York City 's</COREF> 6 % bonds due 2018 , for example , were quoted *-1 late Friday at a price 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.80 % , compared with 7.60 % Thursday .
As the yield on <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> general obligation bonds</COREF> rose , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Bond Buyer 20 - bond general obligation index</COREF> , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the mostly widely followed gauge of the tax - exempt market</COREF> , held steady at 7.19 % in the week ended Oct. 19 .
