<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> is considering *PRO*-1 casting a line - item veto as a test 0 *T*-2 to determine whether the courts will rule that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">such authority</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> has long campaigned for passage of a bill or a constitutional amendment that *T*-2 would explicitly give <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a line - item veto , which *T*-1 would enable <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-3 to kill individual items in a big spending bill without *PRO* having *-4 to kill the entire bill .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has argued that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">such presidential power</COREF> is necessary *PRO* to rein in congressional spending .
But some analysts , particularly conservative legal scholars , have urged <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> *PRO*-1 not to wait for explicit authorization but *PRO* simply to assert that the Constitution already implicitly gives <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> the power *PRO* to exercise a line - item veto .
Such an assertion most likely would bring about a court challenge from Congress that *T*-1 would clarify whether a president already has <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">such power</COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater</COREF> , *PRO*-1 confirming comments made * this week by Vice President Dan Quayle , said 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> is `` interested '' in *PRO* finding a suitable test case .
But <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> also said that *PRO* exercising a test line - item veto is n't a `` top initiative '' on <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> agenda because <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> faces more - pressing budget issues at the moment .
