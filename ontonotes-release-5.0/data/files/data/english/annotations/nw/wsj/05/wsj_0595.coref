<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Wives</COREF> May Not Benefit When Men Do Chores *T*-1
WHEN <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">HUSBANDS</COREF> take on more housework *T*-1 , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> tend *-2 to substitute for chores done * by the kids rather than by <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the wife</COREF> .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Rand Corp. researchers Linda Waite and Frances Goldscheider</COREF> analyzed a large sample of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">married women with at least one child at home between the ages of six and 18</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">The women</COREF> indicated which family member *T*-1 usually did various household chores and the approximate share 0 each did *T*-2 .
Not unexpectedly , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">wives</COREF> , whether *PRO*-1 working or non-working , did by far the most -- about 80 % of the shopping , laundry and cooking , and about two - thirds of housecleaning , *PRO* washing dishes , child care and family paper work .
Only for yardwork and home maintenance did <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">women</COREF> do less than half .
But <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the researchers</COREF> found that while <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">children 's</COREF> household tasks eased <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the mother 's</COREF> burden appreciably , the husband 's helping hand `` appears *-1 to lighten <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the children 's</COREF> load almost on a one - for - one basis and to reduce <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the wife 's</COREF> responsibility only modestly . ''
This pattern was particularly evident among more highly educated couples .
In these families , husbands took on 80 % more chores than in couples with only grammar school education .
But the kids with highly educated parents did 68 % less housework than those in less - educated families .
`` It *EXP*-1 is clear , '' Ms. Waite says 0 *?* , `` that most of the effect of increasing education has been *PRO*-4 to shift who *T*-2 is helping <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the wife / mother</COREF> .
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> share decreases *NOT* , but only slightly . ''
Nursing Home Patients Apt *PRO*-1 to Be Private Payers
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">FAR FEWER elderly nursing home residents</COREF> *ICH*-2 bankrupt <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> than *PRO* was previously believed *-1 , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">two recent studies</COREF> declare 0 *T*-3 .
State governments place very low ceilings on how much property <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> may own *T*-1 *RNR*-3 or how much income <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may keep *T*-2 *RNR*-3 if <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want welfare help on medical bills .
Conventional wisdom has long held that <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">anywhere from one - fourth to one - half of all elderly long - term care patients</COREF> are obliged *-1 *PRO*-2 to spend <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> into poverty before *PRO*-1 qualifying for <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Medicaid</COREF> assistance .
But <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">separate reports from <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Joshua Weiner and Denise Spence of <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the Brookings Institution</COREF> and Korbin Liu of <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the Urban Institute</COREF></COREF></COREF> find that <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">`` <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a surprisingly small proportion</COREF> '' -- <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">only about 10 %</COREF> -- of residents</COREF> start out as private payers but `` spend down '' to <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Medicaid</COREF> levels</COREF> in a single nursing home stay before <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> die or are discharged *-1 .
-LRB- <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Another one - third</COREF> *ICH*-1 are already on <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Medicaid</COREF> when <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> enter the nursing homes *T*-2 , a considerably higher proportion than the analysts anticipated *?* . -RRB-
But <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a remarkably high percentage</COREF> -- <COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">over half</COREF> --</COREF> are private payers throughout <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> stay , even a fairly lengthy one .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">About one - third</COREF> pay out of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own pockets , while the rest are covered *-1 throughout by Medicare , private insurers or the Veterans Administration .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Both reports</COREF> are based *-1 on several thousand patients sampled * in a 1985 nationwide government survey .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Brookings</COREF> and <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Urban Institute</COREF> authors</COREF> caution , however , that most nursing home stays are of comparatively short duration , and *PRO* reaching <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Medicaid</COREF> level</COREF> is more likely with an unusually long stay or repeated stays .
Moreover , <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> note 0 *?* , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> who *T*-1 manage *PRO*-3 to pay <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own way</COREF> often do so only by *PRO* selling <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> homes , using up life savings or drawing heavily on children and other relatives .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> Era Young</COREF> Hold Liberal Views
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">THE <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">REAGAN</COREF> generation young men and women reaching political maturity during <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Ronald Reagan 's</COREF> presidency</COREF></COREF> -- are firmly liberal on race and gender , according to <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">NORC</COREF> , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the social science research center at the University of Chicago</COREF></COREF> .
Many political analysts have speculated that <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> years</COREF> would produce a staunchly conservative younger generation .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">NORC 's</COREF> most recent opinion surveys</COREF> <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">find</COREF> the youngest adults indeed somewhat more pro-Reagan and pro-Republican than other adults .
But , says 0 *T*-1 chief investigator Tom Smith , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> `` does not translate into support for conservatism in general or into conservative positions on feminist and civil rights issues . ''
Answers to a dozen questions in <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the 1986 , 1987 , 1988 and 1989 national surveys</COREF> reveal that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">men and women in the 18 to 24 age bracket</COREF> are considerably more liberal on race and gender than were *?* the 18 to 24 year olds in <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">NORC 's</COREF> polling in the early 1970s and early 1980s .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were also as liberal *RNR*-1 or more liberal *RNR*-1 than any other age group in the 1986 through 1989 surveys .
For example , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">66 % of the 18 to 24 year olds in the four latest surveys</COREF> favored an `` open housing '' law prohibiting homeowners from *PRO*-2 refusing on racial grounds *PRO*-1 to sell to prospective buyers .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> compares with 58 % of the similar age group in the 1980 through 1982 surveys and 55 % in the 1972 through 1975 surveys .
*PRO*-1 Asked *-3 whether <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> agreed or disagreed with the claim that men are emotionally better *ICH*-2 suited to politics than women , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">70 %</COREF> of <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> generation</COREF></COREF> disagreed , compared with under 60 % of younger men and women in the earlier years .
Odds and Ends
SEPARATED and divorced men and women are far more likely *PRO*-1 to be smokers than married persons , the Centers for Disease Control discovers 0 *T*-3 ... .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Graduate students</COREF> are taking longer than ever *PRO*-1 to get <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> doctor of philosophy degrees , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the National Research Council</COREF> says 0 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> estimates 0 the time between college graduation and the awarding of a Ph. D. has lengthened by 30 % over the past 20 years , with the average gap now ranging from about 7.4 years in the physical sciences to 16.2 years in education .
