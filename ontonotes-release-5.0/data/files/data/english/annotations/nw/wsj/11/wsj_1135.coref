<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">The Bush administration</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is submitting <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">a `` comprehensive '' proposal for *PRO* overhauling agricultural trade that *T*-1 could help break an impasse in <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the current round of multilateral trade negotiations</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The proposal</COREF> reiterates the U.S. desire *PRO* to scrap or reduce a host of trade - distorting subsidies on farm products .
But <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would allow considerable flexibility in *PRO* determining how and when these goals would be achieved *-1 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S. plan</COREF> also would ease the transition to freer agriculture trade by *PRO*-2 allowing some countries to convert non-tariff barriers into tariffs that , *PRO*-3 together with existing tariffs , *T*-1 then would be phased *-3 out over 10 years .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Trade Representative Carla Hills , who along with <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter</COREF> *T*-1 unveiled <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the proposal</COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is confident 0 <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will gain considerable support from <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. 's</COREF> trading partners .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Yeutter</COREF> , *PRO*-4 seeking *PRO*-5 to allay European objections to <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">an earlier U.S. plan that *T*-1 called for *PRO* eliminating all farm - trade barriers by the year 2000</COREF> , said 0 <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the new U.S. proposal</COREF> would n't `` put <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">farmers</COREF> out of business '' but would only encourage <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-6 to `` grow what the markets desire *T*-2 instead of what the government wants *T*-3 . ''
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> is submitting <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the proposal</COREF> today in Geneva , *PRO*-1 hoping that <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the initiative</COREF> will spur <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">members</COREF> of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-2 to reach agreement on new trade rules before <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> current negotiating round</COREF> concludes in December 1990 .
Another U.S. proposal filed * Monday urges more `` fair play '' in services trade , including predictable and clear rules and equality in the treatment of foreign and domestic service companies .
Unlike <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the earlier U.S. farm - trade proposal which *T*-1 struck European countries as too extreme</COREF> , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the latest plan</COREF> would provide some room for maneuver .
For instance , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the new U.S. package</COREF> makes clear 0 there would be a transition period during which <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">GATT</COREF> members</COREF> could use a combination of tariffs and quotas *PRO*-1 to cushion <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> farmers from foreign competition *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also says 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">countries</COREF> could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> experience an unusually heavy volume of imports .
Instead of *PRO*-1 proposing a complete elimination of farm subsidies , as <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the earlier U.S. proposal</COREF> did *?* , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the new package</COREF> calls for the elimination of only the most tradedistorting ones .
Less objectionable ones would be subject only to some restraints , and others with a `` relatively minor trade impact '' would be allowed *-1 to continue under certain conditions .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The new U.S. plan</COREF> also would establish procedures 0 *PRO* to prevent countries from *PRO* using health and sanitation rules *PRO*-1 to impede trade arbitrarily *T*-2 .
The goal would be *PRO* to resolve disputes such as one prompted * by <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the European Community 's current attempt *PRO* to bar imports of beef from hormone - treated U.S. cattle</COREF> .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> contends that <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> are n't justified on health grounds .
*PRO*-1 To encourage more competition among exporting countries , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> is proposing that export subsidies , including tax incentives for exporters , be phased *-2 out in five years .
