Comments by <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan</COREF> lent some support to <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> , but <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. unit</COREF> ended <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> lower against most major currencies .
Foreign - exchange dealers noted that the impact of <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the chairman 's</COREF> remarks</COREF> was slight and warned that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the currency</COREF> remains sensitive to developments on Wall Street .
Traders said that <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Greenspan , whose statements *T*-1 are ordinarily cautious ,</COREF> was especially careful *PRO*-2 to avoid any jarring proclamations , with fears about equities still unnerving financial markets .
*PRO*-1 Testifying before a panel of the House Banking Committee , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Greenspan</COREF> said 0 the short - term value of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> on foreign - exchange markets is n't the primary policy focus of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the central bank</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> essential focus is on domestic policy , '' <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Greenspan</COREF> said *T*-2 , *PRO*-1 referring to the goals of price stability and a stable economy .
In perhaps <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> most telling remark , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Greenspan</COREF> termed the current U.S. inflation rate of around 4.5 % as `` much too high 0 *T*-2 to be ignored *-1 . ''
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> added , however , that inflation could be brought *-1 down `` close to zero '' without *PRO* throwing <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> into a recession .
Analysts viewed <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the chairman 's</COREF> comments</COREF> as an indication that <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the central bank</COREF> is disinclined *PRO*-1 to ease monetary policy further in the near future .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">The dollar</COREF> climbed immediately higher on news of <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Greenspan 's</COREF> testimony</COREF> , *PRO*-1 settling lower in later trade as dealers squared positions ahead of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">today 's</COREF> preliminary report on third - quarter U.S. gross national product</COREF> .
In late <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> trading <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> was quoted *-1 at 1.8353 marks , down from 1.8355 marks Tuesday , and at 141.52 yen , up from 141.45 yen <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">late Tuesday</COREF> .
Sterling was quoted *-1 at $ 1.6145 *U* , up from $ 1.6055 *U* <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">late Tuesday</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Thursday</COREF> , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. currency</COREF> opened for trading at 141.60 yen , up from Wednesday 's <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> close of 141.55 yen .
Many traders forecast a continuation of the market 's recent bearish trend and predict 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. currency</COREF> will remain stuck in <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> relatively narrow ranges in the near term and then shift lower .
But according to <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Doug Madison</COREF> , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a corporate trader with Bank of America in Los Angeles</COREF></COREF> , a large number of short positions must first be corrected *-1 , *PRO* spurring a temporary upswing , before <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the unit</COREF> can turn lower .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> predicts a downward move in dollar - mark trade and a less dramatic slip in dollar - yen , *PRO*-2 noting that there continues *-3 to be a large pool of Japanese investor interest in U.S. securities , which *T*-1 could provide a solid base for <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> at around 140 yen .
Market participants hope 0 <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">today 's</COREF> GNP report</COREF> will offer more substantial evidence on <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. economic growth</COREF> , although analysts are quick *PRO*-1 to point out that <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the figures</COREF> may overstate <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the economy 's</COREF> vigor</COREF> .
`` The ` r ' word is looming again , '' says *T*-1 one dealer , *PRO*-2 referring to persistent concern among some market analysts that <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. economy</COREF> is heading toward a major slowdown if not a recession .
Some dealers note that while <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the third - quarter figures</COREF> may appear *-2 relatively bullish -- the market consensus calls for a 2.5 % annual growth rate , unchanged from the second - quarter rate -- it *EXP*-1 would take a significantly stronger figure *PRO* to alter market perceptions that <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> is softening .
Some analysts reckon that the next quarter 's figures will present a more accurate picture of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. economy</COREF> , *PRO*-1 showing a marked slowdown in a number of sectors , including housing starts and equities .
On the Commodity Exchange in <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> , gold for current delivery settled at $ 369.10 *U* an ounce , down $ 1.10 *U* .
Estimated volume was a light 1.7 million ounces .
In early trading in Hong Kong <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Thursday</COREF> , gold was quoted *-1 at $ 368.24 *U* an ounce .
