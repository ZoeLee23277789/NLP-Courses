FOR THOSE WHO *T*-1 DELIGHT in the misfortune of others , *PRO* read on .
This is a story about suckers .
Most of <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> know a sucker .
Many of <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> are suckers .
But what <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> may not know *T*-2 is just what *T*-1 makes somebody a sucker .
What *T*-1 makes <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> blurt out <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> credit - card numbers</COREF> to a caller 0 <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've never heard of *T*-2 ?
Do <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> really believe that <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the number</COREF> is just for verification and is simply a formality on the road to *PRO* being a grand - prize winner ?
What *T*-1 makes a person buy an oil well from some stranger knocking on the screen door ?
Or an interest in a retirement community in Nevada that *T*-2 will knock your socks off , once it is built *-1 ?
Because in the end , <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> always wind up *-1 asking <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">the same question : `` How could I be so stupid *T*-2</COREF> ? ''
There are , unfortunately , plenty of <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">answers to <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">that question</COREF></COREF> -- and <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">scam artists</COREF> know all of <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">These people</COREF> are very skilled at *PRO* finding out what *T*-1 makes <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">a person</COREF> tick , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="159" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Kent Neal</COREF> , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief of the economic - crime unit of the Broward County State Attorney 's Office in <COREF ID="161" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Fort Lauderdale , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Fla.</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="161" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a major haven for boiler rooms</COREF></COREF> .
`` Once <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> size <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> up , then <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know what buttons *PRO* to push *T*-1 . ''
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">John Blodgett</COREF> agrees -- and <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> ought *-1 to know .
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> used *-1 to be a boiler - room salesman , *PRO*-2 peddling investments in oil and gas wells and rare coins .
`` There 's a definite psychology of the sale and different personalities 0 you pitch *T*-1 different ways , '' <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
The most obvious pitch , of course , is the lure of big returns .
`` <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're all a little greedy .
<COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">Everyone</COREF> is vulnerable , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="162" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Charles Harper</COREF> , <COREF ID="162" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">associate regional administrator for <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">the Securities and Exchange Commission</COREF> in Miami</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">These guys</COREF> prey on human frailties . ''
While <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the promises of big profits</COREF> ought *-2 to set off warning bells , <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> often do n't *?* , in part because *PRO* get - rich - quick tales have become embedded *-1 in American folklore .
`` <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">The overnight success story</COREF> is part of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> culture , and <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> society puts an emphasis on <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with lotteries and Ed McMahon making millionaires out of people , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="164" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Michael Cunningham</COREF> , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an associate professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in Louisville</COREF></COREF> .
`` Other people are making it overnight , and the rest who *T*-1 toil daily do n't want *PRO*-2 to miss <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">that opportunity</COREF> when <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> seems *-3 to come along *T*-4 . ''
Adds *ICH*-4 <COREF ID="166" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Spencer Barasch</COREF> , <COREF ID="166" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">branch chief for enforcement at <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF> in Fort Worth , Texas</COREF> : `` Why do <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> play the lottery when the odds *ICH*-3 are great against <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-2 *T*-1 ?
People are shooting for a dream . ''
Clearly , though , scam artists have *-1 to be a bit more subtle than *PRO*-1 simply promising millions ; the psychology of suckers is n't simply the psychology of the greedy .
There 's also , for instance , the need *PRO* to be part of the in - crowd .
So one popular ploy is *PRO* to make a prospective investor feel like an insider , joining an exclusive group that *T*-1 is about *-2 to make a killing .
Between 1978 and 1987 , for instance , <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">SH Oil in Winter Haven , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Fla.</COREF> ,</COREF> sold interests in <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">oil wells</COREF> to a very select group of local residents , while *PRO*-1 turning away numerous other eager investors .
<COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="169" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The owner of <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="169" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Stephen Smith</COREF> , who *T*-1 has since pleaded guilty to state and federal fraud charges</COREF> , confided to investors that <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">a secret agreement with <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Amoco Oil Co.</COREF></COREF> and said 0 the location of <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wells</COREF> was confidential , according to <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">a civil suit filed * in a <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> state court by the <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> comptroller 's office</COREF> .
Neither <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Amoco</COREF> agreement</COREF> nor <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">the wells</COREF> existed , <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the suit</COREF> alleged 0 *T*-1 .
Such schemes , says 0 *?* <COREF ID="174" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tony Adamski</COREF> , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief of the financial - crimes unit of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Washington , D.C.</COREF> , appeal to <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">investors '</COREF> `` desire *PRO* to believe 0 <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is really true and that <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are part of a chosen group being given * <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">this opportunity</COREF> . ''
At times , salesmen may embellish the inside information with `` the notion that this is some slightly shady , slightly illegal investment 0 the person is being included *-1 in *T*-3 , '' says 0 *T*-2 <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Cunningham</COREF> .
In *PRO* <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">appealing</COREF> to those with a bit of larceny in their hearts , <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the fraud artist</COREF> can insist that a person keep an investment *PRO*-4 secret -- *PRO*-2 insulating <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> from *PRO*-3 being discovered *-1 and keeping <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> victim from *PRO* consulting with others .
<COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also adds to the mystery of the venture .
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="178" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Blodgett</COREF> , <COREF ID="178" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the boiler - room veteran</COREF> ,</COREF> believes that for many investors , the *PRO* get - rich - quick scams carry a longed - for element of excitement .
`` Once <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> got into <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was allowing <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to live a dream , '' <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> phoned <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> with updates on <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">the investment</COREF> , such as `` funny things that *T*-1 happened at the well that week , '' <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *T*-2 .
`` You gave <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> some excitement that <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't have *T*-1 in <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives . ''
-LRB- <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Blodgett , who *T*-2 was convicted *-1 in <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> state court of *PRO*-3 selling unregistered securities and in California state court of unlawful use *ICH*-6 of the telephone *PRO* to defraud and deceive</COREF> , is now on probation .
<COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has quit the business and is back in school , *PRO*-1 majoring in psychology with aspirations *PRO* to go into industrial psychology . -RRB-
For <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">some investors</COREF> , it 's the appearances that *T*-1 leave <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-2 deceived .
`` The trappings of success *ICH*-1 go a long way -- *PRO* wearing the right clothes , doing the right things , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Paul Andreassen</COREF> , <COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an associate professor of psychology at Harvard</COREF></COREF> .
Conservative appearances make people think 0 it 's a conservative investment .
`` <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> honestly lose money on risky investments that <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't realize 0 *T*-2 were a crapshoot , '' <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="181" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Paul Wenz</COREF> , <COREF ID="181" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Phoenix , Ariz. , attorney</COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 a promise of unrealistic returns would have made <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> leery .
But <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Wenz , who *T*-1 says 0 he lost $ 43,000 *U* in one precious - metals deal and $ 39,000 *U* in another ,</COREF> says 0 a salesman `` used a business - venture approach '' with <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , *PRO*-4 sending investment literature , a contract limiting <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">the firm 's</COREF> liability , and an insurance policy .
When <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> visited <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> office</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had `` all the trappings of legitimacy . ''
Still others are stung *-1 by a desire *PRO* to do both well and good , says 0 *T*-2 <COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Douglas Watson</COREF> , <COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department 's bunko - forgery division</COREF> .
Born - again Christians are the most visible targets of <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">unscrupulous do - gooder investment pitches</COREF> .
But hardly the only ones : <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">The scams</COREF> promise -- among other things -- *PRO*-1 to help *PRO* save the environment , feed starving families and prevent the disappearance of children .
Psychologists say 0 isolated people who *T*-1 do n't discuss their investments with others are particularly at risk for fraud .
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Scam artists</COREF> seek out such people -- or try *PRO*-1 to make sure that <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> victims</COREF> isolate <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
For instance , salesmen may counter <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">a man 's</COREF> objection that <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wants *PRO*-2 to discuss an investment with <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife by *PRO*-3 asking , `` Who *T*-1 wears the pants in <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> family ? ''
Or <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">an investor who *T*-2 wants his accountant 's advice</COREF> may be told *-1 , `` <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> seem like a guy who *T*-3 can make up his own mind . ''
Often <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">con artists</COREF> will try *PRO*-1 to disarm <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> victims by *PRO*-2 emphasizing similarities between them .
<COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="189" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">William Lynes</COREF> , <COREF ID="189" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a retired engineer from <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Lockheed Corp.</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and <COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife</COREF> , <COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lily</COREF> ,</COREF> warmed to the investment pitches of <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">a penny - stock peddler from <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">Stuart - James Co. in <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">Atlanta</COREF></COREF></COREF> after <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the broker</COREF> told <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> , too , had once worked with <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Lockheed</COREF> .
<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">The Lyneses , of Powder Springs , <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">Ga.</COREF> ,</COREF> have filed suit in <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">Georgia</COREF> state court against <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">Stuart James</COREF> , *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">alleging</COREF> fraud .
<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are awaiting an arbitration proceeding .
<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the broker</COREF> took <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> out for lunch frequently .
<COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> urged <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-2 to refer <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> friends , who *T*-1 also lost money .

`` It *EXP*-1 's not uncommon for <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">these guys</COREF> to send pictures of <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> or <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> families *PRO*-3 to ingratiate <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> clients , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="200" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Terree Bowers</COREF> , <COREF ID="200" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief of <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">the major - frauds section of the U.S. attorney 's office in <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">Los Angeles</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've seen cases where <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">salesmen</COREF> will affect the accent of the region of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are calling *T*-1 *T*-2 .
Anything *PRO* to make a sale . ''
Experts say that whatever a person 's particular weak point *T*-1 , timing is crucial .
<COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> may be particularly vulnerable to flim - flam pitches when <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are in the midst of a major upheaval in <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives *T*-1 .
`` Sometimes when <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> are making big changes , retiring from <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> jobs , moving to a new area *T*-2 , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> lose <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bearings , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Maury Elvekrog</COREF> , <COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a licensed psychologist who *T*-1 is now an investment adviser and principal in <COREF ID="203" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Seger - Elvekrog Inc.</COREF> , <COREF ID="203" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Birmingham , Mich. , investment - counseling firm</COREF></COREF> .

<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are obviously also more susceptible when <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need money *T*-1 - retirees , for instance , trying *PRO* to bolster their fixed income or parents fretting over how *PRO* to pay for a child 's college expenses *T*-2 .
`` <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">These people</COREF> are n't necessarily stupid or naive .
