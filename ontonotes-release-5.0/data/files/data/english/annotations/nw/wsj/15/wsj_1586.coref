When <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Seventh Avenue</COREF> fur business here</COREF> was flying high 20 years ago *T*-1 , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Jack Purnick</COREF> had 25 workers and a large factory .
Now <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> half - dozen employees work in an eighth - floor shop that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *T*-1 is smaller than <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> old storage room .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also says 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is losing money now .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> blames imports .
But just down <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Seventh Avenue , where about 75 % of U.S. fur garments are made *-1 *T*-2</COREF> , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Larry Rosen</COREF> has acquired two retail outlets , broadened <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fur - making line and expanded into leather .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> credits imports .
The difference lies in how <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the two entrepreneurial furriers</COREF> reacted to the foreign competition and <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">transformation of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> industry</COREF> over the past 10 years</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">One</COREF> stuck to old - line business traditions , while <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the other</COREF> embraced <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the change</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">The small , good fur salon</COREF> is not what <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> used *-2 to be *T*-1 , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="82" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Purnick</COREF> , <COREF ID="82" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">75 years</COREF> old</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> make the finest product in the world , and the Americans are being kicked around *-1 . ''
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Rosen</COREF> , though , believes 0 imports have reinvigorated <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the industry in which <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has worked for most of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> 57 years *T*-1</COREF> .
`` You 've got some minds here that *T*-1 wo n't think progressively , '' <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
Import competition for U.S. furs has risen sharply since furriers started *-1 aggressively marketing `` working - girl mink '' and similar lower - priced imported furs in recent years .
Merchants discovered <COREF ID="94" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a consumer largely ignored * by higher - priced furriers</COREF> : <COREF ID="94" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the younger woman -- even in her late 20s -- who *T*-1 never thought 0 she could buy a mink</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">The new market</COREF> helped boost U.S. fur sales to <COREF ID="84" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">about $ 1.8 billion *U* a year now</COREF> , <COREF ID="84" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">triple the level in the late 1970s</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also opened the door to furs made * in South Korea , China , Hong Kong and other countries .
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jindo Furs</COREF> , <COREF ID="85" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a large South Korean maker</COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> operates 35 retail outlets in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and plans *PRO*-1 to open 15 more by the end of next year .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Purnick</COREF> and other old - line furriers call <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">many of the the imports</COREF> *PRO*-1 unstylish and poorly made .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">High - end U.S. furriers</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">these imports</COREF> have n't squeezed <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">low - priced and middle - priced furriers like <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Purnick , who *T*-1 once saturated the five - block <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Seventh Avenue</COREF> fur district ,</COREF></COREF> say 0 imports have cut <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sales .
A woman who *T*-1 once would have saved for two or three seasons *PRO*-2 to buy a U.S. - made mink can now get an imported mink right away for less than $ 2,000 *U* .
Yet <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Rosen</COREF> has turned the import phenomenon to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> advantage .
Early in the decade <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">fur workers in many foreign countries</COREF> were willing *PRO*-1 to work longer hours at lower wages than <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> American counterparts and were more open to innovation .
In 1982 , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> started a factory in Greece .
Two years later , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> opened one in West Germany .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also noticed that foreign makers were introducing many variations on the traditional fur , and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> decided *PRO*-1 to follow suit .
By *PRO*-1 combining <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> strengths in innovation and quality control with the lower costs of production abroad , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has been able *PRO*-2 to produce high - quality goods at low cost .
*PRO* To maintain control over production and avoid overdependence on foreign sources , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still makes most of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> furs in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> .
But six years ago <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> also began *-1 importing from <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the Far East</COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Inspired *-2 by imports , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Rosen</COREF> now makes fur muffs , hats and flings .
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">This year</COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> produced a men 's line and offers dyed furs in red , cherry red , violet , royal blue and forest green .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has leather jackets from Turkey that *T*-1 are lined *-2 with eel skin and topped *-2 off with raccoon - skin collars .
From Asia , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has mink jackets with floral patterns made * by *PRO* using different colored furs .
Next <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will be testing <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">pictured embroidery -LRB- called * *PRO*-1 kalega -RRB- made * in <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the Far East</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> plans *PRO*-1 to attach <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the embroidery</COREF> to the backs of mink coats and jackets .
Besides *PRO*-2 adding to sales , leathers also attract retailers who *T*-1 may buy furs later , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> adds 0 *T*-3 .
Other furriers have also benefited from leathers .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Seymour Schreibman</COREF> , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the 65 - year - old owner of Schreibman Raphael Furs Inc.</COREF> ,</COREF> treats the reverse side of a Persian lambskin *PRO*-1 to produce a reversible fur - and - leather garment .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 it accounts for 25 % of total sales .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Rosen</COREF> is also pushing retail sales .
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">This year</COREF> <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> bought <COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">two stores</COREF> , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one in Brooklyn and one in Queens</COREF> .
Other furriers have also placed more weight on retailing .
Golden Feldman Furs Inc. began *-1 retailing aggressively eight years ago , and now retail sales account for about 20 % of gross income .
In other moves , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Rosen</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> bought a truck three years ago *PRO*-1 to reach more retailers .
Since then <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has expanded <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fleet and can now bring <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> furs to the front door of retailers as far away as the Midwest .
Small retailers who *T*-1 ca n't afford *PRO*-2 to travel to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> showroom have become fair game .
Such moves have helped <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Rosen</COREF> *PRO*-1 weather the industry slump of recent years .
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">The industry</COREF> enjoyed six prosperous years beginning in 1980 , but since 1986 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">sales</COREF> have languished at <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> $ 1.8 billion *U* peak .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Large furriers such as Antonovich Inc. , Fur Vault Inc. and Evans Inc.</COREF> all reported losses in <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> latest fiscal years .
Aftereffects of the 1987 stock market crash head the list of reasons .
In addition , competition has glutted the market with both skins and coats , *PRO* driving prices down .
The animal - rights movement has n't helped sales .
Warm winters over the past two years have trimmed demand , too , furriers complain 0 *T*-1 .
And those who *T*-1 did n't move some production overseas suffer labor shortages .
`` <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">The intensive labor needed * *PRO* to manufacture furs -LCB- in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. .</COREF> -RCB-</COREF> is not as available as <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was *?* , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Schreibman , who *T*-1 is starting overseas production</COREF> .
But even those who *T*-1 have found a way 0 *PRO* to cope with the imports and the slump *T*-2 , fear that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">furs</COREF> are losing part of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> allure .
`` People are promoting furs in various ways and taking the glamour out of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the fur business</COREF> , '' says <COREF ID="91" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Stephen Sanders</COREF> , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">divisional merchandise manager for Marshall Field 's department store in Chicago</COREF> .
`` You ca n't make a commodity out of a luxury , '' insists *T*-1 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Purnick</COREF> , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> furrier</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> contends that *PRO* chasing consumers with low - priced imports will harm <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> in the long run by *PRO*-1 reducing the prestige of furs .
But <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Rosen</COREF> responds : `` Whatever people want *PRO*-1 to buy *T*-2 , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll sell *T*-3 .
The name of the game is *PRO* to move goods .
