*PRO* Call <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Jim Wright 's</COREF> office in downtown Fort Worth , Texas ,</COREF> these days and the receptionist still answers the phone , `` <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Speaker Wright 's</COREF> office</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">The former congressman , who *T*-2 resigned as <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">speaker of <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF></COREF> after an investigation of <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> financial dealings ,</COREF> is ensconced *-1 in <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> district office , maintained * by taxpayers on a $ 200,000 *U* allowance</COREF> .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is negotiating a rich book contract to boot .
One of the hottest tickets on <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">Washington 's</COREF> social calendar this fall was a charity benefit honoring <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">former Congressman Tony Coelho , who *T*-1 landed a million - dollar job on <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street</COREF> after *PRO*-2 resigning over a controversial junk - bond investment last summer</COREF> .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="163" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Michael Deaver</COREF> , <COREF ID="163" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the former <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">White House</COREF> aide</COREF> ,</COREF> has become the most recent addition to the teeming ranks of fallen politicians and officials earning their way as lobbyists and consultants here .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Deaver</COREF> has reopened a public - relations business .
*PRO* Surviving scandal has become a rite of political passage at a time when a glut of scandal has blunted <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">this town 's</COREF> sensibility *T*-1 .
*PRO* Let the president demand strict new ethics rules : With four sitting <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> members accused * of sexual misdeeds , amid <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the unfolding <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">HUD</COREF> scandal</COREF> and after the <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Wright</COREF> debacle , `` people are slightly dulled *-2 by scandal , '' says 0 *T*-1 <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">political humorist Art Buchwald</COREF> .
`` It now takes something really weird *PRO* to inspire public outrage . ''
Not all the scandal - tripped have enjoyed soft landings .
But many have *?* .
`` These people bounce back more resiliently than regular people , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> writer Suzanne Garment , who *T*-1 is working on a history of <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">post-Watergate</COREF> scandal .
*PRO* Given <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own penchant for book writing , it *EXP*-1 is surprising that none of <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the masters</COREF> of <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">scandal survival</COREF></COREF> have yet published a guide to <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">the art</COREF> .
For there is an emerging protocol -- indeed , an etiquette -- to <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Among the rules :
*PRO* Pretend 0 Nothing Happened
As if <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> were still in <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> old job</COREF> , <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Wright</COREF> , by *PRO*-2 resigning with <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> title instead of being forced *-1 from <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> job</COREF> , by law enjoys a $ 120,000 *U* annual office expense allowance , three paid staffers , up to $ 67,000 *U* for stationery and telephones and continued use of the franking privilege .
*PRO* Not to mention a generous federal pension .
There is also a busy schedule of speaking engagements at $ 10,000 *U* a pop , at tony places including the Yale Political Union .
`` <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's as busy as <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was *?* as speaker , '' reports *T*-1 <COREF ID="166" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Wright 's</COREF> administrative aide</COREF> , <COREF ID="166" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Larry Shannon</COREF> .
*PRO* Atone
On the edge of fashionable Georgetown , in a chic office with a river view and a number of corporate clients whom <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wo n't name *T*-1 , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Deaver</COREF> is trying *PRO*-2 to reclaim <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> reputation as one of the savviest image makers in <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">town</COREF> .
There are few mementos of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> days as <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">White House</COREF> deputy chief of staff and confidant of Ronald and Nancy Reagan .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">The former $ 3 million - *U* a - year lobbyist</COREF> now frequents shelters for the homeless and devotes a third of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> time *PRO*-1 counseling other recovering alcoholics .
`` <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> feel better than <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ever have *?* in my life , '' <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Deaver</COREF> confessed to <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> alcoholism during <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> trial on perjury charges</COREF> .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is also a recovering workaholic , *PRO*-2 relaxing with <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> family and <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">creating</COREF> topiary , or garden - shrub sculpture , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">a fashionable pursuit for which <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> developed a passion *T*-1 during <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> three - year legal ordeal</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="168" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">One sign of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Deaver 's</COREF> renaissance</COREF> : <COREF ID="168" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an appearance on ABC 's `` Nightline '' for a show on pack journalism</COREF> .
Host Ted Koppel introduced <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> as `` the media master of the Reagan Administration , '' with nary a mention of <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Deaver 's</COREF> conviction in 1987 on perjury charges .
*PRO* Finding <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF>
`` When <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">someone</COREF> says , ` <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've turned to <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> *T*-1 , ' everybody lays off , '' observes *T*-2 <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Frank Mankiewicz</COREF> , <COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an old <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> hand and former aide to Robert Kennedy</COREF></COREF> .
Thus have Charles Colson and Jeb Magruder launched successful <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">post-Watergate</COREF> careers at the pulpit .
But it does n't always work so smoothly .
After allegations *ICH*-1 surfaced in a <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">1985</COREF> divorce contest that <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had beaten <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife</COREF> , <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">SEC enforcement chief John Fedders</COREF> retreated to <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">a Trappist monastery in rural Virginia</COREF> .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is now in solo law practice in <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> , but <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fees have been meager and <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> failed in efforts *PRO* to win a chunk of <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> ex-wife 's</COREF> royalties on <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> *PRO* tell - all book .
From time to time <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> returns to <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the monastery</COREF> for prayer , meditation and pro bono legal work .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Fedders</COREF> is philosophical about <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> travails .
`` This whole experience has been an opportunity for internal growth , '' <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> sees a psychoanalyst five mornings a week .
`` <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've surrendered to the circumstances , '' <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Fedders</COREF> says *T*-1 .
`` The word surrender has a precise psychoanalytic meaning .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> universe has changed .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm enjoying <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> life and who <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am *T*-1 today .
The aspect of *PRO* being a mega-lawyer is n't as important . ''
*PRO* Do n't Linger
`` The best thing 0 you can do *T*-1 is get off the screen , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Buchwald</COREF> .
Nobody proved that more masterfully than <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="175" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Coelho</COREF> , <COREF ID="175" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the former Democratic majority whip</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Declaring that there was life after <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> , <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> resigned almost immediately after media reports questioned the propriety of a <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">1986</COREF> junk - bond investment , before any official investigations took hold .
Among the glitterati who *T*-1 turned out in bipartisan black - tie force *PRO*-3 to benefit the Coelho Epilepsy Fund last month were *T*-2 Sen. Robert Dole , Rep. Newt Gingrich , and other kingpins of <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> .
Dan Rather served as emcee .
From <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> new , million - dollar - a - year perch on <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street</COREF> as a managing director of Wertheim Schroder -AMP- Co. , <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Coelho</COREF> reports that <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">many of <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> former colleagues</COREF> have contacted <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 to find out how <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> , too , can pursue investment banking careers *T*-1 .
It *EXP*-1 Helps *PRO* to Be Male
Male scandal victims invariably fare better .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="177" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Anne Burford</COREF> , <COREF ID="177" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the former <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">EPA</COREF> chief who *T*-2 resigned under fire in <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">1983</COREF> during <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">a flap with <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF></COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> was kayoed *-1 in <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the confrontation</COREF> , even though <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was never charged *-3 with official wrondgoing .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> worked part - time as a consultant and wrote a book , but never restarted her high - powered legal career .
It did n't help when , in <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">1986</COREF> , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was charged *-2 *RNR*-3 -LRB- and then cleared *-2 *RNR*-3 -RRB- on allegations of public drunkenness *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> cut <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> losses and ran , '' <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says *T*-1 , from <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> new home in Colorado , where <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is busy *PRO*-3 remodeling *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Burford</COREF> remains bitter over the overwhelming legal expenses involved * in *PRO* clearing <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> name .
`` <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> husband was instantly impoverished *-2 by the very act of *PRO* marrying <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Another former <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">EPA</COREF> official</COREF> , <COREF ID="178" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rita Lavelle</COREF> , is still struggling after <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> conviction in <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">1983</COREF> on perjury charges .
`` There 's nothing 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> could do *T*-1 *PRO*-3 to bring <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">herself</COREF> back to where <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was *T*-2 , '' says *T*-4 <COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> lawyer</COREF> , <COREF ID="180" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">James Bierbower</COREF> .
`` You could say 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> survived , but it was n't easy on <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> . ''
No book contracts have been dangled *-1 before <COREF ID="181" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Deborah Gore Dean</COREF> , <COREF ID="181" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the reigning queen of <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">HUD</COREF> scandal</COREF></COREF> .

<COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was back in jail over the summer on shoplifting charges .
*PRO* Be the Star
Central figures -- such as <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Richard Nixon</COREF> -- usually fare better than those with supporting roles .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="185" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Richard Secord</COREF> , <COREF ID="185" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the retired Air Force general felled * in <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">the Iran - Contra scandal</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> is all but ruined -- *PRO*-1 forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to sell <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> Virginia home and pull <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> kids out of college , according to a recent fund - raising appeal sent * out on <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> behalf .
Yet <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> co-defendant in the case -- also <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">a former military officer by the name of Oliver North</COREF> --</COREF> has been busily and profitably burnishing his involvement in <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">the affair</COREF> .
What *T*-1 accounts for the difference ?
During the televised <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">Iran - Contra</COREF> hearings , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. North</COREF> came off as a patriot from central casting .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Secord 's</COREF> performance was decidedly less inspiring .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. North</COREF> remains in heavy demand as a speaker , for fees reported * in the $ 20,000 *U* range .
Even in the wake of Hurricane Hugo 750 people turned out in a remote Virginia town in September for a `` family tribute '' to <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. North</COREF> given * by two dozen conservative members of <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> .
If Sex Is Involved , All Bets Are Off
Sex scandals make people look careless and silly , and one of the worst sins in <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> is *PRO* to be laughed at *-1 .
`` You can be wicked , but not foolish , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mankiewicz</COREF> .
Nevertheless , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Rep. Gerry Studds of Massachusetts</COREF> was handily re-elected *-2 because of the candor with which <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> handled revelations that <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had sex with a male congressional page in <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">1983</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Former Rep.

<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="189" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Bauman</COREF> , <COREF ID="189" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a conservative</COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was deserted *-1 by the right wing .
`` <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Conservatives</COREF> shoot <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own , '' <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
If the political establishment is reluctant *PRO*-1 to forgive sexual misadventures , the private sector sometimes will *?* .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">John Tower</COREF> was accused *-1 of womanizing and boozing during <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> unsuccessful bid *PRO* to win confirmation as secretary of defense earlier this year .
Now <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is writing a book , serving on an elite foreign policy advisory board and consulting for an array of corporate clients , including British publishing mogul Robert Maxwell .
*PRO* Become a Lobbyist
When all else fails *T*-1 , <COREF ID="190" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Gucci Gulch</COREF> -- <COREF ID="190" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the fabled halls of the Capitol inhabited * by lobbyists and their imported shoes</COREF> -- offers a welcome environment for fallen officials .
Former Rep. Fernand St Germain , brought * down by the savings - and - loan crisis , now represents -- you guessed it -- savings - and - loans associations .
Some become pseudo-lobbyists .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">John Mack</COREF> promptly quit <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> job *ICH*-2 last spring as an aide to <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Speaker Wright</COREF> amid public outrage over <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mack 's</COREF> violent attack on a young woman when <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was 19 years old *T*-1 .
After a few weeks in seclusion , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mack</COREF> opened a consulting firm , but not *PRO* to enable <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-3 to directly lobby ; that would require <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 to disclose <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> clients by *PRO* registering as a lobbyist .
Still , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mack</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> talks to `` 30 members of <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> a week . ''
Misery Loves Company
Other scandal survivors are sometimes the best source of solace .

One of the first people 0 *T*-2 to come to the <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Deaver</COREF> home after <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> troubles erupted was <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">former <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Nixon</COREF> aide John Ehrlichman , whom <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Deaver</COREF> scarcely knew *T*-1</COREF> .
