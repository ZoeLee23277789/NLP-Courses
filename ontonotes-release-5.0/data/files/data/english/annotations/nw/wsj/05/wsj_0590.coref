There may be a truce in the long war of nerves between <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> and <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> over how <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">this country</COREF> conducts secret intelligence operations abroad *T*-1 .
After years of mistrust born * of Watergate , past misdeeds of <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the Central Intelligence Agency</COREF> , and the <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Iran - Contra</COREF> scandal , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> and <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate Intelligence Committee</COREF></COREF> appear *-1 ready *ICH*-3 -- for now , at least -- *PRO*-4 to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">trust</COREF> <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">each other</COREF> when it comes to *PRO* setting policy on covert activities *T*-2 .
If <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">that attitude</COREF> lasts , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could infuse covert action planning with a level of care and confidence that *T*-2 has n't been seen *-1 in years .
Over the past week , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> has agreed *PRO*-1 to keep <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> informed *-2 , usually in advance , of covert actions and to put key intelligence decisions in writing .
That was n't always the way 0 the <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration handled such matters *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> has pledged as well *PRO*-1 to respect <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the 14 - year - old executive order barring U.S. agents from *PRO*-2 assassinating foreign leaders or helping others *PRO*-3 to do so</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> never fully trusted <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">former <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">CIA</COREF> chief William Casey</COREF> and National Security Adviser John Poindexter *PRO*-1 to honor <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the ban</COREF> .
Despite objections by <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> also has agreed to the establishment of an inspector general at <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> who *T*-1 would be independent of the <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">CIA</COREF> director .
In return , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate panel</COREF> has dropped efforts *PRO* to enact legislation requiring <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> *PRO*-1 to inform <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> within 48 hours of the launching of any covert activity .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also has removed a ban on <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">CIA</COREF> use of a contingency fund for covert acts and has agreed *PRO*-1 to wipe away some tortured and legalistic restrictions on coup planning put * in place *PRO*-2 to ensure that <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> did n't get back in the assassination game .
`` <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've finally been able *PRO*-2 to convince <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> that <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Casey</COREF> and -LCB- Oliver -RCB- North do n't work here anymore , '' says *T*-1 one administration official .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">The new understanding</COREF> did n't just spring to life in a spontaneous eruption of sweetness and light .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> emerged after a rancorous display of old - style intelligence politics that *T*-1 followed this month 's failed coup attempt in Panama .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">The White House</COREF> used television appearances and leaks *PRO*-1 to argue that congressionally imposed restrictions on covert actions made U.S. support for such coups difficult .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> even disclosed privately that one <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan - era</COREF> deal with <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> required <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 to notify <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the odious Panamanian dictator</COREF> , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Manuel Noriega</COREF> ,</COREF> if <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> learned of a coup plot that *T*-1 might endanger <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">The president</COREF> also hinted 0 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might veto <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">this year 's intelligence authorization bill</COREF> if <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is too restrictive .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Intelligence Committee</COREF> Chairman David Boren -LRB- D. , Okla . -RRB-</COREF> and <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Vice Chairman William Cohen -LRB- R. , Maine -RRB-</COREF></COREF> , for <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> part , angrily accused <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> of *PRO*-3 selectively leaking classified documents and trying unfairly *PRO*-2 to shift the blame *ICH*-1 to <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> for the bungled attempt *PRO* to topple <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Gen. Noriega</COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">The White House</COREF> got the better of the exchange but took care *PRO*-2 not to press <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> advantage to the kind of constitutional confrontation sought * by conservative Republicans who *T*-1 do n't want any congressional oversight of intelligence activities .
Instead , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> and <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> aides</COREF> made it clear 0 <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> respected <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Congress 's</COREF> role and felt 0 <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could work with <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the conservative Mr. Boren</COREF> and <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the moderate Mr. Cohen</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-1 to iron out their differences .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">The senators</COREF> responded in kind .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Boren</COREF> happily told reporters that there had been `` a meeting of the minds '' with <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> , and that <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> had given <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> `` a clean slate , '' free of the impediments imposed * during the <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> years .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Cohen</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the relationship</COREF> has reverted to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">pre-Reagan</COREF> character .
There still are some details 0 *T*-1 to be nailed *-2 down .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> is reserving the right *ICH*-3 in `` rare '' instances *PRO* to keep <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> in the dark , *PRO*-2 asserting a constitutional prerogative 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> does n't recognize *T*-1 .
And a pending Justice Department interpretation of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the assassination ban</COREF> could raise questions that *T*-2 would have *-3 to be settled *-1 .
Moreover , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">both sides</COREF> may face political critics .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Some conservatives</COREF> will accuse <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> of *PRO*-1 promising <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> too much .
And <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> continue *-1 anonymously attacking <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">CIA</COREF> Director William Webster for *PRO*-2 being too accommodating to <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> .
At the same time , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">some congressional liberals</COREF> will accuse <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Sens. Boren and Cohen</COREF> of *PRO*-1 wimping out , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will warn that <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the lawmakers '</COREF> concessions raise the specter of more internationally embarrassing covert operations like the mining of Nicaraguan harbors and the <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF> arms sales .
But if the cooperative attitude holds and there is greater consultation on covert activities , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> could be entering an era when <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">such hare - brained schemes</COREF> are scrapped *-1 before <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get off the drawing boards , while risky but well - planned secret operations can be undertaken *-2 without fear that <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">a panicky Congress</COREF> will balk *T*-3 .
