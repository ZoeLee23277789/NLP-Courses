    barriers by the year 2000, said the new U.S. proposal would n't `` put farmers out of business '' but would only
    encourage them to `` grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants. ''

    Mr. Yeutter , *PRO*-4 seeking *PRO*-5 to allay European objections to an earlier U.S. plan that *T*-1 called for *PRO*
    eliminating all farm - trade barriers by the year 2000 , said 0 the new U.S. proposal would n't `` put farmers out of
    business '' but would only encourage them *PRO*-6 to `` grow what the markets desire *T*-2 instead of what the
    government wants *T*-3 . ''
