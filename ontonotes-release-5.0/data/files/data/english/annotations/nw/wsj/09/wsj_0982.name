Investors poured <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 billion</ENAMEX> more into money - market mutual funds in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest week</ENAMEX> despite further declines in yields .
Assets of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> taxable funds tracked by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBC / Donoghue 's Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> jumped to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 351.2 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week ended Tuesday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Holliston</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> - based newsletter said .
Assets soared <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous week</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , the average yield on taxable funds dropped nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">a tenth of a percentage point</ENAMEX> , the largest drop since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">midsummer</ENAMEX> .
The average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - day</ENAMEX> compound yield , which assumes that dividends are reinvested and that current rates continue for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year</ENAMEX> , fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.47 %</ENAMEX> , its lowest since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late last year</ENAMEX> , from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.55 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</ENAMEX> before , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donoghue 's</ENAMEX> .
`` Lower yields are just reflecting lower short - term interest rates , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Malizia Negus</ENAMEX> , editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> .
Money funds invest in such things as short - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities , commercial paper and certificates of deposit , all of which have been posting lower interest rates since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</ENAMEX> .
Individual investors can still get better yields on money funds than on many other short - term instruments .
The yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills sold at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> 's auction , for example , was just <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.77 %</ENAMEX> .
The average yield on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six - month</ENAMEX> CDs of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50,000</ENAMEX> or less at major banks was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.96 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the week ended Tuesday</ENAMEX> , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banxquote Money Markets</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> information service .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> way that money fund managers boost yields in a declining rate environment is by extending the maturities of their investments , so they can earn the current higher rates for a longer period .
The average maturity of the taxable funds that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donoghue 's</ENAMEX> follows increased by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two days</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest week</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 days</ENAMEX> , its longest since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> .
`` They 're anticipating further declines in rates and they 're going to get them , slowly , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter Frank</ENAMEX> , chief economist for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Donoghue Organization</ENAMEX> , publisher of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Money Fund Report</ENAMEX> .
Average maturity was as short as <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">29 days</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the start of this year</ENAMEX> , when short - term interest rates were moving steadily upward .
The average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - day</ENAMEX> compound yield of the funds reached <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.62 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late April</ENAMEX> .
The highest - yielding funds are still above <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> .
The top - performing fund in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the latest week</ENAMEX> was Dreyfus Worldwide Dollar , with a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - day</ENAMEX> compound yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.45 %</ENAMEX> .
The fund invests heavily in dollar - denominated money - market securities overseas .
It is currently waiving management fees , which contributes to the higher yield .
The average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">seven - day</ENAMEX> simple yield of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">400</ENAMEX> funds fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.14 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.21 %</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donoghue 's</ENAMEX> reported .
The average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - day</ENAMEX> simple yield slid to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.22 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.26 %</ENAMEX> , and the average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - day</ENAMEX> compound yield fell to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.56 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.60 %</ENAMEX> .
