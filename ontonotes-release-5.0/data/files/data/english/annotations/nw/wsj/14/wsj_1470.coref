<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">The class - action suit</COREF> highlights shortcomings of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Trans-Alaska Pipeline Liability Fund , which *T*-1 gets <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> money from oil companies using the pipeline and compensates those harmed by oil spills</COREF> .
On July 2 , 1987 , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the tanker S.S. Glacier Bay</COREF> struck <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">a rock</COREF> and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">spilled</COREF> almost 150,000 gallons of oil into the Cook Inlet .
