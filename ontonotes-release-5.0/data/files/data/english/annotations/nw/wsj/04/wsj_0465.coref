Medical scientists are starting *-2 to uncover a handful of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">genes which *T*-3 , if *PRO*-4 damaged *-5 , unleash the chaotic growth of cells that *T*-1 characterizes cancer</COREF> .
Scientists say 0 the discovery of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">these genes</COREF> in recent months is painting a new and startling picture of how cancer develops *T*-1 .
An emerging understanding of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the genes</COREF> is expected *-1 to produce an array of new strategies for future cancer treatment and prevention .
That is for the future .
Already , scientists are developing tests based * on <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the newly identified genes</COREF> that *T*-1 , for the first time , can predict whether an otherwise healthy individual is likely *-2 to get cancer .
`` It 's <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">a super-exciting set of discoveries</COREF> , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="199" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Bert Vogelstein</COREF> , <COREF ID="199" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Johns Hopkins University researcher who *T*-1 has just found <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">a gene pivotal to the triggering of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">colon cancer</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` Only a decade ago cancer was a black box about which we knew nothing *T*-1 at the molecular level .
Today , we know that the accumulation of several of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">these altered genes</COREF> can initiate <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">a cancer</COREF> and , then , propel <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> into a deadly state . ''
Scientists call the new class of genes *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">tumor - suppressors</COREF> , or simply anti-cancer genes</COREF> .
When *PRO*-3 functioning normally *T*-2 , <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> make <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">proteins that *T*-1 hold a cell 's growth in check</COREF> .
But if <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the genes</COREF> are damaged *-1 -- perhaps by radiation , a chemical or through a chance accident in cell division -- <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> growth - suppressing proteins</COREF> no longer work , and cells normally under control turn malignant .
<COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">The newly identified genes</COREF> differ from <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">a family of genes discovered * in the early 1980s called * *PRO*-1 oncogenes</COREF> .
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">Oncogenes</COREF> must be present for a cell to become malignant , but researchers have found <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in normal *RNR*-1 as well as in cancerous *RNR*-1 cells , *PRO* suggesting that <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">oncogenes</COREF> do n't cause cancer by <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
In recent months , researchers have come *PRO*-2 to believe 0 the two types of cancer genes work in concert : An oncogene may turn proliferating cells *PRO*-3 malignant only after <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the tumor - suppressor gene</COREF> has been damaged *-1 .
Like all genes , <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">tumor - suppressor genes</COREF> are inherited *-1 in <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="233" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">two copies</COREF> , <COREF ID="233" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">one from each parent</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">Either copy</COREF> can make <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">the proteins needed * *PRO* to control cell growth</COREF> , so for cancer to arise , <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">both copies</COREF> must be impaired .
<COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">A person who *T*-3 is born *-1 with one defective copy of a suppressor gene , or in whom one copy is damaged *-2 early in life *T*-4 ,</COREF> is especially prone to cancer because <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> need only *PRO*-5 lose the other copy for a cancer to develop .
Emerging genetic tests will be able *PRO*-1 to spot such cancer - susceptible individuals , *PRO* ushering in what some scientists believe 0 *T*-2 is a new age of predictive cancer diagnosis .
<COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Bill</COREF> and <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">Bonnie Quinlan</COREF></COREF> are among the first beneficiaries of <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">the new findings</COREF> .
<COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">The Dedham , <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">Mass.</COREF> , couple</COREF> knew even before <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">Bonnie</COREF> became pregnant in 1987 that any child of <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">theirs</COREF> had a 50 % chance of *PRO* being at risk for <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">retinoblastoma</COREF> , <COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an eye cancer that *T*-1 occurs about once every 20,000 births</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="201" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Quinlan</COREF> , <COREF ID="201" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">30 years</COREF> old ,</COREF> knew 0 <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> carried a damaged gene , *PRO*-3 having <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">lost</COREF> an eye to <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the rare tumor</COREF> when <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was only two months old *T*-1 -- after <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mother</COREF> had suffered <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">the same fate</COREF> when <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was a baby *T*-2 .
Because of the isolation of <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the retinoblastoma tumor - suppressor gene</COREF> , it *EXP*-1 became possible last January *PRO* to find out what threat <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">the Quinlan baby</COREF> faced *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">A test using new `` genetic probes ''</COREF> showed that <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">little Will Quinlan</COREF> had not inherited a damaged retinoblastoma supressor gene and , therefore , faced no more risk than other children of *PRO* developing <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the rare cancer</COREF> .
`` It made <COREF ID="200" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> New Year , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Quinlan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">This test</COREF> was the first 0 *T*-2 to predict reliably whether an individual could expect *PRO*-1 to develop cancer .
Equally important , <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">the initial discovery of <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the gene that *T*-1 controls retinal cell growth</COREF> , made * by <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">a Boston doctor named * *PRO*-3 Thaddeus Dryja</COREF> ,</COREF> has opened a field of cancer study , which *T*-2 in recent months has exploded .
`` It turns out that *PRO* studying <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">a tragic but uncommon tumor</COREF> made possible some fundamental insights about the most basic workings of cancer , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="204" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Samuel Broder</COREF> , <COREF ID="204" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the National Cancer Institute</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` All this may not be obvious to the public , which *T*-1 is concerned about advances in treatment , but <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am convinced 0 this basic research will begin *-2 showing results there soon . ''
To date , scientists have fingered two of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">these cancer - suppressors</COREF> .
<COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Dryja</COREF> made <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> retinoblastoma discovery</COREF> in 1986 .
Then last spring , researchers <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">reported</COREF> *PRO*-2 finding <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">a gene called * *PRO*-5 p53 which *T*-1 , if *PRO*-3 impaired *-4 , turns healthy colon cells *PRO*-6 cancerous</COREF> .
Soon after <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">that report</COREF> , two other research teams uncovered evidence that <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the same damaged p53 gene</COREF> is present in tissue from lung and breast cancers .
Colon , lung and breast cancers are the most common and lethal forms of the disease , collectively killing almost 200,000 Americans a year .
Right now <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">about a dozen laboratories , in <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> , Canada and <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">Britain</COREF> ,</COREF> are racing *PRO*-1 to unmask other suspected tumor - suppressing genes .
<COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have about seven candidates .
Researchers say 0 the inactivation of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">tumor - suppressor genes</COREF> , alone or in combination , appears *-1 crucial to the development of such scourges as cancer of the brain , the skin , kidney , prostate , and cervix .
There is evidence that if <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> inherit defective versions of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">these genes</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are especially prone to cancer , *PRO* perhaps explaining , finally , why some cancers seem *-2 to haunt certain families *T*-1 .
The story of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">tumor - suppressor genes</COREF> goes back to the 1970s , when <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">a pediatrician named * *PRO*-2 Alfred G. Knudson Jr.</COREF> proposed that <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">retinoblastoma</COREF> stemmed from two separate genetic defects *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">theorized</COREF> that in <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the eye cancer</COREF> , an infant inherited a damaged copy of a gene from one parent and <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">a normal copy</COREF> from the other .
<COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">The tumor</COREF> , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> suggested 0 *?* , developed when <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">the second , normal copy</COREF> also was damaged *-1 *T*-3 .
But there was no way 0 *PRO* to prove <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Knudson 's</COREF> `` two - hit '' theory</COREF> *T*-1 .
Back then , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">scientists</COREF> had no way of *PRO* ferreting out specific genes , but under a microscope <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could see the 23 pairs of chromosomes in the cells that *T*-1 contain the genes .
Occasionally , gross chromosome damage was visible .
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Knudson</COREF> found that some children with <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the eye cancer</COREF> had inherited a damaged copy of <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">chromosome No. 13</COREF> from a parent who *T*-1 had had <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the disease</COREF> .
Under a microscope <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could actually see that <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">a bit of <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">chromosome 13</COREF></COREF> was missing .
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> assumed 0 <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the missing piece</COREF> contained a gene or genes whose loss *T*-1 had a critical role in *PRO* setting off <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the cancer</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't know which gene or genes *T*-1 had disappeared .
Then , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">a scientific team led * by <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">molecular geneticist Webster Cavenee , then at the University of Utah ,</COREF></COREF> found the answer .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">The team</COREF> used a battery of <COREF ID="221" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the newly developed `` gene probes</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="221" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">snippets of genetic material that *T*-1 can track a gene 's presence in a cell</COREF> .
By *PRO*-1 analyzing cells extracted * from eye tumors , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">found</COREF> defects in the second copy of <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">chromosome 13</COREF> in the exact area as in the first copy of <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">the chromosome</COREF> .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">The finding</COREF> riveted medicine .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was the first time 0 anyone had showed that the loss of both copies of the same gene could lead to the eruption of a cancer *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was extraordinarily satisfying , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Knudson , now at Fox Chase Cancer Research Center in Philadelphia</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was convinced that what *T*-1 was true of <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">retinoblastoma</COREF> would be true for all cancers . ''
It was an audacious claim .
But in Baltimore , <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="207" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Dr. Vogelstein</COREF> , <COREF ID="207" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a young molecular biologist at <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Johns Hopkins Medical School</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> believed 0 <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Knudson</COREF> was right , and set out *PRO*-1 to repeat the <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">Cavenee</COREF> experiment in cells from other cancers .
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> was one of two research teams 0 *T*-1 in 1984 to report dual chromosome losses for a rare childhood cancer of the kidney called * *PRO*-3 Wilm 's tumor .
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Vogelstein</COREF> next turned <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> attention to <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="208" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">colon cancer</COREF> , <COREF ID="208" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the second biggest cancer killer in <COREF ID="222" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> after lung cancer</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> believed 0 <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">colon cancer</COREF> might also arise from multiple `` hits '' on <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">cancer suppressor genes</COREF> , because <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> often seems *-1 to develop in stages .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> often is preceded *-1 by the development of polyps in the bowel , which *T*-2 in some cases become increasingly malignant in identifiable stages -- *PRO*-3 progressing from less severe to deadly -- as though a cascade of genetic damage might be occurring .
<COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Vogelstein</COREF> and <COREF ID="209" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a doctoral student</COREF> , <COREF ID="209" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Eric Fearon</COREF> ,</COREF> began months of tedious and often frustrating probing of the chromosomes *PRO*-1 searching for signs of genetic damage .
<COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> began *-1 uncovering a confusing variety of genetic deletions , some existing only in benign polyps , others in malignant cells and many in both polyps and malignant cells .
Gradually , a coherent picture of cancer development emerged .
If both copies of a certain gene were knocked out , <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">benign polyps</COREF> would develop .
If both copies of a second gene were then deleted *-1 , <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">the polyps</COREF> would progress to malignancy .
It *EXP*-3 was clear that more than one gene had *-2 to be damaged *-1 for <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">colon cancer</COREF> to develop .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> report</COREF> galvanized other molecular biologists .
`` <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was the confirming evidence *ICH*-2 0 we all needed *T*-1 that -LCB- gene -RCB- losses were critical to the development of a common tumor , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Ray White at Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Salt Lake City</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Vogelstein</COREF> had yet *-2 to nail the identity of <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the gene that *T*-1 , if *PRO*-3 damaged *-4 , flipped a colon cell into full - blown malignancy</COREF> .
<COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> focused on <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">chromosome 17</COREF> .
For months <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Johns Hopkins</COREF> researchers</COREF> , *PRO*-1 using gene probes , experimentally crawled down the length of <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">chromosome 17</COREF> , *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">looking</COREF> for the smallest common bit of genetic material lost * in all tumor cells .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Such a piece of DNA</COREF> would probably constitute a gene .
When <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> found <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> last winter *T*-1 , <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Vogelstein</COREF> was dubious that <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT">the search</COREF> was over .
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> doubts stemmed from the fact that several years earlier <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="211" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Princeton University researcher</COREF> , <COREF ID="211" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Arnold Levine</COREF> ,</COREF> had found in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">experiments with mice</COREF> that <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">a gene called * *PRO*-1 p53</COREF> could transform normal cells into cancerous ones .
The deletion 0 <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Vogelstein</COREF> found *T*-1 was in exactly the same spot as <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">p53</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Levine</COREF> had said 0 <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the p53 gene</COREF> caused cancer by *PRO*-2 promoting growth , whereas <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Johns Hopkins</COREF> scientists</COREF> were looking for a gene that *T*-1 suppressed growth .
Despite that , when <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Johns Hopkins</COREF> scientists</COREF> compared <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the gene 0 <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had found *T*-2 in the human cancer cells</COREF> with <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the Mr. Levine 's</COREF> p53 gene *T*-1 <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> found 0 the two were identical ; it turned out that in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Levine 's</COREF> cancer studies</COREF> , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had unknowingly been observing a damaged form of <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="212" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">p53</COREF> -- <COREF ID="212" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a cancer - suppressing gene</COREF></COREF> .
The discovery `` suddenly puts <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">an obscure gene</COREF> right in the cockpit of cancer formation , '' says 0 *T*-1 <COREF ID="213" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Robert Weinberg</COREF> , <COREF ID="213" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a leader in cancer - gene research at Whitehead Institute in Cambridge , <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">Mass</COREF></COREF> .
Evidence *ICH*-2 now is emerging that <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the p53 suppressor gene</COREF> is involved in other cancers , too .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Researchers in Edinburgh , Scotland ,</COREF> have found that in 23 of 38 breast tumors , one copy of <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">chromosome 17</COREF> was mutated *-1 at the spot where <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">gene p53</COREF> lies *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">The scientists</COREF> say that since <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">breast cancer</COREF> often strikes multiple members of certain families , <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the gene , when *PRO* inherited in a damaged form *T*-1 ,</COREF> may predispose women to <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">the cancer</COREF> .
<COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">The p53 gene</COREF> has just been implicated *-1 in lung cancer .
In a report out last week , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">John Minna</COREF> and colleagues at <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the National Cancer Institute</COREF></COREF> say that about half the cells taken * from lung cancer tissue 0 <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> tested *T*-1 are missing <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">this gene</COREF> .
There also are reports from several labs , as yet unpublished , of missing p53 genes in tissue taken * from kidney , brain and skin cancers .
At the same time , <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Johns Hopkins</COREF> team</COREF> and others are rushing *PRO*-1 to pinpoint other tumor - suppressor genes .
<COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Vogelstein</COREF> hopes *PRO*-1 soon to isolate one on chromosome 18 , also involved in <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">colon cancer</COREF> .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Ray White in Utah</COREF> and <COREF ID="214" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Walter Bodmer</COREF> , <COREF ID="214" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a researcher in <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">Great Britain</COREF></COREF> , are close to *PRO*-1 finding another gene involved with some types of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">colon cancer</COREF> , thought * to be on chromosome 5 .
<COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Minna</COREF> believes 0 people who *T*-1 inherit a defective gene somewhere on one of their two copies of chromosome 3 are especially prone to lung cancer .
Recently , <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and others reported that <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the retinoblastoma suppressor gene</COREF> may also be involved in some lung cancers , as well as several other more common cancers , too .
Where these discoveries will lead *T*-1 , scientists can only speculate *T*-2 .
Already <COREF ID="217" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">two major pharmaceutical companies</COREF> , <COREF ID="217" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Squibb unit of Bristol - Myers Squibb Co. and Hoffmann - La Roche Inc.</COREF> , are collaborating with gene hunters *PRO*-1 to turn the anticipated cascade of discoveries into predictive tests and , maybe , new therapies .
Some researchers say 0 new cancer drugs 0 *T*-1 to slow or reverse tumor growth may be based *-2 on <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">the suppressor proteins normally produced * by <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the genes</COREF></COREF> .
The idea would be *PRO* to administer to patients <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">the growth - controlling proteins made * by healthy versions of the damaged genes</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 may even be possible *PRO* to <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">replace</COREF> defective genes with healthy versions , though no one has come close *PRO*-2 to doing <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> so far .
In any case , says 0 *?* <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Minna of <COREF ID="216" TYPE="IDENT">the National Cancer Institute</COREF></COREF> , `` We 're witnessing the discovery of one of the most important steps in the genesis of cancer .
