These are the last words 0 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Abbie Hoffman</COREF> ever uttered *T*-1 , more or less , before <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> killed <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> .
And You Are There , sort of :
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">ABBIE</COREF> : `` <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm OK , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jack</COREF> .
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm OK . ''
-LRB- *PRO* listening -RRB- `` Yeah .
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm out of bed .
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> got <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> feet on the floor .
Yeah .
Two feet .
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll see <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> Wednesday ? ... Thursday . ''
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> listens impassively .
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">ABBIE</COREF> -LRB- *PRO* cont'd. *-1 -RRB- : `` <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll always be with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jack</COREF> .
*PRO* Do n't worry . ''
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Abbie</COREF> lies back and leaves the frame *PRO*-1 empty .
Of course <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was n't the actual conversation 0 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the late <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">anti-war activist , protest leader and founder of the Yippies</COREF></COREF> ever had *T*-1 with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> brother</COREF> .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a script pieced * together from interviews by <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News</COREF> for <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="161" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a re-enactment</COREF> , <COREF ID="161" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a dramatic rendering by <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">an actor</COREF> of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hoffman 's</COREF> ultimately unsuccessful struggle with <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">depression</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">The segment</COREF> is *-2 soon to be broadcast *-3 on <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News</COREF> series `` Saturday Night With Connie Chung</COREF> , '' thus *PRO* further blurring the distinction between fiction and reality in TV news .
It is the New Journalism come to television .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chung 's</COREF> program</COREF> is just one of several network shows -LRB- and many more in syndication -RRB- that *T*-1 rely on <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the controversial technique of *PRO* reconstructing events , using actors who *T*-2 are supposed *-3 to resemble real people , living and dead</COREF> .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chung 's</COREF> , however , is said *-1 to be the only network news program in history 0 *T*-2 to employ casting directors .
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Abbie Hoffman</COREF> in this case is *-3 to be played *-1 by <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">Hollywood actor Paul Lieber , who *T*-2 is n't new to <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">the character</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hoffman</COREF> in a 1979 Los Angeles production of a play called * *PRO*-1 `` The Chicago Conspiracy Trial . ''
Television news , of course , has always been part show - biz .
Broadcasters have a healthy appreciation of the role 0 entertainment values play *T*-1 in *PRO* captivating an audience .
But , as <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">CBS Broadcast Group</COREF> president Howard Stringer puts it , <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> now needs *-1 to `` <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">broaden</COREF> the horizons of nonfiction television , and <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> includes some experimentation . ''
Since <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> premiere Sept. 16 , <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the show on which <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chung</COREF> appears *T*-1</COREF> has used <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">an actor</COREF> *PRO*-2 to portray <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="165" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Rev. Vernon Johns</COREF> , <COREF ID="165" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a civil - rights leader</COREF> ,</COREF> and one *PRO*-4 to play a teenage drug dealer .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has depicted the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over the Scottish town of Lockerbie .
On Oct. 21 , <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">a rendition of the kidnapping and imprisonment of <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson , who *T*-2 was abducted *-3 in March 1985 and is believed *-3 to be held *-1 in Lebanon</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">The production</COREF> had actors playing <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Anderson</COREF> and former hostages David Jacobsen , the Rev. Benjamin Weir and <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Father Lawrence Jenco</COREF> .
ABC News has similarly branched out into <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">entertainment gimmickry</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="167" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Prime Time Live</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="167" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a new show this season featuring <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Sam Donaldson and Diane Sawyer</COREF></COREF> , has <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">a studio audience that *T*-1 applauds and that one night -LRB- to the embarrassment of <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> -RRB- *T*-2 waved at the camera like the crowd on `` *PRO* Let 's Make a Deal</COREF> . ''
-LRB- <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">ABC</COREF> stops short of *PRO*-2 using an `` applause '' sign and a comic *PRO* to warm up <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the audience</COREF> .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The stars</COREF> do that <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> . -RRB-
<COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">NBC News</COREF> has produced three episodes of an occasional series produced * by Sid Feders called * *PRO*-2 `` Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow , '' starring Maria Shriver , Chuck Scarborough and Mary Alice Williams , that *T*-1 also gives work to actors .
*PRO* Call <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 a fad .
Or *PRO* call <COREF ID="192" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 the wave of the future .
<COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">NBC 's</COREF> re-creations are produced *-1 by Cosgrove - Meurer Productions , which *T*-2 also makes the successful prime - time NBC Entertainment series `` Unsolved Mysteries . ''
The marriage of news and theater , if not exactly inevitable , has been consummated *-1 nonetheless .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">News programs</COREF> , particularly if <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> score well in the ratings , appeal to the networks ' cost - conscious corporate parents because <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are so much less expensive *PRO* to produce *?* than an entertainment show is *?* -- somewhere between $ 400,000 and $ 500,000 *U* for a one - hour program .
Entertainment shows tend *-1 to cost twice that .
Re-enactments have been used *-1 successfully for several seasons on such syndicated `` tabloid TV '' shows as <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">`` A Current Affair , '' which *T*-3 is produced *-2 by the Fox Broadcasting Co. unit of Rupert Murdoch 's News Corp</COREF> .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">That show , whose host *T*-1 is <COREF ID="170" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Chung 's</COREF> husband</COREF> , <COREF ID="170" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Maury Povich</COREF> ,</COREF> has a particular penchant for <COREF ID="191" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">grisly murders and stories having * to do with sex</COREF> -- <COREF ID="191" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Robert Chambers murder case , the Rob Lowe tapes , what have *T*-2 you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Gerald Stone</COREF> , <COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the executive producer of `` <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">A Current Affair</COREF></COREF> , '' says , `` We have opened eyes to *PRO* being a little less conservative and more imaginative in how *PRO* to present the news *T*-1 . ''
Nowhere have eyes been opened *-1 wider than at <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News</COREF> .
At 555 W. 57th St. in Manhattan , one floor below the offices of `` <COREF ID="172" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">60 Minutes</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="172" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the most successful prime - time news program ever</COREF> , actors wait in the reception area *PRO*-1 to audition for `` <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Saturday Night With Connie Chung</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News</COREF> sends <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">scripts</COREF> to agents , who *T*-1 pass <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> along to clients .
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">The network</COREF> deals a lot with unknowns , including Scott Wentworth , who *T*-1 portrayed <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Anderson</COREF> , and Bill Alton as <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">Father Jenco</COREF> , but <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> has some big names 0 *PRO* to contend with *T*-2 , too .
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">James Earl Jones</COREF> is cast *-1 *PRO*-2 to play <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the Rev. Mr. Johns</COREF> .
Ned Beatty may portray former California Gov. Pat Brown in a forthcoming epsiode on <COREF ID="175" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Caryl Chessman</COREF> , <COREF ID="175" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the last man 0 *T*-2 to be executed *-1 in California , in 1960</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Saturday Night</COREF> '' has cast actors *PRO*-2 to appear in future stories ranging from the abortion rights of teen - agers to a Nov. 4 segment on a man named * *PRO*-4 Willie Bosket , who *T*-1 calls himself *PRO*-5 a `` monster '' and is reputed *-3 to be the toughest prisoner in New York .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News , which as recently as two years ago *T*-1 fired hundreds of its employees in budget cutbacks ,</COREF> now hires featured actors beginning at <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">$ 2,700 *U* a week</COREF> .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is n't much compared with what Bill Cosby makes *T*-4 , or even <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">Connie Chung for that matter -LRB- who *T*-2 is paid *-1 $ 1.6 million *U* a year and who *T*-3 recently did a guest shot of her own on the sitcom `` Murphy Brown '' -RRB-</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the money</COREF> is n't peanuts either , particularly for a news program .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News</COREF> is also re-enacting the 1979 Three Mile Island nuclear accident in <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Middletown , Pa.</COREF> , with something less than a cast of thousands .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is combing <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the town of 10,000</COREF> for about 200 extras .
On Oct. 20 , <COREF ID="176" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the town 's</COREF> mayor</COREF> , <COREF ID="176" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Robert Reid</COREF> , made an announcement on behalf of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">CBS</COREF> during half - time at the Middletown High School football game *PRO*-1 asking for volunteers .
`` There was a roll of laughter through the stands , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="177" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Joe Sukle</COREF> , <COREF ID="177" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the editor of the weekly Press and Journal in <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Middletown</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're filming right now at the bank down the street , and <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want shots of people getting out of cars and kids on skateboards .
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are approaching <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">everyone</COREF> on the street</COREF> and asking if <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to be in a docudrama . ''
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Sukle</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would n't dream of *PRO*-1 participating <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> :
`` No way .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 re-enactments stink . ''
Though <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">a re-enactment</COREF> may have the flavor , Hollywood on the Hudson <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is n't *-1 .
Some producers seem *-1 tentative about <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the technique</COREF> , squeamish even .
So the results , while not news , are n't exactly theater either , at least not good theater .
And some people do think that *PRO* acting out scripts is n't worthy of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News , which *T*-1 once lent prestige to <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> and set standards for the industry</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> review of `` <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Saturday Night With Connie Chung</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tom Shales</COREF> , <COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the TV critic of the Washington Post and generally an admirer of <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">CBS</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> wrote that while <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the show</COREF> is `` impressive , ... one has *-1 to wonder if this is the proper direction 0 for a network news division to take *T*-2 . ''
*PRO* Re-creating events has , in general , upset news traditionalists , including former <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News</COREF> President Richard S. Salant and former <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">NBC News</COREF> President Reuven Frank , former <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News</COREF> anchorman Walter Cronkite and <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="187" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the new dean</COREF> of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism , <COREF ID="187" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Joan Konner</COREF></COREF> .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> : `` Once you add <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">dramatizations</COREF> , <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's no longer news , <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">drama</COREF> , and <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> has no place on a network news broadcast ... .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> should never be on .
Never . ''
Criticism of <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Abbie Hoffman</COREF> segment</COREF> is particularly scathing among <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">people who *T*-1 knew and loved <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> includes <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="182" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> companion of 15 years</COREF> , <COREF ID="182" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Johanna Lawrenson</COREF> ,</COREF> as well as <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> former wife</COREF> , <COREF ID="183" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Anita</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Both women</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> also find it *EXP*-1 distasteful that <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News</COREF> is apparently concentrating on <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hoffman 's</COREF> problems as a manic - depressive .
`` <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is dangerous and misrepresents <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Abbie 's</COREF> life , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Lawrenson , who *T*-1 has had an advance look at <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the 36 - page script</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a sensational piece about <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">someone who *T*-1 is not here *PRO*-2 to defend himself</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Hoffman</COREF> says that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">dramatization</COREF> `` makes the truth flexible .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> takes <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">one person 's account</COREF> and gives <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> authenticity . ''
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">CBS News</COREF> interviewed <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jack Hoffman</COREF> and <COREF ID="184" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> sister</COREF> , <COREF ID="184" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Phyllis</COREF> , as well as <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hoffman 's</COREF> landlord in Solebury Township , Pa .
Also <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Jonathan Silvers , who *T*-1 collaborated with <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hoffman</COREF> on two books</COREF> .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Silvers</COREF> says , `` <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wanted *PRO*-2 to be interviewed *-1 *PRO*-2 to get <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Abbie 's</COREF> story out , and maybe *PRO* talking about <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">the illness</COREF> will do some good .
