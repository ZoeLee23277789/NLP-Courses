<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">IRS</COREF> warnings</COREF> stem from <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">a 1984 law that *T*-1 <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">requires</COREF> anyone who *T*-126 receives more than $ 10,000 *U* in cash from <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">a client or customer</COREF> in one or more related transactions `` in the course of trade or business '' *PRO*-127 to report <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">the payment</COREF> on <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">a document known * as Form 8300</COREF></COREF> .

<COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ross</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">met</COREF> with officials of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> and <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the Justice Department , which *T*-133 would bring any enforcement actions against taxpayers ,</COREF> *PRO*-1 to discuss <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> last May .

<COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ross</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">IRS</COREF> officials opposed <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the Justice Department 's</COREF> moderate stance on <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the matter</COREF> .
But in <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the letters sent * in recent days</COREF> , Christopher J.

In some cases , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> asked for information dating back to forms 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> received *T*-1 in <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">1985</COREF> .

<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Prosecutors</COREF> need court permission *PRO*-1 to obtain the tax returns of an individual or a business .
But <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have obtained 8300 forms without court permission and used <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the information</COREF> *PRO*-1 to help develop criminal cases .
