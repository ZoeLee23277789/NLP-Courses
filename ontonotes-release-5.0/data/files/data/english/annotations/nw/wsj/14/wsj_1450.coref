<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">The Bakersfield Supermarket</COREF> went out of business last May .
The reason was not high interest rates or labor costs .
Nor was there a shortage of customers in <COREF ID="103" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the area</COREF> , <COREF ID="103" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the residential Inwood section of northern Manhattan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">The business</COREF> closed when <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">the owner</COREF> was murdered *-1 by robbers *T*-2 .
The owner was <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Israel Ortiz</COREF> , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a 29 - year - old entrepreneur and father of two</COREF></COREF> .
In <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first year of *PRO* operating <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the store 0 <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> bought *T*-2 for $ 220,000 *U*</COREF> , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ortiz</COREF> was robbed *-1 at least twice at gunpoint .
The first time <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was shot *-1 in the hand as <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> chased the robbers outside .
The second time <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> identified two robbers , who *T*-1 were arrested and charged .
Two weeks later -- perhaps in retaliation -- <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ortiz</COREF> was <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">shot</COREF> *-1 three times in the back , during what police classified *T*-2 as a third robbery attempt .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> was <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> reward for *PRO* working until 11 p.m. seven days a week *PRO*-1 to cover <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> $ 3,000 *U* a month rent .
For *PRO* providing what <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> customers described *T*-1 as very personal and helpful service .
For *PRO* creating a focus for neighborhood life .
<COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Israel Ortiz</COREF> is only one of the thousands of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">entrepreneurs</COREF> and <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> employees who *T*-1 will be injured or killed *-2 by crime this year .
The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that almost 2 % of all retail - sales workers suffer injuries from crime each year , almost twice the national average and about four times the rate for teachers , truck drivers , medical workers and door - to - door salespeople .
Only a few other occupations *ICH*-1 have higher reported rates of criminal injury , such as police , bartenders and taxi drivers .
Yet these figures show only the most visible part of the problem .
Recent data from <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> provide more of the picture .
While by no means the highest crime community in the country , <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> is a prime example of a city where crime strangles small - business development *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">A survey of small businesses <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">there</COREF></COREF> was conducted *-1 this spring by <COREF ID="106" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Interface</COREF> , <COREF ID="106" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a policy research organization</COREF> .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> gave 1,124 businesses a questionnaire and analyzed 353 responses .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">The survey</COREF> found that over a three - year period 22 % of <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the firms</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">employees or owners</COREF> had been robbed *-1 on <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> way to or from work or while on the job .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Seventeen percent</COREF> reported <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> customers being robbed *-1 .
Crime was the reason that 26 % reported difficulty *PRO* recruiting personnel and that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">19 %</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were considering moving .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">More than one - third</COREF> of <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the responding businesses</COREF></COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> suffer from drug dealing and loitering near <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> premises .
In Brooklyn and the Bronx , one out of four commercial firms is burglarized *-1 each year .
Industrial neighborhoods fare even worse , with burglary rates twice the citywide average .
Crime is clearly more deadly to small - scale entrepreneurship than to big businesses .
Two decades ago , the Small Business Administration reported <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Yale Prof. Albert Reiss 's</COREF> landmark study of crime against 2,500 small businesses drawn * from national IRS records .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> found that monetary crime losses , as a proportion of gross receipts , were 37 times higher for small businesses than for large ones .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> study 's</COREF> companies</COREF> averaged 27 employees ; <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> annual crime losses averaged about $ 15,000 *U* , with an additional $ 8,385 *U* annual cost in security -- enough money *PRO* to hire at least one more worker .
The costs of crime may also be enough *PRO* to destroy a struggling business .
Whatever <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the monetary crime losses</COREF> , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may not be nearly as important to entrepreneurs as the risk of personal injury .
After repeated gun robberies , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">some entrepreneurs</COREF> may give up a business out of fear for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">One Washington couple</COREF> recently sold <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> liquor store after 34 years in business that *T*-1 included four robbery deaths and 16 robberies or burglaries on the premises .
These findings illustrate the vicious cycle that <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">National Institute of Justice</COREF> Director James K. Stewart calls *T*-1 *PRO*-2 `` crime causing poverty . ''
Underclass neighborhoods offer relatively few employment opportunities , *PRO* contributing to the poverty of local residents .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Small neighborhood businesses</COREF> could provide more jobs , if crime were not so harmful to *PRO* creating and maintaining <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">those businesses</COREF> .
This may help *PRO* explain why small businesses create 65 % of all jobs nationally , but only 22 % of jobs in a crime - ridden city like <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> *T*-2 .
Bigger business can often better afford *PRO*-1 to minimize the cost of crime .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> study</COREF> found that the cost of security measures in firms with fewer than five employees was almost $ 1,000 *U* per worker , compared with one - third that amount for firms with more than 10 employees .
The shift of retailing to <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">large shopping centers</COREF> has created even greater economies of scale for *PRO* providing low - crime business environments .
Private security guards and moonlighting police can invoke the law of trespass *PRO*-1 to regulate access to <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">these quasi-public places</COREF> .
Since 1984 , in fact , revenues of the 10 largest guard companies , primarily serving such big businesses , have increased by almost 62 % .
Few small neighborhood businesses , however , can afford such protection , even in collaboration with other local merchants .
In the neighborhoods with the highest crime rates , small business generally <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">relies</COREF> on the public police force for protection .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> creates several problems .
One is that there are not enough police *PRO* to satisfy small businesses .
The number one proposal for *PRO* reducing crime in <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> survey</COREF> was *PRO* to put more police on foot or scooter patrol , *PRO* suggested by more than two - thirds of the respondents .
Only 22 % supported private security patrols funded * by the merchants themselves .
A second problem is the persistent frustration of false alarms , which *T*-1 can make urban police less than enthusiastic about *PRO* responding to calls from small businesses .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Only half the <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> small businesses surveyed *</COREF> , for <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> part , are satisfied with the police response 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> receive *T*-1 .
Some cities , including <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> , have experimented with <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">special tax districts for commercial areas that *T*-1 provide additional patrols funded * by local businesses</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> raises added cost barriers to urban entrepreneurship .
Another solution 0 cities might consider *T*-1 is *PRO* giving special priority to police patrols of small - business areas .
For cities losing business to suburban shopping centers , it *EXP*-1 may be a wise business investment *PRO* to help *PRO* keep those jobs and sales taxes within city limits .
Increased patrolling of business zones makes sense because urban crime is heavily concentrated in such `` hot spots '' of pedestrian density .
With <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">National Institute of Justice</COREF> support , the Minneapolis police and <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the Crime Control Institute</COREF> are currently testing the effects of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">such a strategy</COREF> , *PRO*-1 comparing <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> deterrence value with traditional random patrols .
Small - business patrols would be an especially helpful gesture whenever a small - business person is scheduled *-2 *PRO*-3 to testify against a robbery suspect *T*-1 .
While no guarantee , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">an increased police presence</COREF> might even deter further attacks .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> might even have saved the life , and business , of <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">Israel Ortiz</COREF> .
