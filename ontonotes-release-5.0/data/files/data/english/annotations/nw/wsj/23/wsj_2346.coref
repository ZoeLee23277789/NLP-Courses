The real estate slump that *T*-1 's <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">pushing</COREF> down the price of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> office space and housing is also affecting the <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">city</COREF> 's retail real estate market .
In <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Manhattan</COREF> , once - desirable store sites sit *PRO*-2 vacant and newly constructed space has been slow 0 *PRO* to fill *T*-1 .
Retail real estate brokers say 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">tenants</COREF> are reluctant *PRO*-1 to sign leases because of uncertainty about the local economy , turmoil in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own industries and a belief that rents have not yet hit bottom .
`` There is an unbelievable amount of space available , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Faith Consolo</COREF> , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">senior vice president at Garrick - Aug Associates Store Leasing Inc</COREF></COREF> .
There are about 2,000 stores for rent , up from a more typical range of 1,200 to 1,500 .
`` This further confuses <COREF ID="wsj_2346-E3" TYPE="IDENT">retailers</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="wsj_2346-E3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> wonder should <COREF ID="wsj_2346-E3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> sign a lease if prices are still coming down ?
Is this the wrong time 0 *PRO* to open a store *T*-1 ?
Who *T*-1 is going *-2 to be in the space next door ? ''
In addition , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Consolo</COREF> says 0 *?* , tenants usually can negotiate *PRO*-2 to pay rents that *T*-1 are about one - quarter lower than landlords ' initial asking price .
A handful of hot retail locations , such as the 57th Street and <COREF ID="wsj_2346.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Madison</COREF> and <COREF ID="wsj_2346.sgm-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Fifth Avenue</COREF> areas , have been able *PRO*-1 to sustain what many see *T*-2 as astronomical rents .
And , in some neighborhoods , rents have merely hit a plateau .
But on average , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Manhattan</COREF> retail rents have <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">dropped</COREF> 10 % to 15 % in the past six months alone , experts say 0 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> follows a more subtle decline in the prior six months , after <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Manhattan</COREF> rents had run up rapidly since 1986 .
The same factors limiting demand for office space have affected retailing .
`` As businesses contract or depart , the number of employees who *T*-1 might use retail services shrinks , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Edward A. Friedman</COREF> , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">senior vice president of Helmsley Spear Inc</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 financial problems plaguing electronics , fur and furniture companies -- key categories in the local retail economy -- have further deflated the market .
Hardest hit *-2 are *T*-1 what <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> calls *T*-3 *PRO*-5 <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">`` secondary '' sites that *T*-4 primarily serve neighborhood residents</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">these locations</COREF> , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Friedman</COREF> says 0 *?* , `` Retailers are increasingly cautious about *PRO*-2 expanding and rents have remained steady or in some cases have declined . ''
Weakness in the restaurant industry , which *T*-1 is leaving retail space *PRO*-2 vacant , exacerbates the problem for landlords .
It *EXP*-2 is also no comfort to landlords and small <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> retailers when the future of larger department stores , which *T*-1 anchor retail neighborhoods , are in doubt *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="157" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hooker Corp.</COREF> , <COREF ID="157" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">parent of Bonwit Teller and B. Altman 's</COREF> , is mired *-1 in bankruptcy proceedings and <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">Bloomingdale 's</COREF> is for sale by <COREF ID="168" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> owner</COREF> , <COREF ID="168" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Campeau Corp</COREF> .
The trend toward lower rents may seem *-1 surprising given that some communities in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> are bemoaning the loss of favorite local businesses to high rents .
But , despite the recent softening , for <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">many of these retailers</COREF> there 's still been too big a jump from the rental rates of the late 1970s , when <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> leases were signed *-1 *T*-2 .
Certainly , <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the recent drop in prices</COREF> does n't mean 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Manhattan</COREF> comes cheap .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> retail rents still run well above the going rate in other U.S. cities .
<COREF ID="wsj_2346.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Madison</COREF> and <COREF ID="wsj_2346.sgm-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Fifth Avenues</COREF> and East 57th Street can command rents of up to $ 500 *U* a square foot , and $ 250 *U* is not uncommon .
The thriving 34th Street area offers rents of about $ 100 *U* a square foot , as do up - and - coming locations along lower Fifth Avenue *?* .
By contrast , rentals in the best retail locations in Boston , San Francisco and Chicago rarely top $ 100 *U* a square foot .
And rents on Beverly Hills ' Rodeo Drive generally do n't exceed about $ 125 *U* a square foot .
