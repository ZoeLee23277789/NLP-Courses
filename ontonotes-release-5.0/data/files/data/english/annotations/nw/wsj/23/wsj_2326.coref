<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> , *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to blunt growing demands from Western Europe for a relaxation of controls on exports to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviet bloc</COREF> , is questioning whether <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Italy</COREF> 's Ing . C. Olivetti -AMP- Co.</COREF> supplied militarily valuable technology to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviets</COREF> .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Most of the Western European members of <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls</COREF> , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the unofficial forum through which <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> allies</COREF> align <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> export - control policies *T*-2</COREF></COREF></COREF> , are expected *-3 to argue for more liberal export rules at a meeting 0 *T*-4 to be held *-1 in Paris Oct. 25 and 26 .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> plan *PRO*-1 to press specifically for a relaxation of rules governing exports of machine tools , computers and other high - technology products .
But <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to see evidence that all <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Cocom</COREF> members are complying fully with existing export - control procedures before <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will support further liberalization .
*PRO*-2 To make <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> point , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is challenging <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the Italian government</COREF> *PRO*-3 to explain <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">reports that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Olivetti</COREF> may have supplied <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviet Union</COREF> with sophisticated computer - driven devices that *T*-1 could be used *-4 *PRO* to build parts for combat aircraft</COREF> .
The London Sunday Times , which *T*-1 first reported the U.S. concerns , cited a U.S. intelligence report as the source of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the allegations that Olivetti <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">exported</COREF> $ 25 million *U* in `` <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">embargoed , state - of - the - art , flexible manufacturing systems</COREF> to the Soviet aviation industry</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Olivetti</COREF> reportedly began *-1 shipping <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">these tools</COREF> in 1984 .
A <COREF ID="wsj_2326.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">State Department</COREF> spokesman acknowledged that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> is discussing <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the allegations</COREF> with <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the Italian government</COREF> and <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Cocom</COREF> , but declined *PRO*-1 to confirm any details .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Italian President Francesco Cossiga</COREF> promised a quick investigation into whether <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Olivetti</COREF> broke <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Cocom</COREF> rules .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> called <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> attention to the matter during <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the Italian leader 's</COREF> visit here last week .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Olivetti</COREF> has denied that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> violated <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Cocom</COREF> rules , *PRO*-2 asserting that <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the reported shipments</COREF> were properly licensed *-1 by the Italian authorities .
Although the legality of these sales is still an open question , the disclosure could n't be better timed *-2 *PRO* to support the position of export - control hawks in <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon</COREF> and the intelligence community .
`` It seems to <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> that a story like this breaks just before every important <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Cocom</COREF> meeting , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">a Washington lobbyist for a number of U.S. computer companies</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> has sent conflicting signals about <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> export - control policies , *PRO* reflecting unhealed divisions among several competing agencies .
Last summer , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> moved <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> in the direction of gradual liberalization when <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> told a North Atlantic Treaty Organization meeting that <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would allow some exceptions to the <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Cocom</COREF> embargo of strategic goods *T*-1 .
But more recently , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon</COREF> and the Commerce Department</COREF> openly feuded over the extent to which <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Cocom</COREF> should liberalize exports of personal computers to <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the bloc</COREF> *T*-1 .
However , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">these agencies</COREF> generally agree that the West should be cautious about any further liberalization .
`` There 's no evidence that the Soviet program 0 *T*-2 to -LRB- illegally -RRB- acquire Western technology has diminished , '' said *T*-1 a <COREF ID="wsj_2326.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">State Department</COREF> spokesman .
