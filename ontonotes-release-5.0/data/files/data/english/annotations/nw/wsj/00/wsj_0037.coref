*PRO* Judging from the Americana in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">Haruki Murakami 's</COREF> `` A Wild Sheep Chase '' -LRB- <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">Kodansha</COREF> , 320 pages , $ 18.95 *U* -RRB-</COREF> , baby boomers on both sides of the Pacific have a lot in common .
Although *PRO*-2 set *-1 in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> , <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the novel 's</COREF> texture is almost entirely Western , especially American .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Characters</COREF> drink Salty Dogs , whistle `` Johnny B. Goode '' and watch Bugs Bunny reruns .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> read Mickey Spillane and talk about Groucho and Harpo .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> worry about <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> careers , drink too much and suffer through broken marriages and desultory affairs .
This is <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> ?
For an American reader , part of the charm of <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">this engaging novel</COREF> should come in *PRO* recognizing that <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> is n't the buttoned - down society of contemporary American lore .
It *EXP*-1 's also refreshing *PRO* to read a Japanese author who *T*-52 clearly does n't belong to the self - aggrandizing `` we - Japanese '' school of writers who *T*-53 perpetuate the notion of the unique Japanese , unfathomable by outsiders .
If `` <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">A Wild Sheep Chase</COREF> '' carries <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">an implicit message for international relations</COREF> , <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's that the Japanese are more like <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> than most of <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> think 0 *?* .
That 's not *PRO* to say that <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the nutty plot of `` <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">A Wild Sheep Chase</COREF> ''</COREF> is rooted *-57 in reality .
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's imaginative and often funny .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">A disaffected , hard - drinking , nearly - 30 hero</COREF> sets off for snow country in search of an elusive sheep with a star on its back at the behest of a sinister , erudite mobster with a Stanford degree .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has in tow <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> prescient girlfriend , whose sassy retorts *T*-54 mark her as anything but a docile butterfly .
Along the way , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> meets a solicitous Christian chauffeur who *T*-55 offers <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the hero</COREF> God 's phone number ; and <COREF ID="173" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Sheep Man</COREF> , <COREF ID="173" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a sweet , roughhewn figure who *T*-56 wears -- what else -- a sheepskin</COREF> .
<COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">The 40 - year - old Mr. Murakami</COREF> is a publishing sensation in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="139" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">A more recent novel</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="139" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Norwegian Wood</COREF> '' -LRB- every Japanese under 40 seems *-1 to be fluent in <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">Beatles</COREF> lyrics -RRB- ,</COREF> has sold more than four million copies since <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">Kodansha</COREF> published <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in <COREF ID="171" TYPE="IDENT">1987</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is just one of <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="142" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">several youthful writers</COREF> -- <COREF ID="142" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo 's</COREF> brat pack</COREF> -- who *T*-57 are dominating the best - seller charts in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> books are written *-1 in idiomatic , contemporary language and usually carry hefty dashes of Americana .
In <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Robert Whiting 's</COREF> `` You Gotta Have Wa '' -LRB- Macmillan , 339 pages , $ 17.95 *U* -RRB-</COREF> , <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the Beatles</COREF> give way to baseball , in the Nipponese version 0 we would be hard put *PRO*-2 to call *T*-1 *PRO*-3 a `` game . ''
As <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Whiting</COREF> describes <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Nipponese baseball</COREF> is a `` mirror of <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan 's</COREF> fabled virtues of hard work and harmony . ''
`` <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Wa</COREF> '' is Japanese for `` team spirit '' and Japanese ballplayers have miles and miles of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">A player 's</COREF> commitment to practice and team image is as important as <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> batting average .
Polls once named <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo Giants</COREF> star Tatsunori Hara , a `` humble , uncomplaining , obedient soul , '' as the male symbol of <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> .
But other than the fact that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">besuboru</COREF> is played *-1 with a ball and a bat , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's unrecognizable : Fans politely return foul balls to stadium ushers ; the strike zone expands depending on the size of the hitter ; <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">ties</COREF> are permitted *-2 -- even welcomed *-2 -- since <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> honorably sidestep the shame of defeat ; <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">players</COREF> must abide by strict rules of conduct even in <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> personal lives -- players for <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the Tokyo Giants</COREF> , for example , must always wear ties when on the road *T*-3 .
`` <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">You Gotta Have Wa</COREF> '' is the often amusing chronicle of how American ballplayers , rationed * to two per team , fare *T*-1 in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> .
Despite <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the enormous sums of money 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're paid *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">stand</COREF> up at a Japanese plate</COREF> , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">a good number</COREF> decide 0 <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not worth <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and run for <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">home</COREF> .
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">`` Funny Business '' -LRB- Soho , 228 pages , $ 17.95 *U* -RRB- by <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Gary Katzenstein</COREF></COREF> is anything but *?* .
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's the petulant complaint of an impudent American whom <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Sony</COREF> hosted *T*-58 for a year while he was on a Luce Fellowship in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> -- to the regret of both parties .
In sometimes amusing , more often supercilious , even vicious passages , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Katzenstein</COREF> describes how <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Sony</COREF> invades even the most mundane aspects of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> workers ' lives -- at the regimented office , where employees are assigned *-59 lunch partners *T*-1 -- and at `` home '' in the austere company dormitory run * by a prying caretaker *T*-2 .
Some of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> observations about Japanese management style are on the mark .
It *EXP*-3 's probably true that many salarymen put in unproductive overtime just for the sake of solidarity , that the system is so hierarchical that only the assistant manager can talk to <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the manager</COREF> and <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the manager</COREF> to the general manager , and that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Sony</COREF> was chary of *PRO*-4 letting a young , short - term American employee take on any responsibility .
All of this must have been enormously frustrating to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Katzenstein , who *T*-59 went to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Sony</COREF> with degrees in business and computer science and was raring *PRO*-1 to invent another Walkman</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Sony</COREF> ultimately took a lesson from the American management books and fired <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Katzenstein</COREF> , after <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> committed the social crime of *PRO* making an appointment *PRO* to <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">see</COREF> <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="149" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the venerable Akio Morita</COREF> , <COREF ID="149" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">founder of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Sony</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 's a shame 0 <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT">their meeting</COREF> never took place .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Katzenstein</COREF> certainly would have learned something , and it *EXP*-1 's even possible 0 <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Morita</COREF> would have *?* too .

More and more corners of the globe are becoming free of tobacco smoke .
In <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Singapore</COREF> , <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">a new law</COREF> requires <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">smokers</COREF> *PRO*-1 to put out <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cigarettes before *PRO* entering restaurants , department stores and sports centers or face a $ 250 *U* fine .
Discos and private clubs are exempt from <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">the ban</COREF> , and smoking will be permitted *-60 in bars except during meal hours , an official said 0 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Singapore</COREF> already bans smoking in all theaters , buses , public elevators , hospitals and fast - food restaurants .
In Malaysia , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Siti Zaharah Sulaiman</COREF> , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a deputy minister in the prime minister 's office</COREF> , launched a `` No - Smoking Week '' at the Mara Institute of Technology near Kuala Lumpur and urged other schools *PRO*-1 to ban on - campus smoking .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">South Korea</COREF> has different concerns .
In Seoul , officials began *-1 visiting about 26,000 cigarette stalls *PRO*-1 to remove illegal posters and signboards advertising imported cigarettes .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">South Korea</COREF> has opened <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> market to foreign cigarettes but restricts advertising to designated places .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">A marketing study</COREF> indicates that <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> consumers</COREF> are the most materialistic in the 14 major markets where <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the survey</COREF> was carried out *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">The study by the Backer Spielvogel Bates ad agency</COREF> also found that <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the colony 's</COREF> consumers</COREF> feel more pressured than those in any of the other surveyed markets , which *T*-60 include <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">The survey</COREF> found that nearly half of <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> consumers</COREF> espouse what <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> identified *T*-61 as materialistic values , compared with about one - third in <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> and <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">More than three in five</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are under a great deal of stress most of the time , compared with less than one in two U.S. consumers and one in four in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> .
The Thai cabinet endorsed Finance Minister Pramual Sabhavasu 's proposal *PRO* to build a $ 19 million *U* conference center for a joint meeting of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund two years from now .
The meeting , which *T*-62 is expected *-1 to draw 20,000 to Bangkok , was going *-2 to be held *-61 at <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the Central Plaza Hotel</COREF> , but the government balked at <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the hotel 's</COREF> conditions for *PRO* undertaking necessary expansion .
A major concern about the current plan is whether the new center can be built *-62 in such a short time .
