<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nelson Bunker Hunt 's</ENAMEX> attempted corner on silver <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</ENAMEX> is still haunting the market in this metal .
Silver , now trading <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 5</ENAMEX> an ounce , surged to an all - time peak of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">50</ENAMEX> an ounce in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1980</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">around $ 9</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-1979</ENAMEX> .
`` Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> 's attempt to squeeze the silver market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 years ago</ENAMEX> is still indirectly to blame for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> 's market depression , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesley Edgar</ENAMEX> , managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sharps Pixley Ltd.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> bullion brokers .
While <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">some 100 million ounces</ENAMEX> of silver once held by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> associates are n't hanging over the market anymore , the price surge of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979 - 80</ENAMEX> precipitated an expansion of mine production and scrap recovery and encouraged silver consumers to economize on silver use , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edgar</ENAMEX> says .
Photographic developers , for example , bought equipment to recover silver from spent photographs , negatives and processing solutions .
Meanwhile , the photographic industry , which accounts for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">44 %</ENAMEX> of silver consumption , continues to look for substitutes .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> photographic firms are beginning to produce electronic cameras and X-rays that do n't require silver , dealers say .
Silver 's history of volatility is also discouraging investors , dealers say .
Even in the present uncertain investment climate , investors are preferring `` quality assets '' such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills and bonds to gold , silver and platinum , dealers say .
Although prices rallied briefly following the tumble on world stock markets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</ENAMEX> and the related decline of the dollar , precious metals are out of favor for the moment because of high interest rates and a determination by industrial nations to curb inflation , dealers say .
Silver , however is in a deeper slump than are gold and platinum .
Some analysts contend that silver is cheap now that prices are languishing at levels last seen in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the mid-1970s</ENAMEX> .
`` Bargain hunters believe that silver offers the best value amongst precious metals , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick R. Demler</ENAMEX> , analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc</ENAMEX> .
A further decline in prices will lead to mine production cuts in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> , he says .
Scrap merchants are converting smaller quantities of metal into silver , while low prices are discouraging exports from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> .
Silver prices could also be boosted by strikes in leading producing nations <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Peru</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demler</ENAMEX> says .
Meanwhile , total fabrication demand for silver has risen <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six years</ENAMEX> in a row , he says .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> demand grew by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of this year</ENAMEX> and the nation plans an issue of a silver commemorative coin that will require <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">4.5 million ounces</ENAMEX> .
Compared with huge <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> surpluses of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">more than 100 million ounces</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the first half of the 1980s</ENAMEX> , world silver supplies and consumption are now nearly in balance , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Demler</ENAMEX> says .
Despite intermittent rallies in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past few years</ENAMEX> , improvements in the supply - demand balance have n't managed to push silver prices into a higher range .
`` There 's just too much silver around , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Butler</ENAMEX> , an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Samuel Montagu -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> bullion house .
A huge silver stockpile at exchanges , refiners , consuming industries and government warehouses of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">at least 617 million ounces</ENAMEX> is the market depressant , says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</ENAMEX> in a report .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">This year alone</ENAMEX> , inventories at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Commodity Exchange of New York</ENAMEX> jumped `` by a staggering <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">46 million</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">221 million ounces</ENAMEX> '' because of producer deliveries , de-stocking by fabricators and sales by disenchanted investors , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhona O'Connell</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> - based precious metals analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton</ENAMEX> .
`` Silver production is also in an inexorable upward trend , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Connell</ENAMEX> says .
Moreover , while <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Asian</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Middle Eastern</ENAMEX> investors hoard gold and help underpin its price , silver does n't have the same mystique , dealers say .
Investors have gotten burned on silver so often that they are far more partial to gold , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Urs Seiler</ENAMEX> , senior vice president at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Union Bank</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Switzerland</ENAMEX> .
Yet if gold prices improve , silver prices could rally sharply , he says .
However , dealers caution that any increase would be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 to $ 2</ENAMEX> at most .
Looking ahead to other commodity markets <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> :
Livestock and Meats
Analysts expect the prices of live cattle futures contracts to rise in trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> in the wake of a government <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</ENAMEX> census that found fewer - than - expected cattle on feedlots .
After the close of trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> reported that feedlots in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> biggest ranch states held <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8.06 million</ENAMEX> cattle on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 1</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">6 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that date a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
Most analysts had expected the government to report a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</ENAMEX> decline .
Feedlots fatten young cattle for slaughter , so a decline signals a tightening supply of beef .
The government reported that the number of young cattle placed on feedlots during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year - earlier quarter</ENAMEX> .
Many industry analysts had been projecting a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3 %</ENAMEX> decline in placements for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1988 quarter</ENAMEX> , many farmers were forced to sell their cattle to feedlot operators because the drought dried out the pasture on their ranches .
The number of cattle moving onto feedlots in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the recent quarter</ENAMEX> was also lower because fattening cattle is less profitable .
A shortage of young cattle has made them more expensive for feedlot operators to buy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Agriculture Department</ENAMEX> also said that the number of fattened cattle slaughtered in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> dropped by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1988 quarter</ENAMEX> , which was in line with projections by analysts .
Energy
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">44 - cent</ENAMEX> - a - barrel price drop to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">19.98</ENAMEX> in the expiring <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> contract for <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">West Texas Intermediate</ENAMEX> crude may well set the tone for trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> in petroleum futures on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Mercantile Exchange</ENAMEX> .
Most traders and analysts attributed the decline to technical factors associated with the contract 's going off the board .
Others said that the drop continued the downward correction that 's been due in the petroleum pits and that such a trend could well continue in the next several trading sessions .
Barring any petroleum - related news events , trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</ENAMEX> ahead should further test recent projections by oil economists and other market watchers that strong <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fourth - quarter</ENAMEX> demand will keep prices firm .
Copper
Copper prices fell sharply <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> .
For example , copper for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> delivery settled <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.5 cents</ENAMEX> lower at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.2345</ENAMEX> a pound .
Pressure came from several developments including the settlement of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> long - term strikes .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst said , rank - and - file workers ratified a new labor agreement ending a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> strike at the <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Highland Valley</ENAMEX> mine in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">British Columbia</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mexico</ENAMEX> , the analyst added , employees at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cananea</ENAMEX> mine , who have been out of work since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late August</ENAMEX> when the mine was declared bankrupt by the government , accepted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">35 %</ENAMEX> cut in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3,800</ENAMEX> - man work force .
The mine is expected to return to production in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a week</ENAMEX> .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , selling dominated the afternoon `` curb '' session in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> , which takes place at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon EDT</ENAMEX> .
The premium of cash copper to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three - month</ENAMEX> forward offerings narrowed , indicating weaker demand for cash copper .
Long - term support for the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract was believed to be at $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.25</ENAMEX> a pound .
A technical analyst said there were a number of stop - loss orders under that level that were touched off when the contract 's price fell below it .
That brought in considerable fund selling , which continued until the close of trading .
`` In general , it was a bearish close , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ben Hanauer</ENAMEX> , a copper trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rudolph Wolff -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , a major commodities trading and brokerage firm .
But whether this price break has implications for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</ENAMEX> , he said , `` we will know more when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">London Metal Exchange</ENAMEX> copper stock levels are released <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> . ''
Another analyst said he expected <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LME</ENAMEX> inventories to be down by <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 15,000 tons</ENAMEX> when the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> report is issued .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Savaiko</ENAMEX> , senior commodities analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> , said that when traders saw the market was n't reacting positively to the forecasts of lower <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">LME</ENAMEX> stocks , they perceived a bearish sign .
He also noted that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> , who had been buying at prices just above the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.25</ENAMEX> level , apparently pulled back from the market on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Savaiko</ENAMEX> said he sees a possibility of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">December</ENAMEX> contract dropping to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.05</ENAMEX> a pound .
