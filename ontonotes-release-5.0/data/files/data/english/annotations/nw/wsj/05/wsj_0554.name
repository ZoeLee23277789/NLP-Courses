<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy -AMP- Mather</ENAMEX> , whose declining profitability prompted its takeover by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WPP Group</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> , will see its profit margins bounce back to the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.5 %</ENAMEX> range '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Phillips</ENAMEX> , the agency 's new chairman - elect .
The ad agency 's pretax profit margins were slightly under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> at the time of the takeover , according to analysts ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> - based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WPP</ENAMEX> 's goal is to increase margins to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> made his comments during an interview detailing his plans for the agency .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> - born , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">24 - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> veteran was named <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> to succeed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Roman</ENAMEX> , who is leaving by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year 's end</ENAMEX> to take a top post at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> client .
Surrounded by stacks of paper , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> computers and photos of himself boating and flying , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> laid out several changes he hopes to make at the agency .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> and foremost , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> said he hopes to improve client service .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> under the fastidious Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> gained a reputation as occasionally being high - handed in its treatment of clients , of preaching what strategy a client should -- indeed , must -- follow .
And some of its top client - service executives , including Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> , were promoted to the point they were saddled with administrative duties , with little time to see clients .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> recently freed himself up to spend more time with clients by delegating much of his administrative work to a deputy .
He also plans to get to know clients that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> was closer to , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lever Brothers</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seagram</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> men are planning joint visits to a number of clients to attempt to smoothly hand over the reins .
`` Clients want to see more of our senior people involved in the business -- not once a month , but <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two or three</ENAMEX> times a week , '' he said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> also hopes to finally implement a reorganization announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</ENAMEX> but put on hold by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WPP</ENAMEX> takeover .
The reorganization is supposed to make one - stop shopping -- buying advertising , public relations and design all in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> place , or `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> Orchestration '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">Ogilvyspeak</ENAMEX> -- a reality .
Under the reorganization , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> plans to name <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> executive on each account as a `` client service director '' to work as the client 's single contact for all those services .
`` There is little or no integration of our work , quality is spotty , there is no single focus , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> complained to staffers in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">March</ENAMEX> , when the reorganization was announced .
Now Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> says he hopes to have the new system in place for several clients -- including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Express</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ryder</ENAMEX> -- by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year 's end</ENAMEX> .
Industry executives and analysts are divided on whether Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> is up to the task .
He is n't as well - known to clients as is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> .
Under his watch , office politicking was often rampant in the agency 's <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> operation and the office there has had a dismal new - business record for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">more than a year</ENAMEX> .
And while <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> the agency hired a top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chiat / Day / Mojo</ENAMEX> executive , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Hamilton</ENAMEX> , to try to bolster its work , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> has to get the revenue of that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> office moving , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Dougherty</ENAMEX> , an analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">County NatWest Securities</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> clearly does have going for him is continuity , although it is n't certain if that will be enough .
As Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dougherty</ENAMEX> says , `` The last thing they need is enormous disruption at the top ... and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham</ENAMEX> is obviously a long - term member of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ogilvy Mafia</ENAMEX> , as we call it . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> and Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> are indeed quite similar in substance , if not in style .
While Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> is a workaholic detailsman , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> would rather delegate , leaving him time for his interests outside the office .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roman</ENAMEX> , by contrast , seems rarely to cut loose at all , although he did appear at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Halloween</ENAMEX> party <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> decked out in duck feet and a duck hat , costumed as a `` lame duck . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phillips</ENAMEX> said the company 's expected margin improvement will be all but inevitable , given that the company 's profitability was dragged down <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> by an expensive move to luxurious , oversized new <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> headquarters .
The move , budgeted at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 7 million</ENAMEX> , actually came in at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 10 million</ENAMEX> , he said .
But margins will be helped , too , by some other cost - saving steps .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> eliminated the mail room staff , closed the executive dining room and , after the takeover , let go <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half a dozen</ENAMEX> financial executives .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WPP</ENAMEX> , which assumes financial control of its businesses in a hands - on way , instituted a new financial system and plans to sublet some floors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy</ENAMEX> 's new headquarters building to outsiders .
The fact that the agency will now be part of a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.K.</ENAMEX> company , under <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> accounting rules , will also make the profit picture look better .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Y-AMP-R</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> Steps Down
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Klein</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Young -AMP- Rubicam 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> office , stepped down `` temporarily '' in the wake of charges by a federal grand jury in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Haven</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , that he , the agency and another top executive bribed <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jamaican</ENAMEX> tourist officials to win its account in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
In an internal memo , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alex Kroll</ENAMEX> , the agency 's chairman , said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> decided to remove himself to minimize `` negative reaction '' from prospective clients and others and to prepare for his defense .
`` The fact that he is in the process of defending himself against the present charges could conceivably have an adverse impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Y-AMP-R</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kroll</ENAMEX> wrote .
He said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> will return to his post at the end of the trial `` at which he will be vindicated . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> will work with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kroll</ENAMEX> on some of the agency 's joint venture activities and acquisitions while the case is pending .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Georgescu</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Y-AMP-R</ENAMEX> 's ad operations , will assume Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klein</ENAMEX> 's day - to - <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> role .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Rich 's</ENAMEX> New Partner
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells , Rich , Greene</ENAMEX> named <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl Heller</ENAMEX> as an executive vice president and creative partner in its image group , which concentrates on fashion and visually oriented advertising .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">38</ENAMEX> , had headed up <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> agency <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Heller / Breene</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WCRS</ENAMEX> .
The agency , with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 35 million</ENAMEX> in billings , will be dissolved , with some of its staffers absorbed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">WCRS</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Della Femina McNamee</ENAMEX> unit in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> said .
She said it was too early to say what would happen to its clients , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Reebok</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple</ENAMEX> .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> will concentrate on accounts that include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Philip Morris 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Benson -AMP- Hedges</ENAMEX> cigarette brand , which relies on print ads , Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heller</ENAMEX> 's specialty .
As previously reported , the account is troubled , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> asking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Backer Spielvogel Bates</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ogilvy -AMP- Mather</ENAMEX> , and possibly others to try their hand at developing new creative work .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Rich</ENAMEX> declined to comment on the status of the account , as did the other agencies .
