Terms *ICH*-3 were n't disclosed *-2 for <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the plant , which *T*-1 will have annual capacity of 600,000 tons</COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">The move by <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the nation 's largest steelmaker</COREF></COREF> follows a string of earlier announcements by other major steel companies .
Bethlehem Steel Corp. , LTV Corp. and Armco Inc. all have plans *PRO* to build additional lines for such coated corrosion - resistant steel .
The surge in production , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">analysts</COREF> say 0 *?* , raises questions about capacity outpacing demand .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> note that most of the new plants will come on line in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">1992 , when the current import trade restraint program ends *T*-2</COREF> , which *T*-1 could result in more imports .
`` There 's too much capacity , '' contended *T*-1 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Charles Bradford</COREF> , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an analyst with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 there 's anyone not building one . ''
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> does add , however , that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">transplanted Japanese car makers</COREF> are <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">boosting</COREF> the levels of U.S. - made steel in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> autos , instead of *PRO*-1 relying heavily on imported steel .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">That trend</COREF> could increase demand for hot - dipped galvanized sheet .
The hot - dipped galvanized segment is one of the fastest - growing and most profitable segments of the steel market , *PRO*-1 coveted * by all major integrated steelmakers wanting *PRO* to maintain an edge over <COREF ID="40" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">smaller minimills and reconstructed mills</COREF> -- <COREF ID="40" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">those spun * off to employees</COREF> .
Indeed , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">USX</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> expects the market for coated sheet steel to reach 12 million tons annually by <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">1992</COREF> , compared with 10.2 million tons shipped * in 1988 .
For the first eight months of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">1989</COREF> , analysts say 0 shipments of hot - dipped galvanized steel increased about 8 % from a year earlier , while overall steel shipments were up only 2.4 % .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">USX</COREF> and <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Kobe Steel</COREF></COREF> hope *PRO*-1 to reach a definitive agreement establishing <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the 50 - 50 partnership</COREF> by the end of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF> , with construction tentatively slated * for the spring of 1990 and production by <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">1992</COREF> .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">USX</COREF> already has six lines in existing plants producing hot - dipped galvanized steel , but <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> marks the first so - called greenfield plant for such production .
Moreover , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will boost by 50 % <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">USX 's</COREF> current hot - dipped capacity of 1,275,000 tons .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">The company</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't expect <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the new line 's</COREF> capacity to adversely affect <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> existing hot - dipped galvanizing lines .
Steelmakers have also been adding capacity of so - called electrogalvanized steel , which *T*-1 is another way 0 *PRO* to make coated corrosion - resistant steel *T*-2 .
One of the advantages of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the hot - dipped process</COREF> is that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> allows the steel to be covered *-1 with a thicker coat of zinc more quickly .
