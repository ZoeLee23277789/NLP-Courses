New orders for durable goods fell back slightly in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">September</COREF> after *PRO*-1 shooting up <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the month before</COREF> , *PRO*-1 reflecting weakening auto demand after a spurt of orders for new 1990 models , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the Commerce Department</COREF> <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">reported</COREF> 0 *T*-2 .
Orders for military equipment , household appliances , machinery and other goods expected * to last at least three years dipped 0.1 % last month , to $ 126.68 billion *U* , after *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">leaping</COREF> 3.9 % in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">August</COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the department</COREF> said 0 *T*-2 .
Most analysts had expected a sharper decline after <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the steep rise in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">August</COREF></COREF> .
Moreover , a recent government report showing widespread layoffs in <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">manufacturing</COREF> had contributed to perceptions that <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the manufacturing sector of the economy</COREF> had slowed to a crawl .
But many economists pointed to <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">a 1.8 % <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">September</COREF> rise in orders outside <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the volatile transportation category</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> `` suggests 0 <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the manufacturing sector</COREF> is not falling apart , '' said 0 *T*-1 <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sally Kleinman</COREF> , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an economist at Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp. in <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> added , however : `` <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is not robust by any means . ''
While a decline in orders for cars and civilian airplanes pulled down <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the orders total</COREF> , an enormous jump in orders for heavy military equipment propped <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up .
Orders for capital defense goods skyrocketed 56 % , and a government analyst said 0 nearly all areas *ICH*-2 saw increases , including airplanes , missiles , ships , tanks and communications equipment .
Orders for military goods usually catapult in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">September</COREF> , government officials say 0 *?* , as <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon</COREF> scrambles *PRO*-2 to spend <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> money before the new fiscal year begins Oct. 1 .
While all the numbers in <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the durable goods report</COREF> were <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">adjusted</COREF> *-1 for seasonal fluctuations , a <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Commerce Department</COREF> analyst said that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the adjustment</COREF> probably did n't factor out all of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the wide - ranging surge in defense orders</COREF> .
Without <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the increase in defense bookings</COREF> , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">September</COREF> orders would have plummeted 3.9 % .
Analysts were most unsettled *-1 by evidence 0 the backlog of orders at factories is slipping .
Unfilled orders for durable goods rose 0.4 % in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">September</COREF> , to $ 476.14 billion *U* , after *PRO*-1 declining for the first time in 2 1/2 years in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">August</COREF> .
In July unfilled orders grew 1 % .
But <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">analysts</COREF> noted that excluding <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">transportation - where what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> believe *T*-1 was a temporary surge in auto demand pushed up the figures *T*-2 -</COREF> order backlogs have <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">declined</COREF> for three months in a row .
`` <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> means 0 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">eating</COREF> into the bread that *T*-1 keeps <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> *PRO*-2 going .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is a little disturbing , '' <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Kleinman</COREF> said *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also means 0 if you have a real drop - off in orders , production will likely fall off very quickly because there is less 0 *T*-1 to keep things *PRO*-2 going . ''
Capital goods orders outside of the defense sector tumbled for the second month in a row , *PRO*-1 posting a 5.6 % drop after a 10.3 % decline .
Such steep drops in a category seen * as a barometer of business investment would customarily be grave news for the economy .
But a <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Commerce Department</COREF> analyst said that in both months orders would have risen had it not been for a drop in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">civilian aircraft bookings</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a category that *T*-1 is showing declines only after a huge surge earlier this year</COREF> .
Still , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Milton Hudson</COREF> , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">senior economic adviser at Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. in <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF></COREF> , said : `` If you look back a half - year or so the evidence *ICH*-2 was pretty good of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">affirmative strength in the capital - goods sector</COREF> .
Now at least there are question marks about <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , and without any question the pace of growth has slowed .
