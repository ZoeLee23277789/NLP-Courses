It 's a <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> crime saga worthy of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an Erle Stanley Gardner title</COREF> : <COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Case of the Purloined Palm Trees</COREF> .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Edward Carlson</COREF> awoke one morning last month *PRO*-1 to find eight holes in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> front yard where <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> prized miniature palms , called * *PRO*-3 cycads , once stood *T*-2 .
Days later , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the thieves</COREF> returned and dug out more , *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">this time</COREF> adding insult to injury .
`` <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">The second time</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *?* , `` <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> left the shovel . ''
*PRO*-2 No garden - variety crime , palm - tree rustling is sprouting up all over Southern California , *PRO*-2 bringing big bucks to <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">crooks who *T*-1 know their botany</COREF> .
Cycads , the most popular of which *T*-1 is <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the Sago Palm</COREF> , are doll - sized versions of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">California 's</COREF> famous long - necked palms , with stubby trunks and fern - like fronds .
Because <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the Sago</COREF> is relatively rare and grows only a couple of inches a year , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a pricey lawn decoration : A two - foot tall Sago can retail for $ 1,000 *U* , and taller ones often fetch $ 3,000 or more *U* .
`` Evidently , somebody has realized 0 it *EXP*-2 's easy money *PRO* to steal <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">these things</COREF> , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Loran Whitelock</COREF> , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a research associate specializing in cycads at the Los Angeles State and County Arboretum</COREF></COREF> .
Just last week , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">*PRO* would - be thieves</COREF> damaged three Sagos at <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Whitelock 's</COREF> home in the Eagle Rock section before something frightened <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> off , *PRO*-1 foiled .
`` It *EXP*-2 's hard *PRO* to think 0 someone is raping your garden , '' <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
Police suspect that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the criminals , who *T*-1 dig up <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the plants</COREF> in the dead of night ,</COREF> are selling <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to nurseries or landscapers .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">The Sago</COREF> has become a popular accent in tony new housing tracts , *PRO* apparently giving <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the rustlers</COREF> a ready market for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> filched fronds .
Thieves are going *-3 to find `` anybody who *T*-2 has enough bucks 0 *PRO* to plant <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">these things</COREF> in their front yard *T*-4 , '' says 0 *T*-5 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">William Morrissey</COREF> , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an investigator with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the police department in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Garden Grove , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Calif.</COREF> , where five such thefts have been reported *-1 in the past several weeks *T*-6</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">The department</COREF> is advising <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">residents</COREF> *PRO*-1 to plant Sagos , if <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must *?* , in the back yard and telling nurseries *PRO*-2 to be on the lookout for anyone trying *PRO* to palm one off .
But for those Californians who *T*-1 want <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">exotic gardens</COREF> out front where neighbors can appreciate <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-2 , there 's always <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Harold Smith 's</COREF> approach .
After three Sagos were stolen *-1 from <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> home in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Garden Grove</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> put <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">a big iron stake</COREF> in the ground and tied the tree to <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the stake</COREF> with <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">a chain</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 proudly .
`` And you ca n't cut <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">this chain</COREF> with bolt cutters .
