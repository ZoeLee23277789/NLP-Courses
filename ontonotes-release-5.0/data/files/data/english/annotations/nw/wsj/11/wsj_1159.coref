<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The Justice Department</COREF> scrambled *PRO*-1 to play down the significance of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> new guidelines concerning prosecutions under <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the federal racketeering law</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The guidelines</COREF> were distributed *-1 to U.S. attorneys last summer but were disclosed *-1 for the first time by press reports this week .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> discourage prosecutors , under certain circumstances , from *PRO*-1 seeking court orders seizing the assets of racketeering defendants prior to trial .
But <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">David Runkel</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Justice Department</COREF> spokesman</COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the guidelines</COREF> `` are a codification and a clarification far more than a new direction . ''
Use of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law</COREF> against white - collar defendants , as *PRO* opposed *-1 to alleged organized - crime figures , has come under attack from some defense lawyers and legal scholars .
Critics have complained that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> unfairly strips <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">defendants</COREF> of assets before a jury determines 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have committed a crime and that aggressive use of the forfeiture provisions can ruin <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">corporate defendants</COREF> or force <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> into unfavorable plea bargains .
In <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the new guidelines</COREF> , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the Justice Department</COREF> says that in *PRO* attempting *PRO*-1 to freeze disputed assets before trial , `` <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> will not seek *PRO*-2 to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant '' and `` will not seek ... *PRO*-2 to take from <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">third parties</COREF> assets legitimately transferred * to <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The guidelines</COREF> also state , `` 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">The government 's</COREF> policy is not *PRO* to seek <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the fullest forfeiture permissible under <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF></COREF> where <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">that forfeiture</COREF> would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime *T*-1 . ''
Another provision clarifies certain limits on when prosecutors may use tax - fraud charges as a basis for *PRO* bringing a racketeering case *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Runkel</COREF> declined *PRO*-1 to speculate on whether <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the guidelines</COREF> would curb racketeering prosecutions against corporate defendants .
`` The impact , if there is any , will be impossible 0 *PRO* to judge *T*-2 ahead of time because the decision whether *PRO* to use -LCB- racketeering charges -RCB- is made *-1 in individual cases '' by <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Justice Department</COREF> officials in Washington , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-3 .
In a memorandum describing <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the guidelines</COREF> , Assistant Attorney General Edward Dennis Jr. said that government efforts *PRO* to freeze defendants ' assets pending racketeering prosecutions `` have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press . ''
But <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Runkel</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is n't `` backing off on these kinds of matters at all .
