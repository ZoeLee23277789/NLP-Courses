<DOC DOCNO="nw/wsj/22/wsj_2232@2232@wsj@nw@en@on">
First , there was a death watch .
Then exhilaration .
Spurred by waves of large - scale buying in blue - chip stocks , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rallied <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> and erased <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about a half</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</ENAMEX> - point plunge , gaining <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">88.12</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2657.38</ENAMEX> .
It was the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">fourth</ENAMEX> - biggest advance for the average of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> blue chips , on frenetic <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> volume of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">416,290,000</ENAMEX> shares -- the highest since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</ENAMEX> after the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
While the advance cheered investors who feared a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> - style crash would occur <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , it was strictly a big - stock rally fed by huge buying by bargain - hunting institutions and program traders .
A troubling sign : Declining stocks on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> outnumbered advancers , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">975</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">749</ENAMEX> , and the over - the - counter market that includes many smaller stocks suffered aftershocks of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's late <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> plunge .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> OTC index closed down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.31</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">460.98</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , in a divergence in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> of the market 's most important indicators , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials ' sister average , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> - stock Dow Jones Transportation Average , tumbled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">102.06</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1304.23</ENAMEX> -- its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - worst decline next to the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">164.78</ENAMEX> - point fall during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash .
Transports plunged on takeover disappointments in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> airline stocks , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AMR</ENAMEX> , which each fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">more than 20 %</ENAMEX> when they reopened for trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> after being suspended <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> , the takeover stock at the center of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">190.58</ENAMEX> - point market plunge , fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">56 7/8</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">222 7/8</ENAMEX> on nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.3 million</ENAMEX> shares .
Overall , `` this is a pleasant rally but it 's very selective , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Cashin Jr.</ENAMEX> , a veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber Inc.</ENAMEX> trader at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> .
`` Everyone was a little concerned about the general narrowness of the rally and failure of the OTC market to get into plus territory .
It 's just a strange feeling .
I do n't think anyone left the place whistling <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Dixie</ENAMEX> . ''
The rally gave credence , at least for now , to the pre-trading declaration of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John J. Phelan Jr.</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's market debacle was `` an abnormal condition , and not a disaster . ''
But to traders , it looked like disaster on the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30 a.m.</ENAMEX> opening bell .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average opened down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.64</ENAMEX> shortly after <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">9:30</ENAMEX> .
But most of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30</ENAMEX> blue - chip stocks in the average , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastman Kodak</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">General Motors</ENAMEX> , could n't trade because of the heavy backlog of sell orders left over from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late - afternoon</ENAMEX> rout .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">9:45</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Procter -AMP- Gamble</ENAMEX> -- one of the most important <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> bellwethers of late -- opened down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 3/4</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">117</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> dropped to a quick <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> - point loss , and to many traders it looked as if stocks were headed for yet another big tumble .
More stocks opened over the ensuing <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">half hour</ENAMEX> , as the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">49</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> specialist firms in charge of keeping the market orderly groped to find buy orders from major brokerage firms to match the selling flood .
Then , to make matters worse , computerized sell programs kicked in , hammering stocks into steeper losses .
There was heavy stock - index arbitrage , as traders sold big baskets of stock and bought stock - index futures to profit from the price discrepancies between the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> markets .
This was a hangover from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Standard -AMP- Poor 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500</ENAMEX> - stock index futures had closed at a sharp discount to stocks .
The onslaught of the program selling dashed any hopes that some of the big program trading firms would hold off until the market stabilized .
They did n't .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> accelerated its slide , losing <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">63.52</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the first 40 minutes</ENAMEX> of trading .
With program traders seemingly in charge , buyers backed away from the market and watched stocks fall .
Then at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10:15</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> suddenly started to rebound , and when it shot upward it did so even faster than the <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">early - morning</ENAMEX> fall .
And this time , it was n't just the program traders who were responsible .
All the selling had pushed stocks to such cheap values that big investment banks and major money management firms started buying stocks heavily .
The program traders were in there , too , of course .
But according to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> trader , the programmers `` did n't look as dominant on the upside as on the downside because there was -LCB- also -RCB- a lot of bargain - hunting '' by institutions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland M. Machold</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New Jersey Division of Investment</ENAMEX> , which oversees <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 29 billion</ENAMEX> in investments , said the `` first thing we did was to double our orders '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> .
`` With the market down like this , we 'll probably take <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">another $ 50 million</ENAMEX> and put it in '' the market .
Trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX> particularly caught traders ' eyes .
According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> officials , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> had one of the biggest sell - order imbalances on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> ; it was one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">seven</ENAMEX> stocks that could n't finish trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">that day</ENAMEX> .
The stock opened late at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">114 1/2</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">8 1/2</ENAMEX> .
But then it shot upward <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7 1/2</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman , Sachs -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> stepped in and bought , traders said .
However , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Disney</ENAMEX> specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Fagenson</ENAMEX> said : `` I would be surprised if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Goldman</ENAMEX> represented <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</ENAMEX> of the opening volume . ''
Around Wall Street , trading desks were relieved that they could at least play the market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , in contrast to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's gridlock .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson , Lufkin -AMP- Jenrette Inc.</ENAMEX> , head equity trader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dudley Eppel</ENAMEX> said : `` I think the opening was constructive .
It was orderly .
We put some orders together .
There was n't a lot of panic selling , either domestically or internationally ... .
Not like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> where they just took -LCB- the market -RCB- apart . ''
Still , the market had n't yet crossed into positive territory , and traders were glum .
But in another dramatic burst , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> tacked on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">42</ENAMEX> points in <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">five minutes</ENAMEX> , and at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10:25</ENAMEX> the index showed a gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5.74</ENAMEX> .
On the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> floor and on trading desks , traders yelped their approval .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Grinned Griffith Peck</ENAMEX> , a trader in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. 's</ENAMEX> OTC department : `` I tell you , this market acts healthy . ''
Around him , scores of traders seemed to get a burst of energy ; their boss broke out bottles of <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Perrier</ENAMEX> water to cool them off .
Among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> specialists , the cry was `` Pull your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares .
`` It was bedlam on the upside , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> specialist .
But not everybody was making money .
The carnage on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Chicago Board Options Exchange</ENAMEX> , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> stock - index options was halted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
Many market makers in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">S-AMP-P</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> index options contract had bullish positions <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses .
Over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> , clearing firms told the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> market makers to get out of their positions at any cost <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> .
`` They were absolutely killed , slaughtered , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Chicago</ENAMEX> - based options trader .
Some traders said that the closely watched Major Market Index , whose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">20</ENAMEX> stocks mimic the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials , did n't lead <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> 's big rally .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Gallagher</ENAMEX> , a partner at specialist <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fowler -AMP- Rosenau</ENAMEX> , said , `` The difference between <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</ENAMEX> '' -- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Terrible Tuesday</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 20 , 1987</ENAMEX> -- `` is that then we needed a savior to go into the Major Market Index , spend <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 million</ENAMEX> and get the program rally started .
This time -LCB- institutions -RCB- saw the programs coming and backed away and backed away .
Then when the market was at a technical level to buy , they came in with a vengeance . ''
However , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> analyst , the timing of Major Market Index futures buying just before the turnaround was similar to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">Terrible Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
`` Futures were pulling the stock market higher , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Selkin</ENAMEX> , head of stock - index futures research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential - Bache Securities Inc</ENAMEX> .
Although <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> specialist firms struggled through another highly volatile trading session , their performance <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> was better than during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">late - afternoon</ENAMEX> chaos , according to traders and brokers who work with them .
Specialists were criticized for their inability to maintain orderly markets during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> plunge .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , even with halts in such major blue - chip stocks as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merck</ENAMEX> , `` we expected -LRB- the halts -RRB- and it was n't too bad , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Donaldson</ENAMEX> 's Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eppel</ENAMEX> , who had been critical of the specialists ' performance on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> .
According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> official , while many stocks opened late , there were subsequent trading halts in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only three</ENAMEX> issues -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AMR</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merck</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Valero Energy</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merck</ENAMEX> is one of the most important stocks in the Major Market Index .
No sector of the market has been spared during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two days '</ENAMEX> gyrations .
Yet from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dow</ENAMEX> industrials ' high on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 9</ENAMEX> through <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's plunge , relatively good performances have been turned in by real - estate , utilities , precious metals and life insurance stocks .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , the top performing industry group was oil field equipment issues .
For example , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Halliburton</ENAMEX> jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1/4</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">38</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Schlumberger</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1/2</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 1/4</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Baker Hughes</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1/8</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">22</ENAMEX> .
Because of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UAL</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AMR</ENAMEX> tumbles , airlines were the weakest sector of the market <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Philip Morris</ENAMEX> was <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> most active issue , rising <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2 1/4</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 1/4</ENAMEX> on nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight million</ENAMEX> shares .
Among other major issues , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Coca - Cola Co.</ENAMEX> closed up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">66 3/4</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.7 million</ENAMEX> shares and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">American Telephone -AMP- Telegraph</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 1/4</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43</ENAMEX> on nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7.8 million</ENAMEX> shares .
Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines</ENAMEX> , which reported earnings <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , finished at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1</ENAMEX> , after slipping below <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's session for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> time in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">five years</ENAMEX> .
Shares of three brokerage firms rose after they reported earnings .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> added <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 3/4</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">28</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PaineWebber</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/4</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">18 1/2</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bear Stearns</ENAMEX> rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/8</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14 1/4</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> , a recently hot stock , climbed <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">4</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">124</ENAMEX> on nearly <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1.6 million</ENAMEX> shares .
At a news conference after the close of trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board 's</ENAMEX> Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> and other exchange officials praised the performance of their computers and personnel .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said that program trading strategies were n't responsible for triggering <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's decline despite a jump in the use of the computer - driven strategies in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent months</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Some 24 million</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100 million</ENAMEX> shares traded in the final <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">90 minutes</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's session , when the plunge in stock prices was concentrated , were program - related , he said .
Program trades make up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> of the exchange 's volume on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">an average day</ENAMEX> , but despite the increase <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> , it was `` certainly not something you would say precipitated the market decline , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> expressed relief that the market rebounded <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
`` Obviously , every time we get this kind of reaction , it 's going to make everybody nervous , including me , '' he said .
He said that exchange officials had conversations with Wall Street firms throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> and that `` all the participants behaved very , very responsibly <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> . ''
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shearson</ENAMEX> 's head of retail equity trading , praised institutional investors in the OTC market , who were heavy buyers of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Nasdaq</ENAMEX> 's biggest technology issues <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> amid a flood of selling by other investors .
`` The institutions ca n't be criticized for their behavior , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">DaPuzzo</ENAMEX> said in an interview .
`` It was the opposite of what happened on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 19</ENAMEX> .
They used their judgment .
They did n't panic during the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> round of selling <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</ENAMEX> .
Instead , they bought on weakness and sold into the strength , which kept the market orderly .
Maybe they learned from experience . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said the performance of specialists during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's plunge was admirable , because out of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,640</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Big Board</ENAMEX> common stocks traded during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</ENAMEX> were closed and were n't reopened before the close .
`` They did an excellent job , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phelan</ENAMEX> said of the specialists .
Wall Street traders on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> had complained about the trading suspensions .
