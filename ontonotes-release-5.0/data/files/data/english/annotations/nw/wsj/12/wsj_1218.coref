Genetic Defect Spotted *-1 In <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">3 - Day - Old Embryo</COREF>
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">RESEARCHERS</COREF> diagnosed a genetic defect in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">a three - day - old mouse embryo</COREF> in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">an experiment directly applicable to humans</COREF> .
Prenatal diagnosis of genetic defects as early as the sixth week of pregnancy is increasingly common today .
But the mouse experiment at a Medical Research Council laboratory in London shows 0 genetic defects can be detected *-1 three days after conception *PRO* using <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">a new American - developed gene - copying technique</COREF> .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">The experiment , applicable to many genetic disorders ,</COREF> involved <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">beta - thalassemia</COREF> , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a severe blood anemia resulting from <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">a missing hemoglobin gene</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's an inherited human disorder that *T*-2 's been duplicated *-1 in mice .
In <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the experiment</COREF> , mice with <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the defective gene</COREF> were mated *-1 .
Three days later , before <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the new embryo</COREF> had become implanted *-2 in the uterus , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was washed *-1 out of the mother mouse .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">The embryo</COREF> had progressed only to a clump of eight identical cells .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">One cell</COREF> was teased *-1 out , and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> DNA extracted *-2 .
*PRO*-2 Using <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the new technique developed * by Cetus Corp. , called * *PRO*-4 the polymerase chain reaction ,</COREF> <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the scientists</COREF> rapidly made millions of copies of the section of DNA that *T*-1 ordinarily contains <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the hemoglobin gene</COREF> , *PRO*-2 providing enough copies 0 *PRO* to test *T*-3 .
A genetic probe showed 0 <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the hemoglobin gene</COREF> was missing , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the researchers</COREF> <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">report</COREF> 0 *T*-1 in the medical journal Lancet .
In <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the report</COREF> , two molecular biologists suggest 0 such embryo diagnosis can be used *-1 by couples at high risk of *PRO* passing a genetic defect to a child .
For example , infertile couples who *T*-1 have the woman 's eggs fertilized *-2 in the test tube usually have several eggs *ICH*-4 fertilized *-3 at a time .
When the fertilized cells divide to eight cells *T*-2 , a single cell from each embryo can be tested *-1 for genetic defects .
A healthy embryo can be picked *-1 for implantation and defective ones discarded *-2 .
Or in other couples , the embryo could be temporarily taken *-1 out and tested *-1 three days after conception and returned *-1 if *PRO*-1 healthy , or discarded *-1 if not .
Yeast Adapted *-1 *PRO* to Make Gene - Spliced Drugs
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">AN OIL COMPANY</COREF> finds a sideline in the microscopic world of yeast .
In the early 1970s , when the `` world food crisis '' was a major worry *T*-1 , <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Phillips Petroleum Co.</COREF> , like several other big companies , began *-2 developing <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">`` <COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">single - cell protein</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">edible protein made * by microbes feeding on non-edible materials</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Phillips</COREF> found and improved <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a yeast</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Pichia pastoris</COREF> , '' which *T*-1 made protein from natural gas - derived alcohol</COREF> .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also could convert glucose from farm wastes into edible protein .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Single - cell protein</COREF> never panned out , and most companies abandoned such research .
But <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Phillips</COREF> persisted , *PRO*-1 calling in scientists from the Salk Institute .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 've now adapted <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the yeast</COREF> to *PRO* making genetically engineered drugs .
Like the bacteria used * by genetic engineers , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the yeast</COREF> can take in human genes and churn out human proteins for medical use .
But the yeast genetic apparatus is more like that of animals than the bacterial genetic apparatus .
Thus , the proteins from <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the yeast</COREF> are molecularly more like human proteins than those from bacteria .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">The oil company</COREF> claims 0 <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> yeast system also is better than bacteria at high - volume production of genetically engineered drugs .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="73" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chiron Corp.</COREF> , <COREF ID="73" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an Emeryville , Calif. , biotechnology firm</COREF> ,</COREF> is seeing if <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Phillips</COREF> yeast</COREF> can be used *-1 *PRO* to make <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> genetically engineered human proteins .
*PRO* Peeking Inside Arteries From Outside the Body
*PRO* VISUALIZING BLOOD vessels without *PRO* poking catheters into the body may come out of research at <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">AT-AMP-T Bell Laboratories</COREF> .
Strokes , heart attacks , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">leg pains</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">intermittent claudication</COREF> -RRB- and other problems stem from clogging of the arteries by cholesterol - rich deposits .
At present , doctors can see how badly an artery is clogged *-1 *T*-3 only by *PRO*-4 inserting a thin catheter into the artery and injecting a fluid that *T*-2 makes the arteries visible on X-rays .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">A non-invasive method</COREF> is being researched *-1 by biophysicist Lynn Jelinski at <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the AT-AMP-T unit</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> relies on the fact that certain atoms give off detectable signals when *PRO* subjected *-1 to an intense magnetic field *T*-2 .
It 's the same phenomenon used * in the new MRI -LRB- magnetic resonance imaging -RRB- scanners being used * in hospitals in place of X-ray scans .
In the <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Bell Labs</COREF> experiments , an MRI - type of machine , synchronized * with the heartbeat via an electrocardiogram , rapidly flashes a magnetic field on and off as blood passes a certain point in a vessel .
The rapidly flashing return signals from excited hydrogen atoms in the blood give a `` *PRO* stop - motion '' movie of the blood - filled vessel , -LRB- like the `` *PRO* stop - motion '' seen *PRO* in disco dancers when a strobe light is flashing *T*-1 -RRB- .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The scientists</COREF> have experimented on the tiny neck arteries of rats .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 've been able *PRO*-1 to measure the minuscule movements of the artery wall as the beating heart raises and lowers the pressure of the flowing blood , a first for such tiny blood vessels , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> report 0 *T*-2 in <COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Nature</COREF> , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a scientific journal</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> now are experimenting with *PRO* measuring blood flow .
The ultimate hope is that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the technique</COREF> could identify diseased vessels .
Odds and Ends
TESTS ON 2,800 - year - old mummies from Chile indicate 0 ancient wood fires did n't produce dioxins or dibenzofurans , *PRO* contradicting a theory 0 the two pollutants today are coming from wood burning , General Electric Co. reports 0 *T*-1 in Environmental Science -AMP- Technology magazine ... .
Almost 40 % of schizophrenic men *ICH*-1 have an impaired sense of smell vs. fewer than 10 % of schizophrenic women , reports 0 *T*-2 the American Journal of Psychiatry .
