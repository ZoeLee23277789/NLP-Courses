<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Groupe AG 's</COREF> chairman</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the Belgian insurer</COREF> is prepared *PRO*-1 to give up some of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> independence to a white knight if *PRO* necessary *PRO*-2 to repel a raider .
Amid heavy buying of shares in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Belgium 's</COREF> largest insurer</COREF> , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Maurice Lippens</COREF> also warned in an interview that a white knight , in *PRO*-1 buying out a raider , could leave <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">speculators</COREF> with big losses on <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF> stock .
Since the beginning of <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF> , the stock has nearly doubled , *PRO* giving <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF> a market value of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">about 105 billion Belgian francs</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="44" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">$ 2.7 billion</COREF> *U* -RRB- .
The most likely white knight would be <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Societe Generale de Belgique S.A. , which *T*-2 already owns 18 % of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF> and which *T*-3 itself is controlled *-1 by <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Cie . Financiere de Suez</COREF> , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the acquisitive French financial conglomerate</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
But <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lippens</COREF> said 0 a rescue also could involve <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Asahi Mutual Life Insurance Co. , which *T*-1 owns 5 % of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF> is hardly alone in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> anxiety .
A rambunctious shake - up is quickly reshaping Europe 's once - stately insurance business .
*PRO*-2 Worried by European Community directives that *T*-1991 will remove many of the barriers to cross-border insurance services , *PRO* starting in mid-1990 , insurers are rushing *PRO*-2 to find partners and preparing for price wars .
In West Germany and the Netherlands , insurers are flirting with banks .
In <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF> , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Suez</COREF> and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Axa - Midi Assurances S.A.</COREF> both have been on the prowl for giant acquisitions ; <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Suez</COREF> last month acquired control of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Groupe Victoire</COREF> , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the sixth - largest European insurance company</COREF> , after a takeover battle with Cie . Industrielle .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lippens</COREF> said 0 the volume of shares changing hands has grown significantly since mid-September .
But <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> estimated that a raider would have been able *PRO*-1 to amass no more than 4 % of the shares in recent months .
Aside from *PRO*-1 exploring plans for joint ventures or acquisitions , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lippens</COREF> has called <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">top managers of companies rumored * as potential raiders -- among them , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Axa - Midi</COREF> , Union des Assurances de Paris and <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Suez</COREF> , all based in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have all `` very clearly stated that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have not acquired *RNR*-1 and are not acquiring *RNR*-1 shares of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *T*-3 .
Any raider would find it *EXP*-1 hard *PRO* to crack <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG 's</COREF> battlements .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">A `` syndicate '' of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">shareholders</COREF></COREF> holds just under 50 % of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF> , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lippens</COREF> said 0 *?* , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">members</COREF> have agreed *PRO*-2 to give <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">one another</COREF> the right of first refusal should <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> sell any <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF> shares .
Aside from <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Generale de Belgique</COREF> and <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Asahi</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the syndicate</COREF> includes <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Antwerpsche Hypotheekkas</COREF> , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Belgian savings bank</COREF> , and various family interests .
A <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Generale</COREF> spokesman confirmed that <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the giant Belgian holding company</COREF> would be willing *PRO*-1 to raise <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> stake in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF> should a raider seek control .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Asahi</COREF> officials could n't be reached *-1 for comment .
Even without bid talk , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">this year 's</COREF> surge in prices for <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Brussels real estate</COREF> has excited interest in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">AG</COREF> .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">The company</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">those holdings</COREF> constitute the third - biggest real - estate portfolio in <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Belgium</COREF> .
