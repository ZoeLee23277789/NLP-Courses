Your <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 2</ENAMEX> editorial `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Reding , Wrighting -AMP- Erithmatic</ENAMEX> '' on the recent `` education summit '' was like most pieces on the subject of education : It had little to say .
Oddly , though , on the very same page you printed a comment that addresses <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the most serious shortcomings of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> education system .
Unfortunately , the comment was buried in another article , so it could not stand out in an education context .
In the Manager 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Atsushi Kageyama</ENAMEX> , in commenting on many differences between <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> culture , said , `` <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> children are raised in a way many <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> would find severe .
After a wonderfully frivolous early childhood , they are exposed to rigid discipline as soon as they enter school . ''
What far too many people concerned about education either fail to understand or choose to ignore is that <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> children , on the whole , are among the most undisciplined in the world , making any attempt at improvements in the mode of education potentially unsuccessful .
Unless parents and educators alike start to develop more discipline in children , all the worthy concern , discussions and actions will not solve the problem .
