<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">General Motors Corp.</COREF> , in a series of moves that *T*-2 angered union officials in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Canada</COREF> , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the corporation</COREF> struggles *PRO*-1 to cut <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> excess vehicle - making capacity .
In announcements to workers <COREF ID="wsj_2338-E3" TYPE="IDENT">late last week</COREF> , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> effectively signed death notices for two full - sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">three U.S. car factories</COREF> .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> is under intense pressure *PRO* to close factories that *T*-1 became unprofitable as <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the giant auto maker 's</COREF> U.S. market share skidded during the past decade .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The company</COREF> , *PRO*-1 currently using about 80 % of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> North American vehicle capacity , has vowed 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 .
Just a month ago , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> announced 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood , Ga. , the eighth U.S. assembly facility 0 *T*-1 to close since 1987 .
Now , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> appears *-1 to be stepping up the pace of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> factory consolidation *PRO*-2 to get in shape for the 1990s .
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> that *T*-1 are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> can match *?* .
Another is that <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">United Auto Workers</COREF> union officials</COREF> have signaled 0 <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want tighter no - layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that *T*-2 will be <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">negotiated</COREF> *-1 next year .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> officials</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to get <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> strategy 0 *PRO* to reduce capacity and the work force *T*-2 in place before <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">those talks</COREF> begin .
The problem , however , is that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> 's moves are coming at <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">a time when <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">UAW</COREF> leaders are trying *PRO*-2 to silence dissidents who *T*-1 charge 0 <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the union</COREF> is too passive in the face of <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> layoffs *T*-3</COREF> .
Against <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">that backdrop</COREF> , <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">UAW</COREF> Vice President Stephen P. Yokich , who *T*-2 recently became head of the <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">union</COREF> 's <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> department ,</COREF> issued a statement *ICH*-1 Friday blasting <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">union</COREF> members .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">The auto maker 's</COREF> decision *PRO* to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness *PRO* to provide consistent information , '' <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Yokich</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> officials told workers <COREF ID="wsj_2338-E3" TYPE="IDENT">late last week</COREF> of the following moves : Production of full - sized vans will be consolidated *-1 into a single plant in Flint , <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mich</COREF> .
That means 0 <COREF ID="156" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">two plants</COREF> -- <COREF ID="156" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one in <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Scarborough , Ontario ,</COREF> and the other in Lordstown , <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF></COREF> -- probably will be <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">shut</COREF> *-1 down after the end of 1991 .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">The shutdowns</COREF> will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Ohio</COREF> .
<COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Robert White</COREF> , <COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Canadian Auto Workers union president</COREF> , used the impending <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Scarborough</COREF> shutdown *PRO*-1 to criticize <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. - <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Canada</COREF> free trade agreement</COREF> and <COREF ID="186" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> champion</COREF> , <COREF ID="186" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Prime Minister Brian Mulroney</COREF> .
But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> move that *T*-1 affects <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">three U.S. car plants</COREF> and <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">one in <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">Quebec</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">Workers at <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">plants in <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">Van Nuys , Calif.</COREF> , <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">Oklahoma City</COREF> and Pontiac , <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Mich.</COREF></COREF></COREF> , were told *-1 0 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> facilities</COREF> are no longer being considered *-2 to build the next generation of the <COREF ID="282" TYPE="IDENT">Pontiac</COREF> Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars .
<COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> is studying whether <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can build the new Camaro - Firebird profitably at <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">a plant in St. Therese , <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">Quebec</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">company</COREF> and <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">union</COREF> officials <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">said</COREF> 0 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">That announcement</COREF> left <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">union</COREF> officials in <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">Van Nuys</COREF> and <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">Oklahoma City</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-1 uncertain about <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> futures .
<COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">Van Nuys</COREF> plant , which *T*-1 employs about 3,000 workers ,</COREF> does n't have a product 0 *PRO* to build *T*-2 after 1993 .
<COREF ID="241" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jerry Shrieves</COREF> , <COREF ID="241" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">UAW</COREF> local president</COREF> , said 0 <COREF ID="243" TYPE="IDENT">the facility</COREF> was asked *-2 *PRO*-3 to draw up plans *PRO* to continue *-4 working as a `` flex plant , '' which *T*-1 could build several different types of products on short notice *PRO*-5 to satisfy demand .
At <COREF ID="267" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">Oklahoma City</COREF> plant , which *T*-1 employs about 6,000 workers building the eight - year - old A - body mid-sized cars ,</COREF> <COREF ID="274" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT">Steve Featherston</COREF> , <COREF ID="265" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">UAW</COREF> local vice president</COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="267" TYPE="IDENT">the plant</COREF> has no new product lined *-3 up , and `` 0 none of <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> knows '' when the A - body cars will die *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="274" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="274" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> believes 0 <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> has plans *PRO* to keep *-1 building A - body cars into the mid-1990s .
At <COREF ID="282" TYPE="IDENT">Pontiac</COREF> , however , the Camaro - Firebird decision appears *-1 to erase <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E1" TYPE="IDENT">UAW</COREF> hopes that <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> would reopen <COREF ID="291" TYPE="IDENT">the shuttered assembly plant that *T*-2 last built the plastic - bodied , two - seater <COREF ID="282" TYPE="IDENT">Pontiac</COREF> <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Fiero</COREF> model</COREF> .
<COREF ID="291" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Fiero</COREF> plant</COREF> was viewed *-3 as a model of union - management cooperation at <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF> before slow sales of <COREF ID="wsj_2338.sgm-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the Fiero</COREF> forced <COREF ID="0" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> *PRO*-4 to close <COREF ID="291" TYPE="IDENT">the factory</COREF> last year .
