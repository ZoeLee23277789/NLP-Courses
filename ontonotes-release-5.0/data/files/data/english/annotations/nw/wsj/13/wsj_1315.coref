<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">`` Hacksaw '' and `` Bonecrusher ''</COREF> are the sort of nicknames normally associated * with linebackers and heavyweight contenders .
Who 'd *T*-1 have thought that the next group of tough guys carrying around reputations like <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would be school superintendents ?
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Chicago 's</COREF> new school chief is <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the hard - nosed Ted Kimbrough</COREF> .
At <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> old job in Compton , Calif. , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took a bitter teachers ' strike and nearly came to blows with a school - board member .
At <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Chicago</COREF> press conference , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> berated the reporters .
In <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the new Chancellor</COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Joseph Fernandez</COREF> ,</COREF> has landed like a 16 - inch shell in the middle of a system that *T*-1 has been impervious to serious reform .
Both men fit <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the mood of the times</COREF> -- <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the mood</COREF> being one of a public fed up with officials ' rationalizations for why their schools do n't work *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Former Patterson , N.J. , principal Joe Clark</COREF> was no doubt the general public 's first experience with this new breed of no - nonsense administrator .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">*PRO*-1 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The subject of the movie `` *PRO* Lean on Me</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Clark</COREF></COREF> controlled <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> school with a bullhorn and a baseball bat .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> may have gone overboard in <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> pursuit of good discipline , but is n't it *EXP*-1 interesting that some of the country 's biggest , most troubled school districts are choosing new chiefs from the same gravel - chewing mold ?
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Elena Scambio</COREF> , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the woman assigned *PRO* to run the Jersey City school system that *T*-1 was taken over *-2 by the state</COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> top priority will be *PRO* to `` cut through the dead hand of bureaucracy . ''
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Fernandez</COREF> does n't take control in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> until January , but already <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's roiling the waters .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's attacked <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the concept of `` <COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">building tenure</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the most disgraceful institutions in American public schools</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> means 0 it *EXP*-1 is virtually impossible *PRO* to fire or even transfer <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">incompetent principals</COREF> .
Once <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are in the building , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stay .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">One South Bronx principal</COREF> kept <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> job for 16 years , despite a serious drinking problem and *PRO* rarely showing up for work .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was finally given leave when <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was arrested *-1 for *PRO*-3 allegedly buying crack *T*-2 .
Naturally , the principals ' union loves building tenure , and tenure has withstood previous challenge .
We suggest that <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Fernandez</COREF> find <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">an incompetent principal</COREF> , toss <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> out of the building and let <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the forces of the status quo</COREF> explain to the parents whatever it is *T*-1 0 <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're defending *T*-2 .
In <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> old job , as Dade County chief , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Fernandez</COREF> forced out 92 teachers and reshuffled 48 principals .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> cut the dropout rate by 5.5 % .
But <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the no - more - nonsense superintendents</COREF> are going *-2 to have *-3 to be judicious as well ; incompetent principals and administrators should go , but the good ones ought *-4 to be left *-1 alone .
The situation will be especially delicate for <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Kimbrough</COREF> .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> takes over a school system in the midst of radical reform .
Chicagoans have just <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">elected</COREF> <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">540 neophyte school boards , one for each school</COREF> .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> of course led to disaster in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">New York City</COREF> .
*PRO* Getting <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">a community</COREF> of parents</COREF> to care again about <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> schools is essential , but in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Chicago</COREF> <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the new boards</COREF> will make <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">mistakes</COREF> and <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Kimbrough</COREF> will have *-1 to identify <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
The rise of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">superintendents such as <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Joseph Fernandez</COREF> and <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Ted Kimbrough</COREF></COREF> suggests plainly the process of disintegration in many school systems .
The schools ' central mission , *PRO* educating children , became subsumed *-1 by <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the competing interests of bureaucrats , politicians and unions</COREF> .
The classroom itself operated on the periphery of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">this awful system</COREF> , discipline collapsed , and kids stopped *-1 learning .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Chips</COREF> was a nice fellow , and maybe <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">some day</COREF> <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll return .
Until <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">then</COREF> , it *EXP*-2 's clear that some of the people who *T*-1 've been keeping big - city schools down are going *-3 to be dealing with the Terminator .
