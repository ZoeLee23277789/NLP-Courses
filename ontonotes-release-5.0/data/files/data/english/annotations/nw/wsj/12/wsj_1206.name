Next to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 's</ENAMEX> megabillion <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR Nabisco</ENAMEX> deal , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI Television</ENAMEX> is small fry .
But the troubles of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> are a classic tale of the leveraged buy - out excesses of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> , especially the asset - stripping game .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , which expects to release a plan to restructure <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</ENAMEX> of debt in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next day</ENAMEX> or so , is n't just another LBO that went bad after piling on debt -- though it did do that .
The cable and TV station company was an LBO of an LBO , a set of assets that were leveraged twice , enabling the blue - chip buy - out king <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Kravis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> to take more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> of cash out of the com - pany .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> buy - out was an ace in the hole for Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> and for investors in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> partnerships .
But it has left holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> junk bonds holding the bag , including some heavyweights that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> might need to finance future deals , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper Financial Services</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Executive</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Columbia Savings -AMP- Loan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Prudential Insurance Co. of America</ENAMEX> .
Some junk - holders are said to be considering legal action against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> or moves to force <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> into bankruptcy court .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> 's majority partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> buy - out , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nashville</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tenn.</ENAMEX> , entrepreneur <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Gillett</ENAMEX> , also is said to be very unhappy .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> stations once were part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Storer Communications</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> loaded up the cable and television company with debt in an <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> buy - out , then later sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Storer</ENAMEX> 's cable operations at a fat profit .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> time piled debt onto <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Storer</ENAMEX> 's TV stations , selling them for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.3 billion</ENAMEX> to a new entity that was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">45 %</ENAMEX> - owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">55 %</ENAMEX> - owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gillett Corp.</ENAMEX> , which now operates the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> stations .
In this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> LBO , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> with one hand took <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">more than $ 1 billion</ENAMEX> of cash out of the TV company 's assets and moved it into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Storer</ENAMEX> cable operations , making them more valuable in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> sale .
-LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Storer</ENAMEX> also took <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 125 million</ENAMEX> of junior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> bonds as partial payment for the TV assets . -RRB-
With the other hand , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> put back into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 10 %</ENAMEX> of the cash it had taken out , buying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> common and preferred shares .
So , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> has <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated $ 250 million</ENAMEX> sunk in now - shaky <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , including equity and debt , the LBO firm still is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> ahead on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> buy - out after taking cash up front .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Storer</ENAMEX> as a whole , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> racked up compound <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> returns of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the three years</ENAMEX> it owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Storer</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> risks losing his entire equity investment of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 100 million</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> if the company ca n't be restructured .
Overall , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> 's holding company , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gillett Holdings</ENAMEX> , is heavily indebted and , except for its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vail Mountain</ENAMEX> resorts , is n't doing very well .
With the TV business falling on hard times in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , analysts say that if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> had to be liquidated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , it might fetch <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 %</ENAMEX> less than in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> buy - out , wiping out most of the company 's junk - holders and its stockholders .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> can barely pay its cash interest bill , and to stay out of bankruptcy court it must soon reschedule a lot of bank loans and junk bonds that have fallen due .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> grace period for paying its bills is due to expire <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 16</ENAMEX> .
It now is quietly circulating among creditors a preliminary plan to restructure debt .
Negotiations `` have started con - structively , but that 's not to say we like this particular offer , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilbur Ross</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rothschild Inc.</ENAMEX> , adviser to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> junk - holders .
No major player in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> deal will talk publicly .
But it 's understood that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> is disappointed that Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> did n't manage to boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> operating profit after the buy - out .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> apparently thinks <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> can survive if lenders extend its debt payments until TV stations rise in value again , allowing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> to sell assets to pay debt .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> is said to be proud of his operating record ; he has lifted some stations ' ratings and turned around a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Detroit</ENAMEX> station .
As for junk - holders , they 're discovering it can be a mistake to take the other side of a trade by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> .
The bonds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> now are being quoted at prices ranging <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">from only five cents to about 60 cents</ENAMEX> on the dollar , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">R.D. Smith -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , which trades distressed securities .
People who have seen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> restructuring plan say it offers concessions by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gillett Corp</ENAMEX> .
They would both give part of their combined <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</ENAMEX> in common equity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> to holders of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 488 million</ENAMEX> of junk bonds , as a carrot to persuade them to accept new bonds that might reduce the value of their claims on the company .
But some militant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> junk - holders say that 's not enough .
They contend that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> equity now is worthless .
They add that it is n't costing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> anything to give up equity because of its big up - front cash profit on the buy - out , which they think contributed to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV 's</ENAMEX> current problems .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Kemper</ENAMEX> , the biggest holder of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> bonds , has refused to join the bond - holders committee and is said to be reviewing its legal options .
To protect their claims , some junk - holders want <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> and perhaps Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> to invest new money in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> , perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 50 million</ENAMEX> or more .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> investment banker who is n't involved in the deal says <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> needs <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">at least $ 50 million</ENAMEX> of new equity to survive .
Junk - holders say they have a stick to beat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> with : `` The threat of bankruptcy is a legitimate tool '' to extract money from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> , says <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> big <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> holder .
This could be the first major bankruptcy - law proceeding for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> , he adds .
A big bankruptcy - court case might tarnish <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> 's name , and provide new fuel for critics of LBOs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> and elsewhere .
But others say junk - holders have nothing to gain by putting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> into bankruptcy - law proceedings .
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> does n't control <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> which is unusual for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> investment -- it clearly has much deeper pockets than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gillett</ENAMEX> .
Bankruptcy specialists say Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> set a precedent for putting new money in sour LBOs recently when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> restructured foundering <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seaman Furniture</ENAMEX> , doubling <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> 's equity stake .
But with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Seaman</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> was only trying to salvage its original investment , says bankruptcy investor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Rubin</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sass Lamle Rubin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
By contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">KKR</ENAMEX> probably has already made all the money it can on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> .
And people who know Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kravis</ENAMEX> say he is n't in a hurry to pour more money into <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SCI TV</ENAMEX> .
