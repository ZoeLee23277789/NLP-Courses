but worries about <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">1990</COREF> .
With most legislatures adjourned *-1 for the year , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">small business</COREF> is tallying <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> scorecard .
Much of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> attention was spent *-1 *PRO* fighting organized labor 's initiatives on issues 0 the small - business community traditionally opposes *T*-2 -- from *PRO* raising state minimum wage levels to *PRO* mandating benefits in health plans .
While results were mixed in many states , `` small business got by fairly well , '' concludes *T*-1 <COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Don L. Robinson</COREF> , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">associate director of <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="99" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the National Federation of Independent Business</COREF> , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the largest small - business organization</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Five states</COREF> -- <COREF ID="100" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Oregon</COREF> , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Iowa</COREF> and Wisconsin</COREF> -- passed bills 0 *T*-2 to boost the minimum wage , but measures in 19 other states were defeated *-1 .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Oregon 's</COREF> rate will rise to <COREF ID="117" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">$ 4.75 *U* an hour</COREF> , <COREF ID="117" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the nation 's highest</COREF> , in Jan. 1 , 1991 .
<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Iowa 's</COREF> will be the second highest -- at $ 4.65 *U* an hour in January 1992 -- but small - business lobbyists won an exclusion for tiny concerns and a lower training rate .
In 17 central states , one small - business count shows 0 lawmakers adopted only three of 46 bills mandating health coverage or parental leave .
The <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Illinois</COREF> Legislature narrowly passed a parental - leave bill , which Gov. James Thompson vetoed *T*-1 , and <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Iowa</COREF> and <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Tennessee</COREF> amended laws 0 *T*-2 to require that employers pay for breast - cancer exams .
Small business is bracing for an avalanche of similar proposals next year .
`` Those kinds of issues always keep *-2 coming back , '' says *T*-3 Robert Beckwith , who *T*-1 manages the Illinois Chamber of Commerce 's small - business office .
DESPITE VICTORIES <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> , small business fears *PRO*-1 losing <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">parental - leave war</COREF> .
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Only two states</COREF> -- <COREF ID="105" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Vermont and <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF></COREF> -- <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> joined five others requiring private employers *PRO*-1 to grant leaves of absence to employees with newborn or adopted infants .
Similar proposals were defeated *-1 in at least 15 other states .
But small business , which *T*-1 generally detests government - mandated benefits , has taken note of the growing number of close votes .
`` It 's just a matter of time before the tide turns , '' says *T*-1 one Midwestern lobbyist .
Consequently , small business is taking more `` pro-active '' steps 0 *T*-1 to counter mandated leaves .
In <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Pennsylvania</COREF> , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">small businesses</COREF> are pushing for a voluntary alternative ; <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> favor a commission that *T*-1 would develop sample leave policies that employers could adopt *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also support a tax credit for employers 0 *T*-2 to offset the cost of *PRO* hiring and training workers who *T*-1 temporarily replace employees on parental leave .
In <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">1990</COREF> , <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> is expected *-1 to be especially close in Alaska , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> , Michigan , New York , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Pennsylvania</COREF> and <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Illinois</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll be playing a lot of defense , especially in the Midwest and Northeast , '' says *T*-1 Jim Buente of <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the NFIB</COREF> .
IN <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">LOS ANGELES</COREF> , more small businesses ponder *PRO*-1 adopting <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">a child - care policy</COREF> .
Triggering the re-examination is *T*-1 a recent city council decision *PRO* to give <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">preference in *PRO* letting city contracts to suppliers with a stated policy on child care for their employees</COREF> .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">The preferential treatment</COREF> even applies to *PRO* awarding small contracts under $ 25,000 *U* and consulting and temporary services -- which *T*-1 often go to the smaller concerns .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Firms</COREF> are permitted *-1 wide flexibility in the child - care arrangements 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> provide *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Council member Joy Picus</COREF> , <COREF ID="110" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the measure 's</COREF> chief advocate</COREF> , considers <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> part of a `` pro-family policy '' that *T*-1 makes <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Los Angeles a leader in `` *PRO* humanizing the workplace</COREF> . ''
NOVEMBER BALLOTS will contain few referendum or initiative issues that *T*-1 especially affect small business .
In <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">San Francisco</COREF> , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">small businesses</COREF> are urging passage of a local initiative 0 *T*-1 to build <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">a new $ 95 million *U* downtown baseball stadium</COREF> ; <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> believe 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will spur retail sales and hotel - restaurant business .
But in <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Washington state</COREF> , small business generally opposes an initiative 0 *T*-2 to boost spending on children 's programs by $ 360 million *U* , *PRO*-3 fearing 0 <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> 7.8 % sales tax will be raised *-1 *PRO* to finance the outlays .
DIALING DOLLARS :
Small businesses in suburban Chicago are discovering that an area - code switch Nov. 11 -- to <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">708</COREF> from <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the familiar 312</COREF> -- wo n't be without some costs as they alter stationery , among other things , and notify customers .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="112" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Wessels -AMP- Pautsch</COREF> , <COREF ID="112" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a small St. Charles law firm</COREF> ,</COREF> plans *PRO*-1 to mail 500 customers a list of <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> lawyers ' new phone and fax numbers as well as updated Rolodex cards .
But <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">many owners</COREF> plan *PRO*-1 to practice frugality -- *PRO*-2 crossing out <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the old code</COREF> and writing in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the new one</COREF> until <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> stock runs out .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Even print - shop operator Clay Smith of Naperville</COREF> wo n't discard <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> old supply .
-LRB- <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> reports 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> business is up slightly from customers replacing old stock . -RRB-
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="115" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">CALIFORNIA</COREF> , <COREF ID="115" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">A TREND - SETTER in franchising rules</COREF> ,</COREF> stirs a controversy .
With <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">some new rules</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">state officials</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> made it *EXP*-2 easier -- and faster -- *PRO* to sell new franchises whose terms *T*-1 stray from those in state - registered contracts .
Previously , regulators insisted that franchisers <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">pre-register</COREF> such changes with <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> -- <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">a costly process taking at least six weeks</COREF> .
Now some negotiated sales that *T*-2 meet a series of tests do n't have *-3 to be pre-registered *-1 .
For instance , franchisers no longer must pre-register sales to aspiring franchisees who *T*-1 qualify as `` sophisticated purchasers . ''
Such buyers must have a minimum net worth of $ 1 million *U* , $ 200,000 *U* annual income , or recent experience in the business area of the franchise being sold * .
But critics consider <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the changes</COREF> regressive .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lewis G. Rudnick</COREF> , <COREF ID="116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Chicago lawyer who *T*-2 represents franchisers</COREF> ,</COREF> contends 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> is narrowly limiting *RNR*-1 -- rather than expanding *RNR*-1 -- opportunities for *PRO* negotiating sales .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> argues 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> regulators</COREF> historically have misinterpreted <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> law -- and <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 negotiated sales that *T*-1 are n't pre-registered have been legal all along .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">San Francisco</COREF> lawyer Timothy H. Fine , who *T*-1 represents franchisees , insists 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">California 's</COREF> cautiousness helps *PRO* protect franchisees from crafty sales negotiators who *T*-2 push unlawful clauses .
SMALL TALK :
A new Maryland law frees store owners of liability if a customer trips *RNR*-2 or otherwise gets hurt *RNR*-2 on the way to the restroom ... .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Only 4 % of Missouri small businesses surveyed *</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've tested an employee or applicant for drug or alcohol use ... .
By 52%-36 % , <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Tennessee</COREF> <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">NFIB</COREF> members favor laws 0 *T*-1 to limit foreign ownership of land and facilities in <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> .
