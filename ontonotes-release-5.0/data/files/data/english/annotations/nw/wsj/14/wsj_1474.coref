<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">High - definition television</COREF> promises *PRO*-1 to be the TV of tomorrow , so <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a natural multibillion - dollar market .
Although major U.S. manufacturers have all but ceded the main segment of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">that future business</COREF> to <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> , not everyone here is ready *PRO*-1 to give up .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">A handful of small U.S. companies</COREF> are struggling *PRO*-2 to develop the technology 0 *T*-3 to build the screens for the thin , high - quality televisions that *T*-1 are expected *-4 to hang on living room walls by the end of the 1990s .
With only small help from <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">these start - up concerns</COREF> are trying *PRO*-2 to compete with the Goliaths of the Japanese consumer electronics industry , which *T*-1 enjoy considerable backing from <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese government</COREF> .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood , Ohio ,</COREF> aims *PRO*-2 to use a new form of plasma technology *PRO*-3 to put movie - quality images on a TV display that *T*-1 is 40 inches in diameter but only a few inches thick .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Planar Systems Inc.</COREF> of Beaverton , Ore. , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the largest of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">these firms</COREF> , with $ 20 million *U* in annual revenue</COREF> ,</COREF> has similar plans .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> already has had success in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">electroluminescence</COREF> , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">another promising technology adaptable for high - definition television</COREF> .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Two other firms</COREF> , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. of Troy , Mich. ,</COREF> and <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Magnascreen Corp. of <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Pittsburgh</COREF></COREF></COREF> are developing a variation of the flat - panel screens called * *PRO*-1 active - matrix liquid crystal displays .
The new technologies are intended *-2 to retire <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the cathode - ray tube , which *T*-1 accounts for most of the bulk of the conventional TV set</COREF> .
*PRO* Replacing <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the cathode - ray tube</COREF> with a large , thin screen is the key to the creation of a high - definition television , or HDTV , which *T*-1 is expected *-2 to become a $ 30 billion *U* business world - wide within a decade .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Large U.S. companies</COREF> are interested in other segments of the HDTV business , such as signal - processing and broadcast equipment .
But except for Zenith Electronics Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. , which *T*-1 is collaborating with <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Toshiba</COREF> on computer displays , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are poorly positioned *PRO*-2 to exploit advances in <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">large panels</COREF> .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">General Electric Co.</COREF> recently sold off <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> interests in liquid - crystal displays to Thompson - CSF of France .
`` <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> found <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> not developing as <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would *?* , '' a <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">GE</COREF> spokesman says *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The small U.S. firms</COREF> are persisting because of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> strong positions in patents , and because the prize is still there *PRO* to be seized *-1 .
`` No one yet has <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">shown</COREF> the ability *PRO* to manufacture <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">these panels</COREF> '' at commercial costs , says 0 *T*-1 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Zvi Yaniv</COREF> , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the president of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Ovonic Imaging</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks 0 <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> company</COREF> is just a few years from *PRO*-1 doing <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
<COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">The Bush administration</COREF> , hearing conflicting advice about what <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> role in HDTV should be *T*-1 , is n't doing much for now .
The only material support 0 <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is extending *T*-1 to <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the struggling U.S. industry</COREF> is <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">$ 30 million *U* in awards from <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon 's</COREF> Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">DARPA</COREF> funds</COREF> are a pittance compared with what <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> and other prospective competitors are spending *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">The Commerce Department</COREF> estimates that Japanese government and industry spending on HDTV research is already over $ 1 billion *U* .
`` Unless <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> gets more help , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. industry</COREF> wo n't have a chance , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Peter Friedman</COREF> , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Photonics 's</COREF> executive vice president</COREF> .
Thus far , almost all of the basic technology relating to high - definition television has come from U.S. laboratories .
But <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="69" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Peter Brody</COREF> , <COREF ID="69" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Magnascreen 's</COREF> president</COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese companies</COREF> are poised *PRO*-1 to snatch <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the technology</COREF> and put <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to commercial use , just as <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did with earlier U.S. innovations in color television and video recording .
In the 1970s , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Brody</COREF> helped *PRO* <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">develop</COREF> <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the first display panels based * on active - matrix liquid crystals</COREF> at <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Westinghouse Electric Corp. 's</COREF> research labs in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Pittsburgh</COREF> .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">The panels</COREF> are like oversized semiconductors surfaced * with a million or more picture elements , each contributing to the color and tone of a TV image .
In 1979 , however , <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Westinghouse</COREF> abandoned <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the project</COREF> along with <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> stake in advanced television .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Brody</COREF> left <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> *PRO*-1 to find other backers .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has a claim to the right *PRO* to commercialize <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Westinghouse</COREF> patents</COREF> , but <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> contends that <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">those patents</COREF> are being infringed *-1 by a number of Japanese producers .
`` <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Most American investors</COREF> have just given up , '' <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Brody</COREF> says *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are n't prepared *PRO*-1 to compete in an area where the Japanese want *PRO*-3 to enter *T*-2 . ''
Many critics question <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the industry 's</COREF> need for federal support ; <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon</COREF> justifies <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> help on national - security grounds .
`` <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do n't see a domestic source for some of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> -LCB- HDTV -RCB- requirements , and that 's a source of concern , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Michael Kelly</COREF> , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">DARPA 's</COREF> defense manufacturing office</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">DARPA</COREF> is trying *PRO*-1 to keep <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> *PRO*-2 interested in *PRO* developing large display panels by *PRO*-1 doling out research funds .
HDTV already has some military applications , such as *PRO* creating realistic flight simulations and transmitting information to combat commanders .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">The Navy</COREF> is ordering displays for <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Aegis cruisers and <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the Army</COREF> wants smaller versions for <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Abrams battle tanks .
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">The Commerce Department</COREF> also is trying *PRO*-2 to encourage <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">HDTV</COREF> because of the benefits that *T*-1 could spin off to the semiconductor and computer industries .
`` <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is n't just yuppie television , '' argues *T*-1 <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jack Clifford</COREF> , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the department 's</COREF> office of microelectronics and instrumentation</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">The industry</COREF> will create industrial products such as displays for work stations and medical diagnostic equipment before <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> acquires a mass consumer market . ''
Although some HDTV advocates are calling for other forms of aid , such as antitrust relief for research consortia , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the small firms</COREF> simply would prefer more <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">DARPA</COREF> funds .
Each claims *PRO*-1 to possess <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the right technology</COREF> and wants just a bit more money *PRO*-1 to make <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> commercial .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also want U.S. trade policy to reflect the <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Pentagon</COREF> and <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">Commerce department</COREF> 's concern over <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> future .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">They all</COREF> are strongly opposed to a petition *ICH*-2 from several Japanese TV manufacturers , including Matsushita , Hitachi , and <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Toshiba</COREF> , *PRO* to exempt portable color TVs with liquid - crystal displays from anti-dumping duties that <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> imposes *T*-1 on the larger Japanese color TVs .
And <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> to help <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 sell overseas .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Planar</COREF> President James Hurd</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has *-1 to pay tariffs as high as 15 % *PRO*-1 to sell <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> display panels in <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> and South Korea</COREF> , while panels from <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">those countries</COREF> enter <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> *PRO*-2 duty - free .
`` This is n't a technology issue , but an attitude issue , '' <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> just have n't learned what it takes *T*-1 *PRO* to compete .
