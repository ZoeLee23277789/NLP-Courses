As a money manager and a grass - roots environmentalist , I was very disappointed to read in the premiere issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Garbage</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> uses <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">220,000 metric tons</ENAMEX> of newsprint <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> , but that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 1.4 %</ENAMEX> of it comes from recycled paper .
By contrast , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Los Angeles Times</ENAMEX> , for example , uses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">83 %</ENAMEX> recycled paper .
With newspapers being the largest single component of solid waste in our landfills , and with our country overflowing with trash , all sectors of our society and all types of businesses must become more responsible in our use and disposal of precious natural resources .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> is an excellent publication that I enjoy reading -LRB- and must read -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> .
Please make me and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of other readers more comfortable with our <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">daily</ENAMEX> purchase of your newspaper by raising your environmental standards to your overall impeccable quality levels , and increase your use of recycled paper .
