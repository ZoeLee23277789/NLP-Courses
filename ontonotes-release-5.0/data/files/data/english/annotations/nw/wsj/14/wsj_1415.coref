<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">A bill that *T*-1 would permit <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the Securities and Exchange Commission</COREF> *PRO*-3 to monitor the financial condition of securities firms ' holding companies</COREF> is facing tough opposition from some <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street</COREF> firms , which *T*-2 argue that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the legislation</COREF> is unnecessary .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">The legislation</COREF> and other issues related * to the stock market will be the focus of hearings <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">this week</COREF> by <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</COREF> and <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate Securities Subcommittee</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Richard Breeden</COREF> , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the new chairman of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> has n't taken a formal position on <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the bill</COREF> , which *T*-1 would also require investors *PRO*-2 to disclose large trades and give <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF> additional authority during market emergencies .
However , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> recently told the Senate Banking Committee that <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> believes 0 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the agency</COREF> should have explicit authority *PRO*-2 to monitor debt levels at holding companies and affiliates of broker - dealers , which *T*-1 are frequently used *-3 *PRO* to issue <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">bridge loans</COREF> .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">The bridge loans</COREF> are intended *PRO*-1 to provide temporary financing for acquisitions .
Since such loans are often refinanced through the sale of high - risk , high - yield junk bonds , the recent woes of the junk - bond market have renewed concerns among regulators about the risks associated * with <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street</COREF> firms issuing bridge loans .
But some <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street</COREF> executives argue that such fears are unwarranted .
In a July 6 letter to <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate Securities Subcommittee</COREF> , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">First Boston Corp.</COREF> argued that the fact that no retail brokerage firm failed during the 1987 market crash demonstrates that current rules are adequate .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">First Boston , <COREF ID="25" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">whose holding company</COREF> , <COREF ID="25" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">CS First Boston Group</COREF> , *T*-1 is one of the larger issuers of bridge loans on <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street</COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is also concerned that once <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF> has the power *PRO*-2 to monitor <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">holding companies</COREF> , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will try *PRO*-3 to regulate <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> activities .
`` <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">The proposal , while well - intended</COREF> , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 *T*-4 can be dangerously misleading because the likely consequence would be *PRO*-3 to weaken *RNR*-1 , rather than strengthen *RNR*-1 the control 0 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF> has exercised *T*-2 for 50 years over the financial adequacy and viability of broker - dealers , '' <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Michael Raoul - Duval</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">managing director of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">First Boston</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> said *T*-4 in an interview .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">The bill</COREF> would `` divert scarce resources of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the commission</COREF> away from broker - dealers into areas which *T*-1 simply have no way of *PRO* affecting broker - dealers , '' <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Raoul - Duval</COREF> said 0 *T*-2 .
Sources in <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> and on Capitol Hill say 0 a compromise that *T*-1 would placate <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> while *PRO*-2 addressing <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC 's</COREF> concerns may be possible .
An aide to <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate Securities Subcommittee</COREF> says 0 some legislators support the concept of risk disclosure , but adds : `` nobody is wedded *-1 to the language in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the bill</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Edward O'Brien</COREF> , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Securities Industry Association</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> said that <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the securities - industry trade group</COREF> opposes <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the bill as it is written *-1</COREF> but that <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is `` hopeful 0 a compromise can be reached *-2 *PRO* to achieve <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC 's</COREF> goals . ''
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. O'Brien</COREF> will elaborate on <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the SIA 's</COREF> position in testimony before <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee</COREF> <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">this week</COREF> , a spokesman said 0 *T*-1 .
