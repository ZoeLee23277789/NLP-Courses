Beauty Takes Backseat To Safety on Bridges
EVERYONE AGREES that most of the nation 's old bridges need *-1 to be repaired or replaced *-13 .
But there 's disagreement over how *PRO* to do it *T*-1 .
Highway officials insist 0 the ornamental railings on <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">older bridges</COREF> are n't strong enough *PRO* to prevent vehicles from *PRO* crashing through .
But other people do n't want *PRO*-1 to lose <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the bridges '</COREF> beautiful , sometimes historic , features .
`` The primary purpose of a railing is *PRO* to contain a vehicle and not to provide a scenic view , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jack White</COREF> , <COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a planner with the Indiana Highway Department</COREF> .
He and others prefer *PRO*-1 to install railings such as <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="72" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the `` type F safety shape</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="72" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a four - foot - high concrete slab with no openings</COREF></COREF> .
In Richmond , Ind. , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the type F railing</COREF> is being used *-1 *PRO* to replace arched openings on <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the G Street Bridge</COREF> .
Garret Boone , who *T*-11 teaches art at Earlham College , calls <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the new structure</COREF> *PRO*-12 `` just an ugly bridge '' and one that *T*-1 blocks the view of a new park below .
In Hartford , Conn. , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the Charter Oak Bridge</COREF> will soon be replaced *-14 , the cast - iron medallions from <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> railings relegated to a park .
Compromises are possible .
Citizens in Peninsula , Ohio , *PRO*-1 upset over changes to <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">a bridge</COREF> , negotiated a deal : The bottom half of the railing will be <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">type F</COREF> , while the top half will have <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the old bridge 's</COREF> floral pattern .
Similarly , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">highway engineers</COREF> agreed *PRO*-1 to keep the old railings on the Key Bridge in Washington , D.C. , as long as <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could install a crash barrier between the sidewalk and the road .
Tray Bon ?
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Drink Carrier</COREF> Competes With Cartons
*PRO* PORTING POTABLES just got easier , or so claims <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Scypher Corp.</COREF> , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the maker of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the Cup - Tote</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">The Chicago company 's</COREF> beverage carrier</COREF> , *PRO*-1 meant *PRO*-2 to replace cardboard trays at concession stands and fast - food outlets , resembles the plastic loops used * on six - packs of beer , only the loops hang from a web of strings .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">The new carrier</COREF> can tote as many as four cups at once .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Inventor Claire Marvin</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> design virtually eliminates spilling .
Lids are n't even needed *-1 .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also claims 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the carrier</COREF> costs less and takes up less space than most paper carriers .
A few fast - food outlets are giving <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> a try .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">The company</COREF> acknowledges some problems .
A driver has *-1 to find something 0 *PRO* to hang <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the carrier</COREF> on *T*-2 , so <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> supplies a window hook .
While <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> breaks down in prolonged sunlight , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is n't recyclable .
And unlike some trays , there 's no place for food .
Spirit of Perestroika Touches Design World
AN EXCHANGE of U.S. and Soviet designers promises change on both sides .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">An exhibition of American design and architecture</COREF> opened in September in <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">Moscow</COREF> and will travel to eight other Soviet cities .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">The show</COREF> runs the gamut , from a blender to chairs to a model of the Citicorp building .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">The event</COREF> continues into next year and includes an exchange program *PRO* to swap design teachers at <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Carnegie - Mellon</COREF> and Leningrad 's Mutchin Institute .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Dan Droz</COREF> , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">leader of <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Carnegie - Mellon</COREF> group</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> sees benefits all around .
The Soviets , who *T*-12 normally have few clients other than the state , will get `` exposure to a market system , '' <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *T*-1 .
Americans will learn more about *PRO* making products for the Soviets .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Droz</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviets</COREF> could even help <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. designers</COREF> renew <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sense of purpose .
`` In <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">Moscow</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> kept *-5 asking <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> things like , ` Why do <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> make 15 different corkscrews , when all 0 <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> need *T*-3 is one good one *T*-4 *T*-2 ? ' '' <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> got <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> thinking 0 maybe <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> should be helping U.S. companies improve existing products rather than *PRO*-1 always developing new ones . ''
Seed for Jail Solution Fails *-1 to Take Root
IT 'S A TWO BIRDS with one stone deal : <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Eggers Group</COREF> architects propose *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">using</COREF> grain elevators *PRO*-1 to house prisoners .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> would ease jail overcrowding while *PRO*-1 preserving historic structures , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> says 0 *T*-2 .
But <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> state , which *T*-13 is seeking solutions to its prison cell shortage ,</COREF> says `` no . ''
Grain elevators built * in the 1920s and '30s have six - inch concrete walls and a tubular shape that *T*-1 would easily contain semicircular cells with a control point in the middle , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> firm</COREF> says 0 *T*-2 .
Many are far enough from residential areas *PRO* to pass public muster , yet close enough *PRO* to permit family visits .
Besides , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Eggers</COREF> says 0 *?* , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">grain elevators</COREF> are worth *PRO* preserving for aesthetic reasons -- one famed architect compared <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to the pyramids of Egypt .
A number of cities -- including Minneapolis , Philadelphia and Houston -- have vacant grain elevators , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Eggers</COREF> says 0 *T*-1 .
A medium - sized one in Brooklyn , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> says 0 *?* , could be altered *-2 *PRO*-3 to house up to 1,000 inmates at a lower cost than *PRO* building a new prison in upstate New York .
A spokesman for <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> , however , calls <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the idea</COREF> *PRO*-1 `` not effective or cost efficient .
