Medieval philosophers used *-1 to hold the sensible belief that it *EXP*-3 was more perfect *ICH*-2 *PRO* to exist than *PRO* not to exist , and that *PRO* to exist as a matter of necessity was most perfect of all .
Now , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">only God</COREF> <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">exists</COREF> as a matter of absolute necessity ; <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is built *-1 into <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> nature .
But since the time of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Darwin</COREF> , <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">we humans</COREF> could at least claim a sort of natural necessity for the existence of <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> species .
Are n't <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> , after all , the inevitable culmination of that stately pageant called * *PRO*-1 evolution ?
If mutation and natural selection slowly but surely give rise to more and more advanced forms of life , then it <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> only a matter of eons before splendid beings endowed * with reason , self - awareness and taste shimmered onto the scene .
Now along comes *T*-1 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Stephen Jay Gould</COREF> *PRO*-2 to <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">dash</COREF> <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">this flattering illusion</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> credentials are excellent for <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the task</COREF> .
*PRO*-1 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Star lecturer at Harvard , author of numerous popular books on science , and scourge of the creationist lobby ,</COREF> <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gould</COREF> is perhaps <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the world 's</COREF> most eminent evolutionary theorist .
Yet <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> puts quite a twist on the old story handed * down from <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Darwin</COREF> .
For <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">natural history</COREF> is anything but a gradual , predictable march from primordial slime to human consciousness ; <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a careening , chaotic affair in which the emergence of a featherless biped was a one - in - a - million shot *T*-1 .
In <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">`` Wonderful Life : The Burgess Shale and the Nature of History '' -LRB- Norton , 326 pages , $ 19.95 *U* -RRB-</COREF> , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gould</COREF> makes <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> case for `` the awesome improbability of human evolution</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">The argument</COREF> turns on the discovery in 1909 of <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">an amazing fossil quarry high in the Canadian Rockies called * *PRO*-1 the Burgess Shale</COREF> .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Here</COREF> , in an area smaller than a city block , lay *PRO*-5 buried *-6 <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">traces of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">countless weird creatures that *T*-4 had frolicked more than 500 million years ago</COREF> -- <COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">creatures whose anatomical variety *T*-2 far exceeded what *T*-3 can be found *-1 in all <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the world 's</COREF> oceans today</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Such an embarrassment of riches</COREF> was inconceivable to <COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the man who *T*-1 discovered <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the Burgess Shale</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">one Charles Doolittle Walcott</COREF> .
The received Darwinian wisdom of the day said that animals living so long ago must be simple in design , limited in scope and ancestral to contemporary species .
Accordingly , the hidebound traditionalist reconstructed <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">hypothetical organisms</COREF> from the <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Burgess</COREF> fossils in such a way that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could be shoehorned *-1 into familiar categories .
It was not until the early 1970s that <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Cambridge Prof. Harry Whittington and two sharp graduate students</COREF> began *-2 to publish a reinterpretation of <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the Burgess Shale</COREF> .
By *PRO*-2 making clever inferences about how the squashed and distorted fossil remains corresponded to three - dimensional structures *T*-1 , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">this trio</COREF> was able *PRO*-2 to piece together <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">a series of wondrous beasties quite unlike anything currently on <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the planet</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">One</COREF> was so fantastic in appearance , 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was dubbed *-1 *PRO*-2 Hallucigenia .
*PRO* Would that <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gould 's</COREF> minute descriptions of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">these creatures</COREF> was always so colorful .
A good deal of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> *ICH*-1 is boring , particularly the endless allusions to high and pop culture and the frequent jokes festooning the text .
These turns do not provide sufficient relief from sentences like , `` Most modern chelicerates have six uniramous appendages on the prosoma . ''
Interest picks up , though , when <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gould</COREF> gets around to *PRO* discussing the meaning of the <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Burgess</COREF> oddities for the theory of evolution *T*-1 .
Not long after the appearance of life , evidently , there was an explosive proliferation in the number of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">animal designs</COREF> seen * on <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> .
The vast majority of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , however , were wiped *-2 out by a succession of environmental upheavals that *T*-1 were too sudden and catastrophic for the normal rules of natural selection to operate .
Consequently , the winnowing process was like a lottery `` in which <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">each group</COREF> -LCB- held -RCB- a ticket unrelated to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> anatomical virtues *T*-1 .
'' So much for survival of the fittest .
So much , too , for the notion that <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">we humans</COREF> triumphed in the Darwinian struggle by *PRO*-1 evolving big brains .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> mammalian forerunners</COREF> lucked out through the extraterrestrial impact that *T*-1 did in the dinosaurs because <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were small , not smart .
If anyone has difficulty *PRO*-2 imagining a world in which history went merrily on without <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gould</COREF> sketches several .
In one , birds are the dominant carnivores ; in another the seas abound with `` little penises . ''
Back when the <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Burgess</COREF> fauna were flourishing *T*-2 , it seems 0 *?* , human evolutionary hopes <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">hung</COREF> on the survival of a little worm with a backbone called * *PRO*-3 Pikaia .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gould</COREF> finds <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> oddly exhilarating ; *PRO*-1 like an existentialist of old , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> views <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> contingency as `` a source of both freedom and consequent moral responsibility . ''
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> , by contrast , can not help *PRO* feeling that if some other curiosity from <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the Burgess Shale</COREF> had survived instead , beings at once wiser and less boorish than <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Homo sapiens</COREF> might have eventually gained earthly dominion .
But even if no conscious life had evolved here at all , the universe is a big place , and given the right conditions , sympathetic to *PRO*-1 creating some form of life .
Surely at some other cosmic address a Gouldoid creature would have risen out of the ooze *PRO*-1 to explain why , *PRO* paleontologically speaking , `` it is , indeed , a wonderful life *T*-2 . ''
