Bridge and highway collapses will disrupt truck and auto transportation in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> to come .
But rail , air and ocean - shipping links to the area escaped <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's earthquake with only minor damage , and many are expected to be operating normally <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , government and corporate transport officials said .
Air traffic at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Francisco International Airport</ENAMEX> was running <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 50 %</ENAMEX> of normal <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> , but airport officals said they expect a return to full operations by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> .
The major gateway to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> and one of the nation 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">10</ENAMEX> busiest airports was closed to all but emergency traffic from the time the quake hit <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</ENAMEX> , until <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">6 a.m. PDT</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> when controllers returned to the tower .
Getting to and from the airport in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">coming weeks</ENAMEX> may be the problem , however .
`` People 's ability to drive throughout the bay area is greatly restricted , '' said a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Automobile Association</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tom Schumacher</ENAMEX> , executive vice president and general manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the California Trucking Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacremento</ENAMEX> , said his organization urged trucking firms to halt all deliveries into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay area</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , except for emergency - medical supplies .
`` Some foodstuff shipments will probably resume <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
`` Right now most of the roads into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay area</ENAMEX> are closed , but the list of closings changes about every <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">20 minutes</ENAMEX> .
This -LCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> -RCB- <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Mateo</ENAMEX> bridge was open and now we are informed that it is closed , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schumacher</ENAMEX> said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Parcel Service</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Greenwich</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Conn.</ENAMEX> , said its operations in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area have been reduced to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 %</ENAMEX> of normal .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">UPS</ENAMEX> spokesman said that although none of the company 's terminals , trucks or airplanes were damaged in the quake , road shutdowns and power failures have impeded its pickup and delivery of packages .
The spokesman noted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - hour to five - hour</ENAMEX> traffic delays on the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Mateo</ENAMEX> bridge , for example .
In addition , power failures prevented its package - sorting <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">facilities</ENAMEX> from operating , causing delays .
But freight railroads reported that damage to their <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">facilities</ENAMEX> was relatively minor , with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Santa Fe Pacific Corp. 's</ENAMEX> rail unit the least affected by the quake .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Santa Fe</ENAMEX> stopped freight trains <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> while its officials inspected track but resumed service at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">10:45 p.m.</ENAMEX> when they found no damage .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Union Pacific Corp. 's</ENAMEX> rail unit said that except for damage to shipping containers in its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> yard , its track , bridges and structures were unharmed .
That railroad is operating trains but with delays caused by employees unable to get to work .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Southern Pacific Transportation Co.</ENAMEX> , the hardest hit of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> railroads in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay area</ENAMEX> , said service on its north - south coastline , which is used by an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amtrak</ENAMEX> train between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Seattle</ENAMEX> , was suspended temporarily because of kinked rails near the epicenter of the quake .
But service on the line is expected to resume by <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
`` We had no serious damage on the railroad , '' said a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Southern Pacific</ENAMEX> spokesman .
`` We have no problem to our freight service at all expect for the fact businesses are shut down . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amtrak</ENAMEX> said it suspended train service into its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> station , which sustained `` heavy structural damage '' during the quake .
The passenger railroad said it terminated some runs in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacramento</ENAMEX> , relying on buses to ferry passengers to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay area</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Amtrak</ENAMEX> said it planned to resume some train operations to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late yesterday</ENAMEX> .
Rail - transit operations suffered little damage , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert Engelken</ENAMEX> , deputy executive director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the American Public Transit Association</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Bay Area Rapid Transit</ENAMEX> `` withstood the earthquake perfectly , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> , adding that the rail system was running a full fleet of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</ENAMEX> trains during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> to provide an alternative for highway travelers .
`` The highway system is screwed up '' by the earthquake , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Engelken</ENAMEX> said .
`` The transit system is how people are going to be getting around . ''
He added that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco 's</ENAMEX> trolley cars and trolley buses were also running at full service levels .
Although air - traffic delays in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were significant <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , they did n't appear to spread to other airports .
The earthquake shattered windows at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Francisco International 's</ENAMEX> air - traffic control tower and rained pieces of the ceiling down on controllers , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> of whom suffered minor injuries .
Terminals at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Francisco International</ENAMEX> also were damaged , but the tower itself was intact .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> were diverted to other airports and had to wait a day to resume travel .
Runways at <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were n't damaged , but traffic was being limited <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> arrivals and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">27</ENAMEX> departures an hour -- down from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">33</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">45</ENAMEX> an hour normally -- mainly because the noise level in the control tower was overwhelming without the windows , an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FAA</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said .
While the airport was closed , flights were diverted to airports in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sacramento</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Reno</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Las Vegas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Nev.</ENAMEX> ; and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United Airlines</ENAMEX> , the largest carrier at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , was operating <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">only 50 %</ENAMEX> of its scheduled service in and out of the area because of damage to its terminal , which in turn was causing delays for travelers headed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Bay area</ENAMEX> .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United</ENAMEX> spokesman said <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">21</ENAMEX> gates were unusable , mainly because of water damage caused when a sprinkler system was triggered by the tremors .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United</ENAMEX> spokesman said none of its people were injured at the airport ; in fact , as the airport was being evacuated <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> babies were born .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United</ENAMEX> ticket counter was active , with people trying to get flights out , but the airline said demand for seats into the city also was active , with people trying to get there to help family and friends .
The airports in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oakland</ENAMEX> were both fully operational by <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said .
In terms of diversions , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Denver</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Stapleton International</ENAMEX> may have experienced the most far - flung : A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">United</ENAMEX> flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> was rerouted there .
`` I think that 's the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> nonstop commercial passenger flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> to land here , '' an airport spokesman said .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Japan Air Lines</ENAMEX> spokesman said its flights into and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> were n't affected , but getting information about its operations was difficult .
Its telecommunications headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Burlingame</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , had been knocked out since the quake .
`` We 're in the dark , '' he said .
