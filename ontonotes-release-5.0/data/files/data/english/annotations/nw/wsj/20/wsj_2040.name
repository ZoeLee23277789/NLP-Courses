<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust New York Corp.</ENAMEX> became the latest major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> bank to increase reserves for its loans to less - developed countries , making a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.6 billion</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> addition to its provision .
The bank also said it expects to report a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.42 billion</ENAMEX> loss for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> and a loss for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the full year</ENAMEX> .
The new reserves bring the company 's provision for loans to Third World countries to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.6 billion</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">85 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust 's</ENAMEX> medium and long - term loans to these countries .
`` Step up to the plate and take the big swing .
Get the problem behind you and do n't look back , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James J. McDermott</ENAMEX> , analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Keefe , Bruyette -AMP- Woods</ENAMEX> , in approving of the move .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Bankers Trust</ENAMEX> `` has had the capacity to do this for some time , '' the analyst said .
He expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> to take a similar step <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> reported a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> earnings drop , which analysts called a bit disappointing , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover Corp.</ENAMEX> posted a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 789 million</ENAMEX> loss for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> after adding <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 950 million</ENAMEX> to its reserve for loans to less - developed countries .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Three</ENAMEX> other major <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> banks posted earnings increases .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> posted a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 %</ENAMEX> jump .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PNC Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> , the parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pittsburgh National Bank</ENAMEX> , reported net income climbed <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9.8 %</ENAMEX> , while net for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Banc One Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Columbus</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , grew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.8 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX>
Analysts were only slightly disappointed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> 's numbers .
`` There 's nothing in here that 's horrible and nothing to make you think they 're setting the world on fire , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carole Berger</ENAMEX> , analyst for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">C.J. Lawrence , Morgan Grenfell Inc</ENAMEX> .
Earnings from the bank 's global consumer business grew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</ENAMEX> .
`` The consumer business continues to drive the earnings stream , '' said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McDermott</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Keefe , Bruyette -AMP- Woods</ENAMEX> .
Corporate finance and trading results in member countries of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development</ENAMEX> were `` relatively flat , sometimes choppy , '' the bank said , and profit for the area sank <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 %</ENAMEX> .
The cross-border loan portfolio reflected `` adjustment problems and episodic payment patterns , '' the bank said no interest payments from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Argentina</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the nine months</ENAMEX> and none from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Brazil</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Venezuela</ENAMEX> brought itself `` substantially current . ''
Overall , the portfolio narrowed its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">quarterly</ENAMEX> loss to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 70 million</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 80 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</ENAMEX> .
`` People were waiting to see if we would take an additional provision '' for medium - term and long - term loans to less - developed countries , a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> spokesman said .
But he reiterated the bank 's position that it is comfortable with the current level of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.6 billion</ENAMEX> , covering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 30 %</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 8.9 billion</ENAMEX> of such loans outstanding .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald I. Mandle</ENAMEX> , analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sanford C. Bernstein -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> 's venture - capital gains of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 93 million</ENAMEX> before taxes `` strong . ''
A `` concerning '' item the analyst cited was the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> jump in expenses , which the bank attributes to costs of expanding both its consumer credit - card operations and its overseas branch business .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Citicorp</ENAMEX> 's spokesman said , however , that the bank is maintaining those expenses in proportion to revenue growth .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> continued to generate <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the highest profit margins among major banks , minimizing a drop in net interest margin with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> growth in high - yielding business loans and similar growth in mortgages .
Its margin fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only seven</ENAMEX> basis points , or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7/100ths</ENAMEX> of a percentage point , from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> , compared with a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> - point drop at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Security Pacific Corp.</ENAMEX> and much larger declines among banks in other parts of the country .
As a result , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo 's</ENAMEX> net interest income rose <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 36.3 million</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 537 million</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> .
Non-interest income fell slightly to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 191.9 million</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 193.3 million</ENAMEX> , while <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> continued to rigorously control non-interest expense , which was almost flat at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 393.4 million</ENAMEX> .
The combination of solid loan growth with tight expense control gave <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.25 %</ENAMEX> return on average assets for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 40 %</ENAMEX> higher than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Security Pacific 's</ENAMEX> and a profit ratio matched by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only two</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> other major banks in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo 's</ENAMEX> return on equity increased to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24.4 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23.8 %</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> has sold all of its non-trade loans made to less - developed countries , and managed to partly reverse the sharp rise in domestic non-accrual loans , which fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous quarter</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 806.8 million</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 880.9 million</ENAMEX> .
But the amount was still <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">39 %</ENAMEX> higher than the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - ago</ENAMEX> level , and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">25 %</ENAMEX> higher as a percentage of total loans .
That trend , and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo 's</ENAMEX> heavy exposure to leveraged buy - outs , are about the only worries analysts have about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo 's</ENAMEX> financial picture .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wells Fargo</ENAMEX> is rebuilding its loan - loss reserve , which increased to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 711 million</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 30</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 664 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the previous quarter</ENAMEX> but was down from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 852 million</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</ENAMEX> , when the bank still had some shaky foreign loans .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover</ENAMEX> said that excluding the addition to its reserves , certain tax benefits , and a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> - time <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 16 million</ENAMEX> gain on the sale of an interest in a foreign leasing company , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> earnings were <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 75 million</ENAMEX> .
The comparable <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year - earlier</ENAMEX> number was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 56 million</ENAMEX> , a spokesman said .
The bank 's additional provisions brought reserves for loans to less - developed countries to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.4 billion</ENAMEX> , covering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">36 %</ENAMEX> of its medium and long - term loans outstanding to these nations .
The net interest margin - the difference between the bank 's cost of funds and what it receives as interest payments -- improved in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> , as did certain areas of wholesale banking .
Fees from syndicating loans dropped <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">48 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 21 million</ENAMEX> .
`` We did n't take part in a lot of deals '' in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the quarter</ENAMEX> `` because their credit quality was poor , '' the spokesman said .
Expenses unrelated to interest rose <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.4 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 541 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PNC Financial</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">PNC Financial</ENAMEX> cited higher income from sources unrelated to interest and said it continues to cut costs .
Net interest income in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> edged up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.4 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 317.7 million</ENAMEX> .
Trust income grew <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 49.9 million</ENAMEX> , while service charges , fees and commissions increased <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">22 %</ENAMEX> , to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 79.4 million</ENAMEX> .
The bank 's total allowance for credit losses was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 502.1 million</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.82 %</ENAMEX> of total loans .
