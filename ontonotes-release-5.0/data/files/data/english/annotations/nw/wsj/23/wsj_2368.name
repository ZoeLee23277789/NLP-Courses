The only thing <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Goldberg</ENAMEX> could praise about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CBS</ENAMEX> 's new show `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Island Son</ENAMEX> '' -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Leisure -AMP- Arts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 25</ENAMEX> -RRB- was the local color ; unfortunately neither he nor the producers of the show have done their homework .
For instance : `` Haole '' -LRB- white -RRB- is not the ultimate insult ; `` Mainland haole '' is .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Chamberlain</ENAMEX> dresses as a `` Mainland haole , '' tucking in a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hawaiian</ENAMEX> shirt and rolling up its long sleeves .
And the local expression for brother is `` brah , '' not `` bruddah . ''
And even if a nurse would wear flowers in her hair while on duty , if she were engaged she would know to wear them behind her left , not right , ear .
Sorry , the show does not even have the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> redeeming quality of genuine local color .
