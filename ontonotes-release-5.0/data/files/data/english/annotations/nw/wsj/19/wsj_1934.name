A new drug to prevent the rejection of transplanted organs has been successfully used on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> patients at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> , according to researchers .
The drug , which is still in the experimental phase , has n't been approved yet by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Food and Drug Admistration</ENAMEX> , and its long - term effects are unknown .
But researchers say the drug , called FK - 506 , could revolutionize the transplantation field by reducing harmful side effects and by lowering rejection rates .
Rejection has been the major obstacle in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">approximately 30,000</ENAMEX> organ transplants performed world - wide <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">each year</ENAMEX> .
Researchers began using the drug in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February</ENAMEX> on patients who had received kidney , liver , heart and pancreas transplants .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">Only two</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111</ENAMEX> transplants have been rejected .
The drug , discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</ENAMEX> , is metabolized from soil fungus found in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> patients are the first humans to be given the drug , which is made by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujisawa Pharmaceutical Co</ENAMEX> .
`` We 're shocked by it , because it 's worked so fast , '' said Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas E. Starzl</ENAMEX> , director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Pittsburgh Transplantation Program</ENAMEX> , at a news conference here <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
`` We consider it a life - saving drug , like one for AIDS , '' said Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Fung</ENAMEX> , an immunologist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> .
Researchers say they believe FK - 506 is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100</ENAMEX> times more effective than the traditional anti-rejection drug , cyclosporine , made by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swiss</ENAMEX> pharmaceutical giant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sandoz Ltd</ENAMEX> .
They are also encouraged by the relatively mild side effects of FK - 506 , compared with cyclosporine , which can cause renal failure , morbidity , nausea and other problems .
`` The side effects -LCB- of cyclosporine -RCB- have made the penalty for its success rather high , '' Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starzl</ENAMEX> said .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fung</ENAMEX> said that FK - 506 would not be available in the market for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">at least a year</ENAMEX> , and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">FDA</ENAMEX> approval process usually takes <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three years to five years</ENAMEX> .
There are no firm plans to expand the experimental program beyond <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> , whose hospital performs the most transplants in the world .
Researchers could n't estimate the cost of the drug when it reaches the market , but they said FK - 506 will enable patients to cut hospital stays by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 %</ENAMEX> and reduce the number of blood tests used to monitor the dosage of cyclosporine and other drugs among transplant recipients .
Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starzl</ENAMEX> said the research has been largely financed by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Institute of Health</ENAMEX> and by university funds , and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fujisawa</ENAMEX> did n't give the hospital any grants .
He said that the research team had no financial stake in the drug .
`` We 've known for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">six months</ENAMEX> the effect of this drug , and our advice to our people has been not to buy the company 's stock , '' Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Starzl</ENAMEX> said , adding that profiting from FK - 506 would n't be ethical .
