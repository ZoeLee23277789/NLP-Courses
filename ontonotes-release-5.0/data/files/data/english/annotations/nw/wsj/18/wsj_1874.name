Bond prices rambled <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> as investors kept close watch on the stock market and worried about a wave of new supply .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Early yesterday</ENAMEX> , bonds rose as investors rushed to buy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> securities on the prospect that stocks would plummet in the aftermath of the massive <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
For example , some securities analysts warned that stocks of certain insurance companies , which face massive damage claims , would get hit hard .
But when the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose instead , bonds drifted lower .
With stocks not a major focus , `` we 're waiting for the next guiding light , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian J. Fabbri</ENAMEX> , chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Midland Montagu Securities Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` If the stock market tremors are behind us , then the bond market will go back to looking at the next batch of economic numbers to determine '' where interest rates are heading .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond , which jumped <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3/8</ENAMEX> point , or <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 3.75</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount , during <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the first hour</ENAMEX> of trading , ended little changed .
Interest rates barely budged from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's levels .
Most junk bonds , which have been battered in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent weeks</ENAMEX> , continued a slow recuperation and ended unchanged to slightly higher .
But some so - called high - quality junk issues fell as some mutual funds sold their most liquid issues to raise cash .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR Holdings Capital Corp. 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">14.7 %</ENAMEX> bonds due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2009</ENAMEX> fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> point .
Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RJR</ENAMEX> issues fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">between 1/2</ENAMEX> point and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1 1/2</ENAMEX> point .
In the latest sign of how difficult it is to place certain junk bonds , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental Airlines</ENAMEX> said it was forced to scale back the size of its latest offering .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental</ENAMEX> , a unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Texas Air Corp.</ENAMEX> , slashed the size of its note offering from <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 150 million</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71 million</ENAMEX> .
The move had been widely expected .
In the multipart offering , the company sold a portion of secured notes but shelved all the unsecured notes .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said the notes may be offered at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a later date</ENAMEX> .
`` This was not a do - or - die deal , '' she said .
`` I think this is a market that required some level of security .
It did not make sense to offer unsecured paper in an unsettling market . ''
Investors have been speculating for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weeks</ENAMEX> about the market 's ability to place the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 7 billion to $ 10 billion</ENAMEX> of new junk bonds scheduled to be sold by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year end</ENAMEX> .
Supply troubles were also on the minds of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> investors <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , who worried about the flood of new government securities coming <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</ENAMEX> .
`` We 're being bombarded by new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> and agency debt offerings , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Sullivan Jr.</ENAMEX> , director of money - market research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dean Witter Reynolds Inc</ENAMEX> .
`` The market is concerned about its ability to underwrite all this debt at current levels . ''
In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 15.6 billion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bills to be sold at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next week 's</ENAMEX> regular <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> auction , the government will sell <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10 billion</ENAMEX> of new <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> notes .
And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resolution Funding Corp.</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late yesterday</ENAMEX> that it will sell <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4.5 billion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bonds <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Refcorp</ENAMEX> is the financing unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resolution Trust Corp.</ENAMEX> , a new government agency created to rescue the nation 's troubled thrifts .
Its securities have been dubbed `` bailout bonds '' by traders .
In when - issued trading , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> Treasurys had a yield of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 7.88 %</ENAMEX> .
In the municipal market , all eyes were on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> debt as investors tried to gauge the financial ramifications of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's earthquake .
But traders said the quake had only a minor impact on the trading of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> state and local municipal debt .
`` There are certain bonds traders refer to as ` earthquake ' bonds because the -LRB- issuers -RRB- are on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">San Andreas</ENAMEX> fault , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zane Mann</ENAMEX> , editor of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the California Municipal Bond Advisor</ENAMEX> , a newsletter for investors .
Since those bonds already pay a slightly higher yield , an extra premium for the earthquake risk , they were n't materially affected .
But some bond market analysts said that could quickly change if property casualty insurance companies scramble to sell portions of their municipal portfolios to raise cash to pay damage claims .
`` Insurance companies will foot a substantial amount of the bill to reconstruct <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lieberman</ENAMEX> , chief economist at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Manufacturers Hanover Securities Corp</ENAMEX> .
He also expects the performance of municipals to lag Treasurys as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> is forced to issue new debt over time to repair public facilities .
A report issued <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late yesterday</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Standard -AMP- Poor 's Corp.</ENAMEX> concluded the quake wo n't cause `` wide - scale credit deterioration '' for issuers and debt issues in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">12</ENAMEX> - county area of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern California</ENAMEX> affected by the quake .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> Securities
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds ended narrowly mixed in quiet trading .
The benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond ended at a price of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 29/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.03 %</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">100 28/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.04 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
The latest <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">10 - year</ENAMEX> notes were quoted late at a price of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 26/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8 %</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99 25/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">8.01 %</ENAMEX> .
Short - term rates were little changed .
Corporate Issues
Investment - grade corporate bonds ended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</ENAMEX> point lower .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Continental</ENAMEX> junk bond offering , underwritten by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.</ENAMEX> , was the only new issue priced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
In the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> - part offering , the <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 71 million</ENAMEX> of secured equipment certificates was priced to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13.75 % to 15.75 %</ENAMEX> .
Municipals
Municipal bonds ended <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about 1/8 to 3/8</ENAMEX> point lower , hurt by the circulation of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> `` bid - wanted '' lists totaling <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 655 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Chemical Securities Inc.</ENAMEX> is acting as agent for the seller .
Meanwhile , some <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> issues were down a touch more than the broad market , but traders said there had n't been much investor selling because of the quake .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York City</ENAMEX> general obligation bonds came under selling pressure .
Traders said a steady stream of bonds was put up for sale <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , pushing yields for longer maturities up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</ENAMEX> percentage point .
Traders said investors were reacting to recent negative news on the city 's finances and are nervous ahead of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Nov. 7 election</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">D.C.</ENAMEX> , topped the competitive slate <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> with a sale of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 200 million</ENAMEX> of general obligation tax revenue anticipation notes .
In late trading , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">New Jersey Turnpike Authority 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.20 %</ENAMEX> issue of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2018</ENAMEX> was off <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/4</ENAMEX> point at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">98</ENAMEX> bid .
The yield was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.35 %</ENAMEX> , up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.01</ENAMEX> percentage point .
Mortgage - Backed Securities
Mortgage securities ended little changed after light dealings .
There was no appreciable market impact from the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> earthquake .
Dealers said there was some concern that insurance companies might be forced to sell mortgage securities to help pay earthquake - related claims , but no selling materialized .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Federal National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> dominant issuers of mortgage securities , have a sizable amount of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> home loans in their mortgagebacked pools .
But their potential quake exposure is seen as small given that they require a financial cushion on all the loans they purchase .
And because <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Northern California</ENAMEX> home prices are so high , loans from the region often are too large to be included in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> pools .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Government National Mortgage Association</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> securities for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November</ENAMEX> delivery ended at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 29/32</ENAMEX> , unchanged .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Freddie Mac</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> securities were at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">97 4/32</ENAMEX> , down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1/32</ENAMEX> .
In derivative markets , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fannie Mae</ENAMEX> issued <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">two $ 400 million</ENAMEX> real estate mortgage investment conduits backed by its <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">9 %</ENAMEX> securities .
Foreign Bonds
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> government bonds , or gilts , ended moderately lower as equities there recovered from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's drop .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11 3/4 %</ENAMEX> bond due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2003 / 2007</ENAMEX> fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">11/32</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">111 31/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10.08 %</ENAMEX> , while the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 %</ENAMEX> notes due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> were down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">7/32</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">103 22/32</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">11.04 %</ENAMEX> .
Traders said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> may be an anxious day for the market .
Several key economic figures are due out and Chancellor of the Exchequer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nigel Lawson</ENAMEX> is scheduled to give the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> `` <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Mansion House</ENAMEX> '' address to the financial community .
The chancellor sometimes has used the occasion to announce major economic policy changes .
Economists do n't expect any such changes in this <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">year</ENAMEX> 's address , given Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lawson</ENAMEX> 's apparent reluctance to adjust policy currently .
Meanwhile , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Japanese</ENAMEX> government bonds retreated in quiet trading , stymied by the dollar 's resiliency .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> 's bellwether <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4.6 %</ENAMEX> bond due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> ended on brokers ' screens at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">95.75</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5.315 %</ENAMEX> .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">West Germany</ENAMEX> , investors stayed on the sidelines as the bond market searched for direction .
The government 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 %</ENAMEX> issue due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1999</ENAMEX> fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.05</ENAMEX> point to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">99.90</ENAMEX> to yield <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.01 %</ENAMEX> .
