<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC 's</COREF> ability *PRO* to produce more petroleum than <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can sell is beginning *-1 to cast a shadow over world oil markets .
Output from <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</COREF> is already at a high for the year and most member nations are running flat out .
But industry and <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> officials agree that a handful of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">members</COREF> still have enough unused capacity *PRO* to glut <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> and cause an oil - price collapse a few months from now if <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> does n't soon adopt a new quota system *PRO*-1 to corral <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> chronic cheaters</COREF> .
As a result , the effort *ICH*-1 by some oil ministers *PRO* to get <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> to approve a new permanent production - sharing agreement next month is taking on increasing urgency .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">The organization</COREF> is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to meet in Vienna beginning Nov. 25 .
So far this year , rising demand for <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> oil</COREF> and production restraint by some members have kept prices *PRO*-1 firm despite rampant cheating by <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">others</COREF> .
But that could change if demand for <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC 's</COREF> oil</COREF> softens seasonally early next year as some think 0 *PRO* may happen .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> is currently producing <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">more than 22 million barrels a day</COREF> , sharply above <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> nominal , self - imposed fourth - quarter ceiling of 20.5 million , according to <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> and industry officials at <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">an oil conference here sponsored * by the Oil Daily and the International Herald Tribune</COREF></COREF> .
At <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">that rate</COREF> , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">a majority of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC 's</COREF> 13 members</COREF></COREF> have reached <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> output limits , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 .
But it is estimated that at least three million barrels a day -- and possibly as much as seven million barrels a day -- of spare capacity still exists within <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> .
Most is concentrated in five Persian Gulf countries , including <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own</COREF> , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Issam Al - Chalabi</COREF> , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq 's</COREF> oil minister</COREF> ,</COREF> told *T*-1 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the conference</COREF> Friday .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> puts <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC 's</COREF> current capacity</COREF> at <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">28 million to 29 million barrels a day</COREF> .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's higher than some other estimates .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ali Khalifa Al - Sabah</COREF> , <COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Kuwait 's</COREF> oil minister</COREF> , recently estimated <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> capacity</COREF> at 25 million barrels a day .
Either way , the overhang is big enough *PRO* to keep delicately balanced oil markets on edge .
Even modest amounts of additional output by those with the huge extra capacity and reserves , such as <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi Arabia</COREF> and <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF></COREF> , could upset <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">The Iraqi oil minister</COREF> and <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi oil minister Hisham Nazer</COREF></COREF> insisted in <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> comments to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the conference</COREF> that <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> countries</COREF> would act responsibly *PRO* to maintain a stable market .
However , in interviews later , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">both ministers</COREF> stressed that <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> expect future <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> quotas to be based *-2 mainly on the production capacity and reserves of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">each member</COREF> .
Under that approach , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">countries with the most unused oil capacity</COREF> would get bigger shares of any future increases in <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC 's</COREF> production ceiling than <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would under the current system .
`` If you are already producing at 95 % or 100 % *U* of your capacity , what 's *T*-2 the good *PRO* to be told *-1 0 you can produce at 105 % of capacity ? '' asked *T*-3 <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Al - Chalabi</COREF> .
At an inconclusive <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Geneva</COREF> meeting late last month , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC 's</COREF> oil ministers</COREF> halfheartedly approved <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">another increase of one million barrels a day in <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> production ceiling</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> doled <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out *PRO*-3 using the existing formula , however , which *T*-1 meant that even those countries that *T*-2 could n't produce more received higher official allotments .
The main effect of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the ceiling boost</COREF> was *PRO* to `` legitimize '' some of the overproduction already coming from <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the quota cheaters</COREF> .
Still , there was a breakthrough at <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Geneva</COREF> .
Previously , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">no <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> member</COREF> had been willing *PRO*-1 to accept a reduction in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> percentage share of <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the group 's</COREF> total output target</COREF> , or ceiling .
But the concept of disproportionate quotas for those with unused capacity , advanced * there in <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">an Iranian proposal</COREF> , was generally endorsed *-1 by <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the ministers</COREF> .
In the end politics got in the way .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Libya</COREF> accepted <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Iran 's</COREF> proposal</COREF> only so long as <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was promised *-1 production parity with <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Kuwait</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="84" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the United Arab Emirates</COREF> , <COREF ID="84" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a chronic quota cheater</COREF> ,</COREF> refused *PRO*-1 to give any guarantee 0 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would change <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> ways .
But <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the oil ministers</COREF> continue *-1 to study <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> , and <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will probably be the basis for discussion at next month 's meeting .
It 's understood 0 several compromises already have been worked *-1 into <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> .
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">The ceiling</COREF> would be lifted *-1 to 21.5 million barrels *PRO*-1 to provide <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Kuwait</COREF> and <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the United Arab Emirates</COREF> much higher official quotas while *PRO*-2 reducing percentage shares of some others .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Libya 's</COREF> previous conditions are no longer considered *-1 a problem , although <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the United Arab Emirates</COREF> is still an issue .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Saudi Arabia</COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC 's</COREF> kingpin</COREF> ,</COREF> also has surfaced as a possible obstacle , some <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> sources said 0 *T*-1 .
*PRO*-1 Insisting on a 24.5 % share of any ceiling , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi officials</COREF> have long pressed for the pro rata distribution of increases to <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">all members</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Geneva</COREF> , however , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> supported <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Iran 's</COREF> proposal</COREF> because <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would have left the Saudi percentage of <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> total</COREF> *PRO*-1 intact , and increased actual Saudi volume to nearly 5.3 million barrels daily from five million .
Some of the proposed modifications since , however , call on <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi Arabia</COREF> to `` give back '' to the production - sharing pool <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">a token 23,000 barrels</COREF> .
Though *PRO* tiny , <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's a reduction in <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> share .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Nazer</COREF> , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Saudi oil minister</COREF> ,</COREF> reiterated here that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the kingdom</COREF> would insist on *PRO* maintaining <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> percentage share of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> production under any quota revisions .
`` Under any circumstances , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi Arabia</COREF> should get more '' rather than less , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Nazer</COREF> said *T*-1 .
