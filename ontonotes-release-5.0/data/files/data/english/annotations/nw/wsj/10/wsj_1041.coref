Federal health officials are expected *-1 today to <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">approve</COREF> a program granting long - deferred access to <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the drug AZT</COREF> for <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">children with <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">acquired immune deficiency syndrome</COREF></COREF> .
Announcement of <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the approval</COREF> is expected *T*-2 to be made *-1 by <COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Louis Sullivan</COREF> , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">secretary of Health and Human Services</COREF> .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">The clearance by <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the Food and Drug Administration</COREF></COREF> comes after two years of restricted access for <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the youngest victims of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">AIDS</COREF></COREF> to <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the only antiviral drug yet cleared *PRO* to treat <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the fatal disease</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">The drug</COREF> will be <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">given</COREF> *-1 <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">treatment investigational new drug status</COREF> , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a label accorded * to drugs believed * effective but lacking formal approval</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">The move</COREF> will make <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the drug</COREF> available free of charge for a time to children with <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the disease</COREF> and symptoms of advanced infection .
Adults with <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">AIDS</COREF> have had access to <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT</COREF> since <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">FDA</COREF> approved <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the drug 's</COREF> usage for adults in March 1987 .
But despite more than two years of research showing 0 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT</COREF> can relieve <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">dementia</COREF> and other symptoms in children , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the drug</COREF> still lacks federal approval for use in the youngest patients .
As a result , many youngsters have been unable *PRO*-1 to obtain <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the drug</COREF> and , for the few exceptions , insurance carriers wo n't cover <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> cost of $ 6,400 *U* a year .
So far , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">AIDS</COREF> has stricken <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">1,859 children under age 13</COREF> , with many times that number believed * to carry <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the infection</COREF> without symptoms .
To date , 1,013 of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">those children</COREF> have died , according to the federal Centers for Disease Control .
Mothers of young <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">AIDS</COREF> patients expressed somber satisfaction .
`` *PRO* Thank goodness 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's happening .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> should have happened sooner , '' said *T*-2 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Elizabeth Glaser</COREF> , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Los Angeles mother and activist who *T*-1 contracted <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">AIDS</COREF> virus</COREF> through a blood transfusion , and transmitted <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">two of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> children</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="44" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">One of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a daughter Ariel</COREF> ,</COREF> died a year ago at age seven after <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> parents unsuccessfully pleaded for <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the drug</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could get <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT</COREF> , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Glaser , who *T*-1 bears <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> infection without any symptoms</COREF> .
`` But <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> daughter</COREF> could n't *?* , until <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was too ill *PRO* to take <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
*PRO* To watch your child die is an inhuman experience . ''
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> son , *PRO*-1 healthy and symptom - free , currently takes no medication .
The delay in *PRO* getting <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT</COREF> to children has been blamed *-1 on a combination of factors .
Traditionally , the medical establishment has waited two years *PRO*-1 to approve adult treatments for pediatric uses , because of a combination of conservative safety standards and red tape .
Secondly , critics have charged <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT 's</COREF> maker Burroughs Wellcome Co.</COREF> with corporate inertia because children account for just 1 % of the patient population and hence a small part of the large and lucrative market .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Wellcome</COREF> has replied that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is moving ahead *PRO*-2 to compile the relevant data , and recently promised *PRO*-1 to develop a pediatric syrup form easier 0 for youngsters to take *T*-3 .
Still , all this comes nearly a year and a half after <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Philip Pizzo of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the National Cancer Institute</COREF></COREF> offered evidence that <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT</COREF> could reverse the ravages of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">AIDS</COREF> dementia</COREF> , *PRO*-1 sometimes prompting dramatic recovery of IQ levels and reappearance of lost motor skills .
Since then , roughly 50 pediatric patients have received <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the drug</COREF> in <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> program .
To some mothers , the expected <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">FDA</COREF> action is a poignant reminder of what *T*-1 might have been .
`` <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> first reaction is 0 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't understand why <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's taken so long *T*-1 .
Why has it *EXP*-1 taken <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> so long for <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> to understand 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">pediatric AIDS</COREF> is a major problem *T*-3 ? '' asked *T*-4 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Helen Kushnick , whose son Samuel *T*-2 died six years ago at age three , *PRO*-5 victim of a tainted transfusion</COREF> .
Similar sentiments were voiced *-2 on Capitol Hill .
`` While <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm pleased 0 <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the FDA</COREF> is finally releasing <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT</COREF> for children , it *EXP*-1 's taken much too long *PRO* to get to this point , '' said *T*-2 <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Rep. Ted Weiss</COREF> .
`` Why did it *EXP*-2 take <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Burroughs Wellcome</COREF> so long *PRO* to apply '' for <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">treatment investigational new drug status</COREF> *T*-3 ? <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Democrat</COREF> asked *T*-1 .
`` *PRO* Let 's not forget 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is the same company that *T*-1 has been profiteering with <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">this drug</COREF> for 2 1/2 years , '' <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Weiss</COREF> added *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Glaser , who *T*-1 is a co-founder of the Pediatric AIDS Foundation , based * in Santa Monica , Calif. ,</COREF> condemned neither bureaucratic nor corporate foot - dragging .
`` There 's no finger 0 *T*-2 to be pointed *-1 , '' <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> said *T*-3 .
`` The crucial thing is that <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> learn <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> lesson well , and *PRO* to make sure 0 other experimental drugs , like Bristol - Myers Co. 's DDI , do n't follow the same frustrating course as <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">AIDS</COREF> dementia -- which *T*-1 gradually steals children 's ability *PRO* to speak , walk and think --</COREF> is often the most striking aspect of <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the pediatric syndrome</COREF> .
For <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">some patients</COREF> , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT</COREF> has <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">restored</COREF> the ability *PRO* to ride a bicycle or solve puzzles , *PRO* giving back a piece of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> childhood if only temporarily .
`` It *EXP*-3 's impossible *PRO* to overstate how much <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> means *T*-4 to the families of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">these patients</COREF> , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Samuel Broder</COREF> , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the National Cancer Institute</COREF> and a main developer of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">AZT</COREF></COREF> .
