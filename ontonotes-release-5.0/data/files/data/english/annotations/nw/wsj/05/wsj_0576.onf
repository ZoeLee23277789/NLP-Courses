    Having resided in the great state of California for the past seven years, I find it hard to ignore our environmental
    problems when I start my commute to work with eyes tearing and head aching from the polluted air ; when I try to enjoy
    the beaches and come home covered with tar and oil ; when I hear of numerous deaths related to irresponsible processing
    of cheese and use of chemicals in fruit growing.
