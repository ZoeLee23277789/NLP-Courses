But seesaw gyrations in <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the Dow Jones Industrial Average</COREF> yesterday put <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street</COREF> back in the spotlight and inspired market participants *PRO*-1 to bid <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. unit</COREF> *PRO*-2 lower .
UAL 's decision *PRO* to remain an independent company sent share prices *PRO*-1 tumbling .
By midmorning , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the DJIA</COREF> had <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">plunged</COREF> 80 points and foreign - exchange dealers quickly drove <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> down .

<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> added that <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the DJIA 's</COREF> swift drop</COREF> proved an easy excuse 0 for <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> to drive <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. currency</COREF> in the direction 0 <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was already headed *-2 *T*-1 *T*-3 .
In late New York trading yesterday , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> was quoted *-1 at 1.8355 marks , down from 1.8470 marks Monday , and at 141.45 yen , down from 141.90 yen <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">late Monday</COREF> .

<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tom Trettien</COREF> , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a vice president with Banque Paribas in <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> sees a break in <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar 's</COREF> long - term upward trend</COREF> , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a trend that *T*-1 began in January 1988</COREF> .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> argues that <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> is now `` moving sideways , '' *PRO*-1 adding that `` the next leg could be the beginning of a longer term bearish phase . ''
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Analysts</COREF> peg <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar 's</COREF> recent weakness to an underlying slowdown in the U.S. economy , highlighted * by recent economic data , particularly a surprisingly sharp widening in the August U.S. trade gap .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also point out that narrowing interest - rate differentials between <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> major trading partners tend *-1 to make <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. currency</COREF> less attractive to foreign investors .

<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Traders</COREF> attribute <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the mark 's</COREF> surge to a robust West German economy and higher rate differentials .
But , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> add that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the mark 's</COREF> strength is in part a reflection of a shift away from U.S. assets by Japanese investors into West German investments .
`` The question *ICH*-1 remains : how much can the West German market absorb *T*-2 ? '' says *T*-3 one senior dealer .
Some dealers say that <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Bank of Japan</COREF> Governor Satoshi Sumita 's reassurance that Japanese monetary policy wo n't be changed *-1 for the time being has given investors an added excuse 0 *PRO* to push <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the yen</COREF> down even further against <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the mark</COREF> *T*-2 .
Despite <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the yen 's</COREF> weakness with respect to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the mark</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> traders</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't expect <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the Bank of Japan</COREF> to take any action *PRO* to support <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese currency</COREF> on that front .
Meanwhile , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">sterling</COREF> slumped on <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">news that <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the United Kingdom</COREF> posted a wider - than - *PRO* expected *-1 trade deficit in September</COREF> .
