<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lomas Financial Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> , said it will ask a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> bankruptcy court to allow it to hire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lazard Freres -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> to help it sell its leasing unit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lomas</ENAMEX> , assisted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch Capital Markets</ENAMEX> , has been trying to sell its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Equitable Lomas Leasing Co.</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several months</ENAMEX> , apparently without success .
The real estate and mortgage banking concern had hoped to use proceeds from the sale to reduce its debt .
Without cash from asset sales and unable to reach a new bank - credit agreement , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lomas</ENAMEX> defaulted on <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 145 million</ENAMEX> in notes that became due <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 1</ENAMEX> .
It filed for protection from creditors under <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 24</ENAMEX> to give it additional time to work on a plan to restructure its <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1.45 billion</ENAMEX> in senior debt .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lomas</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch</ENAMEX> , which owns bonds and equity in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lomas</ENAMEX> , could n't continue as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lomas</ENAMEX> 's investment banker because it is also a creditor .
It said it chose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lazard</ENAMEX> in part because of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lazard</ENAMEX> 's offices in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , where investors might be interested in a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> leasing company .
