In <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">East Germany</COREF> , where humor has long been the only way 0 *PRO* to express political criticism *T*-1 *T*-2 , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not laughing about <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> new leader Egon Krenz</COREF> .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> is such a contradictory figure that nobody has even come up with any good jokes about <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
`` You have *-2 to have clear feelings about someone before you can make jokes , '' says *T*-3 an East German mother of two who *T*-1 loves swapping political barbs with her friends .
`` With <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Krenz</COREF> , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> just do n't know what *PRO* to expect *T*-1 . ''
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> does n't seem *-2 to be the knee - jerk hardliner 0 many initially thought 0 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was *T*-3 when <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the 52 - year - old <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">Politburo</COREF> member</COREF> was selected <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> *-1 *PRO*-5 to succeed <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Erich Honecker</COREF> *T*-4 .
But <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't appear *-1 to be ready *PRO*-2 to make broad changes either .
According to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">East Germany 's</COREF> ADN news agency , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> spoke to <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev</COREF> by telephone over the weekend and acknowledged 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">East Germany</COREF> could learn from Moscow 's glasnost policies .
Already <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> started *-1 overhauling <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">East Germany 's</COREF> heavily censored and notoriously boring news media .
On <COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Thursday</COREF> , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a day</COREF> after <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">office</COREF> , East German television <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">broke</COREF> into regular programming *PRO*-1 to launch a talk show in which viewers call in questions 0 for a panel of officials to answer *T*-3 *T*-2 .
The regular nightly news program and daily newspapers are also getting a visible injection of Soviet - style glasnost .
`` <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was quite a shock , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">a 43 - year - old East German shopkeeper</COREF> .
`` For the first time in <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> life , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was n't sure whether <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was listening to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> news or West German television . ''
Other changes , including *PRO* easing restrictions on travel for East Germans , are expected *-1 .
But whether such moves can win back the confidence of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">East Germans , who *T*-1 have taken to the streets by the thousands in recent weeks *PRO*-2 to demand democratic changes ,</COREF> <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">depends</COREF> largely on whether <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> feel 0 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can trust <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's a problem .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> is not only closely identified *-1 with <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mentor</COREF> , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Honecker</COREF></COREF> , but also blamed *-1 for *PRO*-2 ordering violent police action against protesters this month and for *PRO*-2 praising China for *PRO*-3 sending tanks against student demonstrators .
`` <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hope 0 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> grows with <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the job</COREF> , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rainer Eppelmann</COREF> , <COREF ID="38" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Protestant pastor in <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">East Berlin</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` The most important thing is that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> have a chance . ''
Although <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> is dedicated *-1 to <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">East Germany 's</COREF> conservative vein of communism , there is much about <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> style that *T*-2 sets <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> apart from <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> party comrades .
Unlike <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Honecker , who *T*-1 tended *-2 to lecture people about socialist values</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> enjoys *PRO*-3 asking questions .
Indeed , one of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first actions as <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">leader</COREF> was *PRO* to visit a gritty machine factory on the outskirts of Berlin and wander among the workers -- a la <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Gorbachev</COREF> .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was later shown *-1 on television , *PRO*-1 fielding questions .
At one point , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> asked <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">a worker</COREF> whether <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thought 0 East Germans were fleeing <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> because of restrictive travel policies .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">The worker 's</COREF> tart reply : `` It 's more than just travel .
People have a sense 0 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is ignoring the real problems in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> society . ''
The exchange was all the more remarkable in that authorities released television footage to Western news agencies .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">This same tendency toward openness</COREF> impressed <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">a group of visiting U.S. congressmen</COREF> this spring .
Rather than *PRO* trying *PRO*-2 to `` lecture <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> , '' says 0 *?* <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">one congressional aide who *T*-1 attended the two - hour meeting</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> `` wanted *PRO*-4 to listen . ''
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rep. Ronnie Flippo</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">D.</COREF> , Ala. -RRB- , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of the members of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the delegation</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was particularly impressed *-1 by <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz 's</COREF> ready admission that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">East Germany</COREF> needed *-2 to change .
`` <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's a very tough man , but one who *T*-1 's also open to arguments , '' adds *T*-2 an aide to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl .
But there 's another side to <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> .
*PRO*-3 Born *-2 in a Baltic town in an area which *T*-1 is now part of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has dedicated <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life to the party apparatus .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> moved quickly through the ranks with the help of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> patron</COREF> , <COREF ID="32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Honecker</COREF></COREF> , and emerged as the heir apparent .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Barbara Donovan</COREF> , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an expert on <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">East Germany</COREF> at Radio Free Europe in Munich</COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> may project a smooth image , but <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> doubts 0 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's a true reformer .
Even if <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is *?* , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> adds 0 *?* , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> appears *-2 to have <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">only limited room for maneuver within <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the Communist Party 's ruling Politburo</COREF></COREF> .
Against <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">this background</COREF> , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the new East German leader</COREF> must move quickly *PRO*-1 to shore up <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> government 's</COREF> standing .
The sudden growth of the opposition movement , together with the steady outflow of citizens escaping through <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> and Hungary , has plunged <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> into <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> deepest political crisis since an anti-Soviet workers ' uprising in 1953 .
`` <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> does n't have any honeymoon period , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">a Western diplomat based * in <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">East Berlin</COREF></COREF> .
`` But if <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's sharp and quick , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has a chance . ''
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">The diplomat</COREF> adds that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> has several things going for <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
The East German economy is strong compared with other East bloc nations .
And <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> relative youth could help <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 project a more vibrant image , contrasting with the perception of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Honecker</COREF> as an out - of - touch old man .
For average East Germans , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Krenz</COREF> remains a puzzle .
`` Either <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was n't being real in the past , or <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is n't being real right now , '' says <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">a 30 - year - old East German doctor</COREF> .
`` Either way , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have a problem with how quickly <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's changed *T*-1 . ''
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">The doctor</COREF> was among dozens of people milling through <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">East Berlin 's</COREF> Gethsemane Church</COREF> Saturday morning .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The walls of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the church</COREF></COREF> are covered *-1 with <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">leaflets , news clippings , and handwritten notes associated * with <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> political opposition</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have *-1 to come here *PRO*-3 to read <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the walls</COREF> , '' says *?* <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the doctor</COREF> , `` because <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's information 0 <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> still ca n't get *T*-2 through the newspapers . ''
Meanwhile , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">East Germany 's</COREF> growing openness</COREF> may even allow the state - controlled news media to display a muted sense of humor .
Television <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> carried a new report on <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">East Berlin 's</COREF> main wallpaper factory and the need *PRO* to boost production .
East Germans remember <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">a comment *ICH*-2 a few years ago by <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Kurt Hager</COREF> , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> top ideologist</COREF></COREF> , that just because a neighbor hangs new wallpaper , there 's no reason 0 *PRO* to change your own *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> point was 0 there is no reason for <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">East Germany</COREF> to copy Soviet - style changes .
`` It *EXP*-2 's hard *PRO* to know whether <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was intended *-3 to be funny , '' says *?* <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">East Berlin</COREF> shopkeeper</COREF> , `` But everyone 0 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know *T*-1 laughed about <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
