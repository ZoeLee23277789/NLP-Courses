<COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">The art of change - ringing</COREF> is peculiar to the English , and , like most English peculiarities , unintelligible to the rest of the world .
<COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">-- Dorothy L. Sayers , `` The Nine Tailors ''</COREF>
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">ASLACTON , <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">England</COREF></COREF>
-- Of all scenes that *T*-219 evoke rural England , this is one of the loveliest *T*-2 : <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">An ancient stone church</COREF> stands amid the fields , the sound of bells cascading from <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> tower</COREF> , *PRO*-1 calling the faithful to evensong .
The parishioners of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">St. Michael and All Angels</COREF> stop *PRO*-1 to chat at the church door , as members <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">here</COREF> always have *?* .
In <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the tower</COREF> , <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">five men and women</COREF> pull rhythmically on ropes attached * to the same five bells that *T*-220 first sounded here in 1614 .
But there is also <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">a discordant , modern note</COREF> in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Aslacton</COREF> , though <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ca n't be heard *-135 by the church - goers enjoying the peal of bells this cool autumn evening .
Like most of the other 6,000 churches in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Britain</COREF> with sets of bells , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">St. Michael</COREF> once had <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own `` band '' of ringers , who *T*-221 would herald every Sunday morning and evening service .
Now , <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">only one local ringer</COREF> *ICH*-1 remains : <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">64 - year - old Derek Hammond</COREF> .
<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">The others here</COREF> today live elsewhere .
<COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> belong to <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">a group of 15 ringers -- including two octogenarians and four youngsters in training -- who *T*-2 drive every Sunday from church to church in a sometimes - exhausting effort *PRO* to keep the bells *PRO*-1 sounding in the many belfries of East Anglia</COREF> .
`` *PRO*-1 To ring for even one service at <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">this tower</COREF> , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *-1 to scrape , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hammond , a retired water - authority worker</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've tried *PRO*-1 to train <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the youngsters</COREF> , but <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> discos and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> dances , and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just drift away . ''
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hammond</COREF> worries that old age and the flightiness of youth will diminish the ranks of the East Anglian group that *T*-223 keeps the <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Aslacton</COREF> bells *PRO*-1 pealing .
History , after all , is not on <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> side .
According to a nationwide survey taken * a year ago , nearly a third of <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">England 's</COREF> church bells</COREF> are no longer rung *-1 on Sundays because there is no one 0 *T*-2 to ring <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is easy *PRO* to see why <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the ancient art</COREF> is on the ropes *T*-2 .
The less complicated version of *PRO* playing tunes on bells , as do *?* the carillons of continental Europe , is considered by the English *-136 to be childish , fit only for foreigners .
<COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">Change - ringing , a mind - boggling exercise 0 the English invented *T*-1 380 years ago ,</COREF> requires physical dexterity -- some bells weigh more than a ton -- combined * with intense mental concentration .
Proper English bells are started *-1 off in `` rounds , '' from the highest - pitched bell to the lowest -- a simple descending scale using , in larger churches , as many as 12 bells .
Then , at a signal , the ringers begin *-1 varying the order in which the bells sound *T*-2 without *PRO* altering the steady rhythm of the striking .
Each variation , or change , can occur only once , the rules state 0 *T*-1 .
Ringers memorize patterns of changes , known * as `` methods , '' which *T*-224 have odd - sounding names like Kent Treble Bob Major or Grandsire Caters .
A series of 5,000 or so changes is a `` peal '' and takes about three hours .
A look at a Thursday night practice at St. Mary Abbot church in the Kensington district of London gives an idea of the work involved * .
Ten shirt - sleeved ringers stand in a circle , one foot ahead of the other in a prize - fighter 's stance , each pulling a rope that *T*-225 disappears through a small hole in the high ceiling of the ringing chamber .
No one speaks , and the snaking of the ropes seems *-1 to make as much sound as the bells themselves *?* , *PRO*-2 muffled *-3 by the ceiling .
*PRO*-1 Totally absorbed , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the ringers</COREF> stare straight ahead , *PRO*-1 using peripheral vision -LRB- <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> call it *PRO*-3 `` rope - sight '' -RRB- *PRO*-2 to watch the other ropes and thus time <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> pulls .
Far above in the belfry , the huge bronze bells , mounted * on wheels , swing madly through a full 360 degrees , *PRO*-1 starting and ending , surprisingly , in the inverted , or mouth - up position .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Skilled ringers</COREF> use <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> wrists *PRO*-1 to advance or retard the next swing , so that one bell can swap places with another in the following change .
In a well - known detective - story involving church bells , <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">English novelist Dorothy L. Sayers</COREF> described ringing as a `` passion -LCB- that -RCB- *T*-1 finds its satisfaction in mathematical completeness and mechanical perfection . ''
Ringers , <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> added 0 *?* , are `` filled *-1 with the solemn intoxication that *T*-226 comes of intricate ritual faultlessly performed * . ''
`` <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">Ringing</COREF> does become a bit of an obsession , '' admits *T*-1 <COREF ID="143" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Stephanie Pattenden</COREF> , <COREF ID="143" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">master of the band at St. Mary Abbot and one of <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">England 's</COREF> best female ringers</COREF> .
<COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is a passion that *T*-227 usually stays in the tower , however .
More often than not , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">ringers</COREF> think of the church as something stuck * on the bottom of the belfry .
When <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> changes are completed *-137 *T*-1 , and after <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have worked up a sweat , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">ringers</COREF> often skip off to the local pub , *PRO*-2 leaving worship for others below .
This does not sit well with some clerics .
With membership of the Church of <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">England</COREF> steadily dwindling , strong - willed vicars are pressing equally strong - willed and often non-religious ringers *PRO*-1 to attend services .
Two years ago , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="145" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Rev. Jeremy Hummerstone</COREF> , <COREF ID="145" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">vicar of <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Great Torrington , Devon</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> got so fed up with ringers who *T*-228 did n't attend service 0 <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> sacked <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the entire band</COREF> ; <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the ringers</COREF> promptly set up a picket line in protest .
`` <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were a self - perpetuating club that *T*-229 treated the tower as sort of a separate premises , '' <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the Vicar Hummerstone</COREF> says *T*-1 .
An entirely new band *ICH*-2 rings today at <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Great Torrington</COREF> , several of whom *T*-1 are members of the congregation .
But there still are n't enough ringers 0 *T*-1 to ring more than six of the eight bells .
At St. Mary 's Church in Ilminster , Somerset , the bells have <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">fallen</COREF> *PRO*-1 silent following a dust - up over church attendance .
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The vicar</COREF> , <COREF ID="146" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">W.D. Jones</COREF> , refuses *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">talk</COREF> about <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , *PRO*-1 saying 0 <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would `` reopen the wound . ''
But <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="148" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">C.J.B. Marshall</COREF> , <COREF ID="148" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">vicar of a nearby church</COREF> ,</COREF> feels 0 the fault is in the stairs from the bell tower that *T*-1 are located *-138 next to the altar .
`` So crunch , crunch , crunch , bang , bang , bang -- here come *T*-4 the ringers from above , *PRO*-1 making a very obvious exit while the congregation is at prayer , '' <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Vicar Marshall</COREF> admits to mixed feelings about this issue , since <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is both a vicar and an active bell - ringer <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> .
`` The sound of bells is a net 0 *T*-1 to draw people into the church , '' <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
`` <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> live in hopes that the ringers themselves will be drawn *-139 into that fuller life . ''
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="149" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers</COREF> , <COREF ID="149" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a sort of parliament of ringing groups</COREF> ,</COREF> aims *PRO*-1 to improve relations with vicars , says 0 *T*-2 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="150" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John C. Baldwin</COREF> , <COREF ID="150" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> hopes *PRO*-1 to speak to students at theological colleges about the joys of bell ringing and will shortly publish a booklet for every vicar in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> entitled * , `` *PRO*-2 The Bells in Your Care . ''
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Baldwin</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> recognize that <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> may no longer have as high a priority in church life and experience . ''
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Baldwin</COREF> is also attacking the greater problem : lack of ringers .
One survey says that of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the 100,000 trained bellringers in <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">England</COREF> today</COREF> , only 40,000 of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> still ring .
Also , ringers do n't always live where the bells need *-1 to be rung *-140 *T*-2 -- like in small , rural parishes and inner - city churches .
But <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the council 's</COREF> program *PRO* to attract and train ringers is only partly successful , says 0 *T*-1 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Baldwin</COREF> .
`` Right now , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're lucky if after five years <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> keep one new ringer out of 10 , '' <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> adds *T*-1 .
One bright sign is that a growing number of women have entered the once male - dominated field ; more than a third of the ringers today are <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">women</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are n't accepted *-1 everywhere , however .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The oldest bell - ringing group in the country</COREF> , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the Ancient Society</COREF> of College Youths</COREF> , founded * in 1637 , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">remains</COREF> male - only , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">a fact that *T*-230 's particularly galling to women because <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the group</COREF> is the sole source of ringers for <COREF ID="152" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Britain 's</COREF> most prestigious churches</COREF> , <COREF ID="152" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">St. Paul 's Cathedral and Westminster Abbey</COREF></COREF> .
This being <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Britain</COREF> , no woman has filed an equal - opportunity suit , but the extent of the problem surfaced this summer in a series of letters to `` <COREF ID="153" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Ringing World</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="153" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a weekly newspaper for ringers</COREF> .
One writer , signing his letter as `` Red - blooded , balanced male , '' remarked on the `` frequency of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">women</COREF> fainting in peals</COREF> , '' and suggested that <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> `` settle back into <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> traditional role of *PRO* making tea at meetings . ''
In the torrent of replies that *T*-1 followed , one woman ringer from Solihull observed that `` the average male ringer leaves quite a lot 0 *T*-2 to be desired *-141 : *PRO*-3 badly dressed , decorated with acne and a large beer - belly , frequently unwashed and unbearably flatulent in peals . ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Another women</COREF> wrote from Sheffield *PRO*-1 to say that in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> 60 years of ringing , `` <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have never known a lady to faint in the belfry .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have seen <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">one or two men</COREF> die , *PRO* bless <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
