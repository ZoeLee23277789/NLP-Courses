<COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">The bond market , which *T*-1 sometimes thrives on bad news ,</COREF> cheered <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday 's</COREF> stock market sell - off and perceptions that the economy is growing weaker .
Early in <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the day</COREF> , bonds rose modestly on economists ' forecasts that <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">this week 's</COREF> slate of economic data will portray an economy headed * for trouble .
Such news is good for bonds because economic weakness sometimes causes the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates in an effort *PRO* to stimulate the economy and stave off a recession .
For example , <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> the Department of Commerce is scheduled *-1 *PRO*-2 to release <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">September</COREF> durable goods report</COREF> .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">The consensus forecast of 14 economists surveyed * by Dow Jones Capital Markets Report</COREF> is for <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">a 1.2 % drop in <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">September</COREF> orders</COREF> .
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> would follow a 3.9 % advance in August .
Bonds received a bigger boost later in <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the day</COREF> when stock prices moved broadly lower *T*-1 .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 26.23 points to 2662.91 .
`` Bond investors have been watching stocks closely , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="121" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Joel Marver</COREF> , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief fixed - income analyst at Technical Data Global Markets Group</COREF></COREF> .
`` When you get a big sell - off in equities *T*-3 , money starts *-4 to shift into bonds , '' which *T*-2 are considered *-1 safer , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *T*-5 .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">The Treasury 's</COREF> benchmark 30 - year bond ended about 1/2 point higher , or up about $ 5 *U* for each $ 1,000 *U* face amount , while the yield slid to 7.93 % from 7.98 % <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Friday</COREF> .
Municipals ended *PRO*-1 mixed , while mortgage - backed and investment - grade corporate bonds rose .
Prices of high - yield , high - risk corporate securities ended *PRO*-1 unchanged .
In more evidence of the growing division between `` good '' and `` bad '' junk bonds , a $ 150 million *U* issue by <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Imo Industries Inc.</COREF> was snapped up *-1 by investors while underwriters for <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Beatrice Co. 's</COREF> $ 350 million *U* issue</COREF> are considering *PRO*-2 restructuring <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the deal</COREF> *PRO*-3 to attract buyers .
In <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> market</COREF> , analysts expect bond prices to trade in narrow ranges <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">this week</COREF> as <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> takes in positive and negative news .
`` On the negative side , <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> will be affected *-1 by constant supply in all sectors of <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> , '' said *T*-2 <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="127" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">William M. Brachfeld</COREF> , <COREF ID="127" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc</COREF></COREF> .
`` On the other hand , we have economic news that *T*-1 is -LCB- expected *-2 to be -RCB- relatively positive for <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the bond market</COREF> .
We will go back and forth with a tilt toward slightly lower yields , '' <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury</COREF> will <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">sell</COREF> $ 10 billion *U* of new two - year notes .
Tomorrow , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="128" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Resolution Funding Corp.</COREF> , <COREF ID="128" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a division of a new government agency created * *PRO* to bail out <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the nation 's</COREF> troubled thrifts</COREF> ,</COREF> will hold <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> first bond auction at which <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will sell <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">$ 4.5 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds</COREF> *T*-1 .
So far , money managers and other bond buyers have n't shown much interest in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Refcorp</COREF> bonds</COREF> .
Analysts have mixed views about <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the two - year note auction</COREF> .
While some say 0 <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the auction</COREF> should proceed smoothly , others contend that <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday 's</COREF> sale of $ 2.58 billion *U* of asset - backed securities by <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Ford Motor Credit Corp.</COREF> may have siphoned some potential institutional buyers from <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> note sale</COREF> .
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">The division of auto maker Ford Motor Co.</COREF> made <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> debut in <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">the asset - backed securities market</COREF> with <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">the second - largest issue in <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">the market 's</COREF> four - year history</COREF> .
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">The company</COREF> offered securities backed * by automobile loans through an underwriting group headed * by <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">First Boston Corp</COREF> .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">The issue</COREF> yields 8.90 % and carries a guarantee covering 9 % of the deal from <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> .
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">First Boston</COREF> sweetened the terms from the original yield estimate in an apparent effort *PRO* to place the huge offering .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">The issue</COREF> was offered *-1 at a yield nearly one percentage point above the yield on two - year Treasurys .
The only asset - backed deal larger than <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Ford 's</COREF> was a $ 4 billion *U* offering by General Motors Acceptance Corp. in 1986 .

The $ 7.81 billion *U* of six - month <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bills were sold *-1 with <COREF ID="134" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">an average discount rate of 7.50 %</COREF> , <COREF ID="134" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the highest since the average of 7.60 % at <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Oct. 10</COREF> auction</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">The rates</COREF> were up from <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">last week 's</COREF> auction , when <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were 7.37 % and 7.42 % , respectively *T*-1</COREF> .
Here are *T*-2 auction details :
Rates are determined *-1 by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the investor 's return</COREF> while lower bidding widens <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
The percentage rates are calculated *-1 on a 360 - day year , while the coupon - equivalent yield is based *-2 on a 365 - day year .
Both issues are dated *-1 Oct. 26 .
The 13 - week bills mature Jan. 25 , 1990 , and the 26 - week bills mature April 26 , 1990 .
Corporate Issues
Investment - grade corporates closed about 1/4 point higher in quiet trading .
In <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the junk bond market</COREF> , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Imo Industries '</COREF> issue of 12 - year debentures , considered * to be one of <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the market 's</COREF> high - quality credits ,</COREF> was priced *-1 at par *PRO*-2 to yield 12 % .

`` <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's a segmented market , and if you have <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">a good , strong credit</COREF> , people have an appetite for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Morgan Stanley</COREF> is expected *-1 to price another junk bond deal , $ 350 million *U* of senior subordinated debentures by Continental Cablevision Inc. , next Tuesday .
In light of the recent skittishness in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the high - yield market</COREF> , junk bond analysts and traders expect <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">other high - yield deals</COREF> to be sweetened or restructured *-2 before <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are offered *-1 to investors .
In the case of <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Beatrice</COREF> , Salomon Brothers Inc. is considering *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">restructuring</COREF> the reset mechanism on the $ 200 million *U* portion of <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the offering</COREF> .
Under the originally contemplated terms of <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">the offering</COREF> , <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the notes</COREF> would have been reset annually at a fixed spread above Treasurys .
Under <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the new plan being considered *</COREF> , <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the notes</COREF> would reset annually at a rate 0 *PRO* to maintain a market value of 101 *T*-1 .

Mortgage - Backed Securities
Activity in derivative markets was strong with four new real estate mortgage investment conduits announced * and talk of several more deals in <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">today 's</COREF> session .
The Federal National Mortgage Association offered $ 1.2 billion *U* of <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Remic</COREF> securities in three issues , and <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.</COREF> offered a $ 250 million *U* <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Remic</COREF> backed * by 9 % 15 - year securities .
Part of the reason for the heavy activity in derivative markets is that underwriters are repackaging mortgage securities being sold * by thrifts .
Traders said 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">thrifts</COREF> have stepped up <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mortgage securities sales as <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the bond market</COREF> has risen in the past two weeks .
In the mortgage pass - through sector , active issues rose but trailed gains in <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> market</COREF> .
<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Government National Mortgage Association</COREF> 9 % securities for November delivery were quoted *-1 late yesterday at 98 10/32 , up 10/32 ; and <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Freddie Mac</COREF> 9 % securities were at 97 1/2 , up 1/4 .
The <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">Ginnie Mae</COREF> 9 % issue was yielding 8.36 % to a 12 - year average life assumption , as the spread above the <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> 10 - year note widened slightly to 1.46 percentage points .
Municipals
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">A $ 575 million *U* <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">San Antonio , Texas ,</COREF> electric and gas system revenue bond issue</COREF> dominated the new issue sector .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">The refunding issue , which *T*-1 had been in the wings for two months ,</COREF> was one of the chief offerings <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">overhanging</COREF> <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> and limiting price appreciation .
But *PRO* alleviating <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">that overhang</COREF> failed *-1 to stimulate much activity in the secondary market , where prices were off 1/8 to up 3/8 point *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">An official with <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">lead underwriter First Boston</COREF></COREF> said 0 orders for the <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">San Antonio</COREF> bonds <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">were</COREF> `` on the slow side . ''
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> attributed <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> to <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the issue 's</COREF> aggressive pricing and large size , as well as the general lethargy in <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">the municipal marketplace</COREF> .
In addition , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> noted 0 *?* , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> would normally be the type purchased * by property and casualty insurers , but recent disasters , such as Hurricane Hugo and the Northern California earthquake , have stretched <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">insurers '</COREF> resources and damped <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> demand for bonds .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">A $ 137.6 million *U* Maryland Stadium Authority sports facilities lease revenue bond issue</COREF> appeared *-1 to be off to a good start .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">The issue</COREF> was oversubscribed and `` doing very well , '' according to an official with <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">lead underwriter Morgan Stanley</COREF> .
Activity quieted in the New York City bond market , where heavy investor selling <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> drove yields on the issuer 's full faith and credit backed bonds up as much as 0.50 percentage point *T*-1 .
Foreign Bonds
Japanese government bonds ended lower after <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">rose</COREF> modestly against the yen .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The turnaround in <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF></COREF> fueled bearish sentiment about Japan 's bond market .
