<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> and <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> conferees agreed *PRO*-1 to continue production of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Grumman Corp. 's</COREF> F - 14</COREF> and to provide more than $ 3.8 billion *U* for <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the Strategic Defense Initiative</COREF> during <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the current fiscal year</COREF> .
Industry officials and congressional aides said that the main points of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">a compromise defense authorization bill , hammered * out during a flurry of private meetings over the past few days ,</COREF> provide a face - saving compromise for both the White House and <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> Democrats .
Although conferees are still putting the finishing touches on <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the package</COREF> , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the final agreement</COREF> could be announced *-1 as early as tomorrow .
An announcement is more likely next week , though .
President Bush and other supporters of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">SDI</COREF> will be able *PRO*-2 to take credit for *PRO*-3 blocking <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> efforts *PRO* to significantly cut <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the program *PRO* to develop a space - based antimissile system , which *T*-1 already has cost some $ 17 billion *U*</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">D.</COREF> , Ga . -RRB- and other <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> conferees have opposed <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> cuts</COREF> , *PRO*-1 stalling for almost two months action on a number of big - ticket items in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon 's</COREF> budget .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">The Senate</COREF> voted *PRO*-1 to authorize $ 4.5 billion *U* for <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">SDI</COREF> spending in <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the current fiscal year</COREF> , but <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF> , *PRO*-2 reflecting a dramatic erosion of support for <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> , earmarked only $ 3.1 billion *U* .
Despite <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the widening gap between the two sides</COREF> , conferees eventually followed the pattern set * in previous years by *PRO*-1 opting *PRO*-2 to roughly <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">split</COREF> <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the difference</COREF> .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> would hold spending on <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> at about the previous year 's level .
The decision *PRO* to keep <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the embattled F - 14 's</COREF> production line *PRO*-1 running for at least another year is an important victory for <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF> , and especially for <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rep. Les Aspin</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="33" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">D.</COREF> , Wis . -RRB-</COREF> .
As the head of the <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> conferees , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Rep. Aspin</COREF> has been under intense pressure *ICH*-1 from <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> colleagues *PRO* to reject <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> provisions that *T*-15 would have abruptly cut further <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">F - 14</COREF> production .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">The package</COREF> `` provides a temporary , golden parachute for <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Grumman</COREF> , '' according to one congressional aide familiar with the closed - door bargaining .
But as part of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the overall agreement</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Grumman</COREF> and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> outspoken supporters on Capitol Hill effectively will be precluded *-1 from *PRO*-2 reopening the emotional issue in the debate over next year 's budget .
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and most senators contend that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the Navy 's F - 14</COREF> is too expensive in an era of shrinking <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Pentagon</COREF> budgets .
But <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the plane</COREF> boasts a strong core of support in <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF> , where members are intent on *PRO*-2 saving <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Grumman</COREF> jobs and are worried about potential shortages of carrier - based aircraft by the late 1990s *T*-1 .
Conferees also agreed to <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Pentagon</COREF> requests *PRO* to earmark a total of nearly $ 1 billion *U* for work on both mobile MX and Midgetman nuclear missiles , according to congressional aides .
And lawmakers are putting the finishing touches on <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">a compromise that *T*-3 would give <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the Air Force</COREF> nearly all of the $ 2.4 billion *U* 0 <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> wants *T*-5 for production of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Northrop Corp. 's radar - eluding B - 2 bombers</COREF> , which *T*-4 cost $ 530 million *U* apiece</COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">The final <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">B - 2</COREF> agreement</COREF> is certain *-1 to require detailed testing and verification of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the bomber 's</COREF> capabilities , but congressional aides said 0 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the accord</COREF> wo n't include a <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">House - passed</COREF> provision that *T*-3 would have withheld production funds until Congress approves a cheaper , scaled - down version of the $ 70 billion *U* fleet of 132 B - 2s envisioned * by <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon</COREF> .
