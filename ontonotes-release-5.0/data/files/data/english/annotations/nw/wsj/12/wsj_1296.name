<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">At least 10</ENAMEX> states are resisting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. 's</ENAMEX> nationwide effort to settle its legal troubles , and some might instead try to revoke the firm 's license to sell securities within their borders .
The reluctance of some states to let <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> off the hook could hamper the firm 's attempts to polish its image after its guilty plea to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> felonies <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</ENAMEX> , say several people familiar with the discussions .
Up to now , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> has made a rapid - fire series of settlements with <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> states and the commonwealth of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Just yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> announced it made a $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">75,000</ENAMEX> settlement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> , a record - tying fine for a securities - law matter in that state .
These states have been entering into settlements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> as part of the firm 's efforts to operate freely anywhere in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> despite its record as an admitted felon .
But individuals familiar with the generally successful <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> talks say the firm is meeting resistance from some big states , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Missouri</ENAMEX> .
Officials in some of these states say they do n't want to simply accept the settlements offered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> .
They question if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> is getting easier treatment than the many small penny - stock firms whose brokerage licenses are routinely revoked .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> has to settle with state securities regulators in the wake of its criminal guilty plea and a related civil settlement with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Securities and Exchange Commission</ENAMEX> that includes payment of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 650 million</ENAMEX> in penalties .
These stem from a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year</ENAMEX> federal investigation of insider trading and securities fraud on Wall Street .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Ohio</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the District of Columbia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tennessee</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Illinois</ENAMEX> have been less resistant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> than the other <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">six</ENAMEX> states , but nonetheless have refused to settle so far , say those familiar with the discussions .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> says it does n't expect any of its state brokerage licenses will be revoked , and even if some are , its securities business would n't be directly hurt .
It already has sold its retail , or individual - investor , brokerage network ; securities firms do n't need brokerage licenses for non-retail activities such as investment banking .
Still , if nothing else , a revoked brokerage license could be a burden because it must be disclosed in many of the transactions in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> could be involved .
Securities regulators praise <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> for its energetic effort , led by government - approved general counsel <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Saul S. Cohen</ENAMEX> , to settle its legal problems with the states .
But they disagree about the message these settlements give to the public .
`` There was a lot of internal debate about that specific issue , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susan Bryant</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> 's chief securities regulator and president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the North American Securities Administrators Association</ENAMEX> , which drafted a voluntary settlement plan for the states with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> .
The question , she said , is whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> should be allowed to pay and move on , or `` whether you should -LRB- simply -RRB- revoke the license when someone is convicted of a felony . ''
While Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX> 's state went ahead and accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's settlement offer of $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">25,000</ENAMEX> , she said : `` I do n't have any argument with those who came to different conclusions .
I can see both sides . ''
Similarly , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Rubega</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire 's</ENAMEX> director of securities regulation , said his state had n't received any complaints about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> , so it really could n't press the issue .
Still , `` I understand the reasons '' that other states are holding out , he said .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> general counsel , said , `` I do n't think , as we say in investment banking , that ` by <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the end of the day</ENAMEX> ' we 'll be losing any licenses . ''
Asked about states that are taking a hard line , he said , `` There are states that have asked for additional information , which we are providing to them . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said more than <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2.8 million</ENAMEX> has been paid to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</ENAMEX> states and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> still expects to pay out a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 11.5 million</ENAMEX> .
By <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of this week</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> should have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">another three to four</ENAMEX> settlements , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> said .
`` The rate we 're going , I think that by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of the month</ENAMEX> , we 're looking to have a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">30 to 35</ENAMEX> , '' he said .
That total would be important for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> .
The investment bank has previously announced that as part of its punishment it would create an independent foundation to promote ethical behavior in the securities industry .
A proviso to that promise is that a minimum of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35</ENAMEX> states reach settlement agreements before <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next Tuesday</ENAMEX> .
There are , according to several securities commissioners , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 16</ENAMEX> states that are either close to settlements with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> or who do n't appear opposed to settling .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's proposed state fines have been based on a state 's population and on the size of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's business in the state .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Jersey</ENAMEX> , for example , was asked to accept $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">300,000</ENAMEX> , but refused .
The state is n't ruling out revoking <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's brokerage license .
The state can also bar <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> as an investment adviser .
State officials wo n't describe their position in detail , but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James McLelland Smith</ENAMEX> , state securities chief , said : `` We really are still looking at it and have informed -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> -RRB- that the proposal is really not sufficient for settlement . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Connecticut</ENAMEX> already has issued a `` notice of intent '' to revoke <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's brokerage license .
It is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the states that have met with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cohen</ENAMEX> and asked for additional information about investors ' accounts and other matters .
`` This particular issue goes to the very integrity of the capital - formation market , '' state Banking Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Brown</ENAMEX> said .
A banking department spokesman added : `` Commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> does n't feel that money alone is the issue here . ''
Particularly touchy are the cases of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's base , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> , the base of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's highly profitable junk - bond operation that led to the firm 's legal difficulties .
Neither state has settled , and officials in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> states wo n't discuss their reasons for not doing so .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> has made it clear it could mount a significant legal battle in each state if its license is revoked , according to state officials .
Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX> , the head of the state securities group , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> has done a better job of settling with the states than <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">E.F. Hutton</ENAMEX> did after its guilty plea to a massive check - kiting scheme <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several years ago</ENAMEX> .
Still , she said , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> 's trouble with some states is n't a bad thing .
`` This process should point out that it 's not going to be easy for a firm that 's convicted of a felony to immediately jump back into the retail business , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bryant</ENAMEX> said .
`` We need to have somebody worried so they do n't do this again . ''
These are the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26</ENAMEX> states , including the commonwealth of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> , that have settled with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Drexel</ENAMEX> : <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Alaska</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arkansas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Delaware</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Georgia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hawaii</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Idaho</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Indiana</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iowa</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kansas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kentucky</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maine</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maryland</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mississippi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Hampshire</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New Mexico</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">North Dakota</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oklahoma</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Oregon</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Carolina</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Dakota</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Vermont</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyoming</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX> .
