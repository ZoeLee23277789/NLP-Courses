Many thanks for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alexander Cockburn 's</ENAMEX> comic masterpiece -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">U.S. . Economy : A House Built on Junk - Bond Sand</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Viewpoint</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 19</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
The use of the abominable construction practices in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Soviet Union</ENAMEX> -- as evidenced by the collapse of sand apartment blocks during the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Armenian</ENAMEX> earthquake -- as a metaphor for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> economic system was a sublime example of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cockburn</ENAMEX> 's satirical muse .
I await his sequel : the economic and social resiliency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area and the outstanding work of the local governments and the private charitable organizations there as metaphors for the supremacy of whatever failed system Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cockburn</ENAMEX> now believes in .
It should be a scream .
