AMONG THE CATFISH farmers in the watery delta land of Humphreys County , Miss. , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Allen D. Tharp of Isola</COREF> was one of the best known and most enterprising .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> sold quarter - inch fingerlings 0 *T*-2 to stock other farmers ' ponds , and <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> bought back one - pound - or - so food - fish that <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> `` live - hauled '' *T*-1 to market along with <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own whiskery crop .
And <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> nearly always bought and sold for cash .
Along the way , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Tharp</COREF> omitted a total of $ 1.5 million *U* from <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> receipts reported * on <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">federal tax returns for three years</COREF> .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">The returns</COREF> landed in the hands of <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Internal Revenue Service</COREF> criminal investigator</COREF> , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Samuel James Baker</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Baker</COREF> interviewed *RNR*-1 or wrote to *RNR*-1 hundreds of catfish farmers , live - haulers and processors throughout the South before *PRO*-2 coming up with <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">detailed estimates of purchases and sales , in pounds and dollars , by <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Tharp</COREF> and others</COREF> .
*PRO* Unknown to <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Tharp</COREF> , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had fouled <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> net on a special <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">IRS</COREF> project 0 *T*-1 to catch catfish farmers and haulers inclined *PRO* to cheat on their taxes .
*PRO*-2 Confronted *-1 with <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the evidence</COREF> , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Tharp</COREF> pleaded guilty to one charge of *PRO*-2 filing a false return and was fined *-2 $ 5,000 *U* and sentenced *-2 to 18 months in prison .
<COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also owes a lot of back taxes , interest and civil fraud penalties .
A lot of taxpayers out there are n't as paranoid as one might think 0 *?* .
Federal and state tax enforcers develop many group targets for investigation , on the basis of occupation , high income , type of income , or some other characteristic that *T*-1 may signal an opportunity or tendency *PRO* to hide income or exaggerate deductions .
Many professions long have seemed *-3 to be targets *ICH*-5 because of the exotic or ludicrous efforts *ICH*-4 of some members *PRO* to offset high income with fake losses from phony tax shelters : dentists who *T*-1 invested in dubiously dubbed foreign films or airline pilots who *T*-2 raised racehorses on their days off .
Mail - order ministers have been squelched *-1 .
Now , television and radio evangelists are under scrutiny .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">The IRS</COREF> recently won part of <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> long - running battle with <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the Church of Scientology</COREF> over exemptions when the U.S. Supreme Court held that <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">members '</COREF> payments to <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the church</COREF> were n't deductible because <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">the members</COREF> received services in return *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">IRS</COREF> statistics show that the more persistent hiders of income among sole proprietors of businesses include used - car dealers , entertainment producers , masons , roofers , and taxi owners .
Small businesses in general account for almost 40 % of unreported personal income , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> has said 0 *T*-1 .
Once such abuses become so pervasive , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> builds another factor into <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> secret computer formula for *PRO* selecting <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">returns</COREF> for audit</COREF> and does n't need special projects for <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">San Franciscans</COREF> have a much higher incidence of audits than average because more of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> score high under <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">that formula</COREF> , not because <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">IRS</COREF> agents envy <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> life styles .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Many openings for mass cheating , such as questionable tax shelters and home offices ,</COREF> have gaped so broadly that Congress has passed stringent laws *PRO*-1 to close <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Deductions of charitable gifts of highly valued art now must be accompanied *-1 by appraisals .
And laws requiring the reporting of more varieties of transactions have enabled <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> *PRO*-2 to rely on computers to ferret out discrepancies with returns and to generate form - letter inquiries to taxpayers .
Unreported alimony income can be spotted *-1 by computer because a payer of alimony -LRB- who *T*-2 gets a deduction -RRB- must report the former spouse 's <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Social Security</COREF> number .
Passport applicants now must give <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Social Security</COREF> numbers , *PRO* enabling <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> *PRO*-1 to see whether <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Americans living abroad</COREF> are filing required U.S. returns .
But while <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">IRS</COREF> computers focus routinely on target groups like <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the agency</COREF> has assigned many agents to <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">special projects that *T*-1 need more personal attention</COREF> .
In most cases , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> says 0 *?* , <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">these projects</COREF> are local or regional , rather than national , and arise because auditors in an area detect some pattern of abuse among , say , factory workers claiming that *PRO* having a multitude of dependents frees them from tax withholding or yacht owners deducting losses from sideline charter businesses .
The national office currently has 21 noncriminal audit projects , according to <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="120" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Marshall V. Washburn</COREF> , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">deputy assistant commissioner for examination</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Auditors involved * in noncriminal projects</COREF> ca n't send anyone to jail , but <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can make life miserable in other ways -- for one , by *PRO*-1 imposing some of the 150 different civil penalties for negligence , failure *PRO* to file a return , and the like .
The targeted audit groups include <COREF ID="122" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">direct sellers</COREF> -- <COREF ID="122" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">people who *T*-1 sell cosmetics , housewares and other items door to door or at home parties</COREF> -- and employers who *T*-2 label workers as independent contractors instead of employees , *PRO*-3 to avoid the employer share of payroll taxes .
Other projects look for offenders among waiters who *T*-1 get cash tips , people who *T*-2 engage in large cash transactions , and people whose returns *T*-3 show 0 they sold a home for a profit without *PRO*-4 reinvesting <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the capital gain</COREF> in another home by the end of the same year ; <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the gain</COREF> must be rolled *-5 over within two years *PRO* to defer tax .
And now that returns must show dependents ' <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Social Security</COREF> numbers , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> wants *PRO*-4 to see which dependents *T*-2 show up on more than one return -- and which dependents *T*-3 turn out *-5 to be deceased .
Impetus for the direct - seller project came from <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">a congressional hearing some years back</COREF> .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> prompted <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">an <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">IRS</COREF> study that *T*-1 found 0 many sellers were concealing income and treating large amounts of nondeductible travel and other personal expenses as business costs</COREF> , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Washburn</COREF> says 0 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">The study</COREF> provided criteria for *PRO* singling out returns of `` potentially noncompliant '' taxpayers who *T*-1 report low income and large expenses from a part - time business .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">The Tax Court</COREF> recently denied business deductions by <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. and Mrs. Peter S. Rubin of Cherry Hill , N.J. , who *T*-1 both were part - time distributors of <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Amway</COREF> products in addition to their regular jobs as sales people in other fields</COREF> .
For 1984 , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> reported gross income of $ 1,647 *U* from <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Amway</COREF> sales , offset * by expenses totaling $ 16,746 *U* -- including car costs of $ 6,805 *U* and travel and entertainment costs of $ 5,088 *U* .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">The Tax Court</COREF> did n't believe that <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the Rubins , who *T*-1 earned $ 65,619 *U* in their regular jobs</COREF> , treated the sideline as <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">a real business</COREF> and derived `` merely incidental elements of recreation and other personal pleasure and benefits '' from <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="127" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Direct Selling Association</COREF> , <COREF ID="127" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a trade group</COREF> ,</COREF> points out that <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> members , which *T*-1 include <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Amway Corp.</COREF> , cooperate with <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> *PRO*-2 to distribute tax - compliance material to sales people and are helping *PRO* to prepare a public - service television program on the subject .
<COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">The independent - contractor project , which *T*-1 began in 1988 ,</COREF> involves <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">about 350 <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">IRS</COREF> agents</COREF> .
In the fiscal nine months ended June 30 , reports 0 *?* <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Raymond P. Keenan</COREF> , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">assistant commissioner for collection</COREF> , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> examined about 13,000 employers , assessed more than $ 67 million *U* in delinquent employment taxes , and reclassified about 56,000 workers as employees instead of self - employed contractors .
The number of misclassified workers may be in the millions , *PRO*-2 mostly paid *-1 by small firms .
Many workers , especially professionals , want *PRO*-1 to remain independent *PRO*-1 to avoid tax withholding and to continue *-2 to deduct many expenses that employees ca n't *?* *T*-3 .
But many others , who *T*-1 want *PRO*-3 to qualify for employee benefits and unemployment compensation , become tipsters for <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> , says 0 *T*-4 <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Jerry Lackey , who *T*-2 manages <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">IRS</COREF> project 's</COREF> force of nine agents in north and central Florida from Orlando</COREF> .
Firms that *T*-1 are paying employment taxes also provide leads to competitors that *T*-2 are n't *?* , <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *T*-3 .
In <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> area , <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lackey</COREF> continues 0 *?* , the miscreant employers most commonly are in construction -- *PRO*-2 doing framing , drywall , masonry and similar work .
But a medical clinic with <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">about 20 employees</COREF> wrongly listed all of <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> -- including physicians and receptionists -- as independent contractors .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">The IRS</COREF> assessed the clinic $ 350,000 *U* in back payroll taxes .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> assessed nearly $ 500,000 *U* against a cruise - ship company that *T*-1 carried about 100 deckhands , cooks , bartenders , entertainers and other employees as self - employed independents .
Revenue - short states also are becoming more aggressive pursuers of <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">tax delinquents</COREF> , and perhaps none tracks <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> down with more relish than does <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> since <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> acquired an $ 80 million *U* computer system in 1985 .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">The state 's</COREF> tax enforcers</COREF> have amassed data bases from other <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> agencies that *T*-1 license or register professionals and businesses ; from exchange agreements with <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the IRS</COREF> , 24 other states , and two Canadian provinces , and even from phonebook Yellow Pages .
Thus *PRO*-3 armed *-2 for massive matching of documents by computer , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> single out high - income groups , *PRO*-3 looking primarily for people who *T*-1 have n't filed <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> income - tax returns .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">The state</COREF> has combed through records relating to architects , stockbrokers , lawyers in the New York City area , construction workers from out of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> , and homeowners who *T*-1 claim *PRO*-3 to be residents of other states -- especially <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Florida , which *T*-2 has no personal income tax</COREF> .
Soon *PRO*-3 to feel the glare of attention are *T*-2 lawyers elsewhere in <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> , doctors , dentists , and accountants , says <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Frederick G. Hicks</COREF> , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the tax - department division that *T*-1 develops the computer - matching programs</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">The department</COREF> has collected over $ 6.5 million *U* from <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">brokers</COREF> so far and recommended more than 30 of <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> for criminal prosecution .
In the early stage of *PRO* <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">checking</COREF> people with incomes exceeding $ 500,000 *U* who *T*-1 were filing nonresident returns , <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> squeezed $ 7.5 million *U* out of a man who *T*-2 was posing as a <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Florida</COREF> resident .
`` <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can reclaim hundreds of millions of dollars just through <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">the nonresident project</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hicks</COREF> declares *T*-1 .
