<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">International Business Machines Corp.</COREF> <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">said</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">agreed</COREF> *PRO*-1 to let <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Motorola Inc.</COREF> participate in <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">a semiconductor research project</COREF> as part of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> effort *PRO* to bolster <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. semiconductor industry</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM , which *T*-2 made <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the announcement</COREF> at the dedication of a research center here ,</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">invited</COREF> many other companies *ICH*-3 *PRO*-1 to participate as well , including some from Europe .
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jack Kuehler</COREF> , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM 's</COREF> president</COREF> , said 0 IBM is also considering *PRO*-1 letting other companies participate in additional semiconductor work but declined *PRO*-2 to be more specific .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM , which *T*-1 said a year ago 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was inviting companies *PRO*-3 to participate in some semiconductor work ,</COREF> has become far more open about <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> technology as <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has tried *PRO*-4 to rally <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. industry</COREF> *PRO*-5 to head off the Japanese , who *T*-2 now dominate <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the market for dynamic random access memory chips</COREF> .
While <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM , Armonk , N.Y. ,</COREF> makes <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the bulk of the DRAMs 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> uses *T*-1</COREF> , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't make the equipment needed * *PRO* to produce <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">those chips</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM</COREF> worries that the Japanese will take over that equipment market , too , unless U.S. semiconductor companies produce enough memory chips *ICH*-2 here 0 *T*-1 to keep U.S. equipment makers *PRO*-3 healthy .
Failure of U.S. equipment makers , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM</COREF> fears 0 *?* , would leave <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-3 dependent on many of the Japanese companies that *T*-1 compete with <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in other parts of the market .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM</COREF> also said 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> expects *PRO*-2 to benefit from the expertise that <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Motorola</COREF> and other companies can bring *T*-1 *PRO* to bear on the difficult problems involved * in semiconductor manufacturing .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM</COREF> already participates in one industrywide effort *PRO* to improve semiconductor - manufacturing techniques .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> expects industrywide efforts to become prevalent because semiconductor manufacturing has become so expensive .
A state - of - the - art plant cost $ 40 million *U* in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the mid-1970s</COREF> but <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">costs</COREF> $ 500 million *U* today because the technology is so complex .
And <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> expects <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the costs</COREF> to continue *-1 climbing .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM , which *T*-1 said 0 <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Motorola</COREF> is paying just a nominal fee *PRO* to cover <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the 21 - month agreement</COREF> ,</COREF> acknowledged 0 some companies had <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">turned</COREF> down <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> invitation *PRO* to join in</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was mainly because <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the project</COREF> may not bear fruit until the mid-1990s .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">IBM</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> thought 0 more companies would become interested as <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the project</COREF> progresses .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The project involving <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Motorola</COREF></COREF> concerns a technique , called * *PRO*-3 X-ray lithography , that *T*-1 figures *PRO*-2 to be crucial to future generations of memory chips .
Currently , chips are produced *-1 by *PRO* shining light through a mask *PRO* to produce an image on the chip , much as a camera produces an image on film .
But details on chips must now be extraordinarily fine , and <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the wavelengths of even ultraviolet light</COREF> are long enough so that the images 0 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> draw *T*-1 may be too blurry -- much as someone using a wide paintbrush could produce a broad line but would have trouble *PRO* painting a thin one .
X-rays , by contrast , travel straighter and can be focused more tightly than light .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">X-rays</COREF> have <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">problems</COREF> , too .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> can make the masks brittle and can pass through material 0 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not supposed *-1 to *?* *?* *T*-2 .
But , *PRO* assuming 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">those problems</COREF> can be overcome *-1 , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should allow for memory chips that *T*-3 could approach <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">one billion bits of information</COREF> -- <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">250 times as much as *?* is contained *-2 in the four - megabit chips that *T*-4 are just reaching <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> and a million times what *T*-5 was possible in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the mid-1970s</COREF></COREF> .
