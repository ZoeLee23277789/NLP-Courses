    The Federal Housing Administration , Veterans Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development further
    aggravate the problem of affordable housing stock by `` *PRO*-3 buying in '' to their foreclosed properties -LRB- of
    which there are , alas , many *T*-1 -RRB- at an inflated `` balance due '' -- *PRO* say $ 80,000 *U* on a house worth $
    55,000 *U* -- instead of allowing a free market to price the house for what it 's really worth *T*-2 .
