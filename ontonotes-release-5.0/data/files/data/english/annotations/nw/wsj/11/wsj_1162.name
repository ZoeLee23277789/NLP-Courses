People start their own businesses for many reasons .
But a chance to fill out sales - tax records is rarely <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of them .
Red tape is the bugaboo of small business .
Ironically , the person who wants to run his or her own business is probably the active , results - oriented sort most likely to hate meeting the rules and record - keeping demands of federal , state and local regulators .
Yet every business owner has to face the mound of forms and regulations -- and often is the only one available to tackle it .
There is hope of change .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</ENAMEX> , Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Malcolm Wallop</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">R.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Wyo .</ENAMEX> -RRB- held hearings on a bill to strengthen an existing law designed to reduce regulatory hassles for small businesses .
`` A great many federal regulations are meant for larger entities and do n't really apply to small businesses , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marian Jacob</ENAMEX> , a legislative aide to Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wallop</ENAMEX> .
Other lawmakers are busy trying to revive the recently lapsed <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Paperwork Reduction Act</ENAMEX> , which many feel benefited small enterprises .
Thus , optimistic entrepreneurs await a promised land of less red tape -- just as soon as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Uncle Sam</ENAMEX> gets around to arranging it .
Meanwhile , they tackle the mounds of paper -- and fantasize about a dream world where bulk - mail postal regulations and government inspectors are banished .
To find out what red tape riles entrepreneurs most , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Journal</ENAMEX> asked a completely unscientific , random sample of business owners to fantasize about the forms and regulations they would most like to get lost in the mail .
Some entrepreneurs say the red tape they most love to hate is red tape they would also hate to lose .
They concede that much of the government meddling that torments them is essential to the public good , and even to their own businesses .
Rules that set standards for products or govern business behavior , generally the best regarded form of red tape , `` create a level playing field and keep unscrupulous competitors away , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sidney West</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">TechDesign International Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Springfield</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Va.</ENAMEX> , business that designs telecommunication and other products .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">West</ENAMEX> cites <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Communications Commission</ENAMEX> and its standards for telecommunications equipment : `` They monitor product quality and prevent junk from flooding the market . ''
Some gripes about red tape are predictable : Architects complain about a host of building regulations , auto leasing companies about car insurance rules .
Determining when handicapped access is required can be a nightmare for architects , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Dooling</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Dooling -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Newton</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , architectural firm .
There is such a maze of federal , state and local codes that `` building inspectors are backing away from interpreting them , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dooling</ENAMEX> says .
Taxi , leasing and other companies that maintain fleets of vehicles devote substantial resources to complying with state insurance laws and a host of agencies .
`` It 's very costly and time - consuming , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Phil Rosen</ENAMEX> , a partner in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fleet -AMP- Leasing Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Boston</ENAMEX> car - leasing company .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> senior executive at his firm spends <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">nearly 20 %</ENAMEX> of his time on insurance , he says .
Other forms of red tape are more pervasive .
The most onerous , many entrepreneurs say , is the record - keeping and filing required by tax authorities .
Complying with environmental and workplace regulations runs a close <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> .
But gripes run the gamut .
Here is the red tape that irks surveyed business owners the most :
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS :
Next to medical insurance , `` costs of compliance '' are the fastest - growing expense at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Impco Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Providence</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">R.I.</ENAMEX> , chemical company .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Gebhard</ENAMEX> , the company 's owner , says spending on regulatory paper work and the people to do it -- mostly to comply with federal , state and local environmental laws -- will rise <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">almost 30 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> to $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">100,000</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gebhard</ENAMEX> adds that spending on environmental red tape amounts to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">between 6.5 % and 7.5 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Impco</ENAMEX> 's total operating expenses .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Eastern Reproduction Corp.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Waltham</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , maker of thin metal precision parts , must report to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> federal and state agencies as well as to local fire , police , hospital and plumbing authorities , says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Maguire</ENAMEX> , president .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> state environmental regulator returned a report because `` it was n't heavy enough , it could n't have been correct , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maguire</ENAMEX> says .
WITHHOLDING RULES :
Employers must deposit withholding taxes exceeding $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3,000</ENAMEX> within <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">three days</ENAMEX> after payroll -- or pay stiff penalties -- and that 's a big problem for small businesses .
It 's especially nettlesome `` if you 're on the road and you 're the one responsible , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eddie Brown</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Brown Capital Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Baltimore</ENAMEX> money - management firm .
EMPLOYEE MANUALS :
Revising employee manuals on pensions , health care and other subjects costs <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">over $ 25,000</ENAMEX> a year for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bert Giguiere</ENAMEX> , president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Professional Agricultural Management Inc.</ENAMEX> , a <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fresno</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , provider of business services to farmers .
An employer leaves itself open to a great deal of liability if its employee manuals do n't reflect the most recent laws , he says .
But the ever - changing laws are usually so complicated and confusing that `` you need professionals to help you ; you ca n't do it yourself , '' he adds .
PENSION AND PROFIT - SHARING RULES :
Complying with these is enough to make business owners look forward to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">their own pension days</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Yearly</ENAMEX> changes in federal benefit laws force small businesses to repeatedly re-evaluate and redesign existing plans .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alice Fixx</ENAMEX> , who runs her own public - relations concern in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> , says she has had to overhaul her pension and profit - sharing plans <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> times in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past three years</ENAMEX> .
`` It does n't increase benefits , but it 's costly and time - consuming , '' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fixx</ENAMEX> says .
Compliance added <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 % to 20 %</ENAMEX> to her accounting bill <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> , she says .
SALES TAX RECORDS :
Advertising agencies and other service companies are exempt from city and state sales tax in most locales -- but the exemption comes at a price of exhaustive records and rigorous reviews .
To justify their exempt status and avoid penalties , these businesses must show once a year that each and every transaction on which they did n't pay sales tax was a legitimate business expense .
`` You need <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> person to just take care of sales tax , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennie Tong</ENAMEX> , executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lee Liu -AMP- Tong Advertising Inc.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> .
