<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">The verdict , reached * late last week in <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Cincinnati</COREF> ,</COREF> may end an eight - year legal battle for <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the Greensboro , N.C. , carpet maker</COREF> .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">Glenn and Sharon Beebe of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Cincinnati</COREF></COREF> had sued <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the com - pany</COREF> in 1981 after *PRO*-1 installing <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Burlington</COREF> carpets</COREF> in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> office .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">The Beebes</COREF> alleged that toxic fumes from <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the carpets</COREF> made <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> sick .
As a result of <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> illness , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the Beebes</COREF> said 0 *?* , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> lost $ 1.8 million *U* in wages and earnings .
In addition , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> said that months of exposure to the chemicals has left <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 sensitive to a wide range of commonly used substances .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">The case</COREF> had been closely watched *-1 because attorneys anticipate increasing litigation nationally over <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the so - called sick - building syndrome</COREF> .
Plaintiffs ' lawyers say that buildings become `` sick '' when inadequate fresh air and poor ventilation systems lead pollutants *PRO*-2 to build up inside *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Anthony J. Iaciofano</COREF> , <COREF ID="85" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a lawyer for <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Burlington</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> believes 0 <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the Beebes '</COREF> symptoms</COREF> were not related to <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the carpeting</COREF> .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said that <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">ill effects</COREF> from new carpets</COREF> manifest <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> immediately but that <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the Beebes '</COREF> symptoms</COREF> appeared months later .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="82" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Catherine Adams</COREF> , <COREF ID="82" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the Beebes '</COREF> lawyer</COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the verdict</COREF> would not discourage other plaintiffs from *PRO*-1 filing such suits .
Scientists are only beginning *-2 to understand what *T*-1 causes <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">sick - building syndrome</COREF> and much of that research was unavailable when <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the Beebes</COREF> filed <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> *T*-3 , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> said 0 *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">The Beebes</COREF> now believe that a prime culprit for <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> injuries was fumes from an adhesive used * in <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the carpeting</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the Beebes</COREF> did n't come to that conclusion until time limits *ICH*-2 had elapsed for *PRO* adding the adhesives maker as a defendant in <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Adams</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">The Beebes</COREF> have not yet decided whether *PRO*-1 to appeal .
TIMES SQUARE development opponents are dealt *-1 setback .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">The Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court</COREF> dismissed six lawsuits attempting *PRO* to block <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">a $ 2.5 billion *U* project planned * for 42nd Street in Manhattan</COREF> .
Opponents of <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the project</COREF> had claimed that the city and the state of New York , which *T*-1 are co-sponsoring <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the project</COREF> , had failed *-2 to adhere to environmental guidelines .
All but <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">two</COREF> of the 40 or so lawsuits that *T*-3 have been filed *-2 since <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the project 's</COREF> 1984 approval have been dismissed *-1 before the trial stage .
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">The two that *T*-1 remain</COREF> have n't yet reached the pre-trial fact - finding stage .

`` <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">This project</COREF> is ready *PRO*-2 to move , '' said *T*-1 State Urban Development Corp. Chairman Vincent Tese .
But <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">developers of four planned office towers</COREF> cautioned that obstacles still remain .
As part of the agreement with the state , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the developers</COREF> -- <COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a partnership of Park Tower Realty and Prudential Insurance Co. of America</COREF> --</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would not proceed with condemnation proceedings while there was `` significant litigation '' pending .
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Park Tower General Counsel Matthew Mayer</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the development team</COREF> will have *-1 to review two additional lawsuits before *PRO*-2 putting up a $ 155 million *U* letter of credit 0 *T*-3 to cover condemnation costs .
Also , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *?* , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the partnership</COREF> is waiting *PRO*-3 to see whether <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the appellate division 's</COREF> ruling</COREF> will be appealed *-1 .
The plan , which *T*-2 has been plagued *-1 with delays and business - related setbacks , seeks *PRO*-3 to transform <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the area</COREF> from a seedy thoroughfare to a more wholesome office and theater district .

A magistrate had initially refused the request , *PRO*-1 ruling that <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the attack</COREF> had been a political act for which <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the man</COREF> , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mahmoud El - Abed Ahmad</COREF> ,</COREF> would be exempt from extradition *T*-2 .
However , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Judge Weinstein</COREF> wrote in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> opinion late last month that terrorism and acts of war against civilians can not be defined *-1 as political acts .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Judge Weinstein</COREF> also ruled that judges must consider prior to extradition whether the defendant will be treated *-1 fairly in a foreign court .
*PRO*-1 To do so , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the judge</COREF> said 0 *?* , the U.S. courts must review the judicial process in the foreign country independently of <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the State Department 's</COREF> assessment .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said that in <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> concurred with <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the State Department 's</COREF> decision that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ahmad</COREF> should be extradited *-1 .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ahmad 's</COREF> lawyer</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would appeal .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Lawyers close to <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF></COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> believed 0 <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the ruling</COREF> was unprecedented .
`` Up until now <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the courts</COREF> have said 0 it *EXP*-2 is not <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> role *PRO* to supervise the foreign country 's courts , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="95" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jacques Semmelman</COREF> , <COREF ID="95" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the assistant U.S. attorney on <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF></COREF> .

QUOTABLE :
In a speech prepared * for delivery in New York yesterday , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">retired Justice Lewis Powell</COREF> contested the notion that the last <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> term marked a turn toward conservatism : `` Commentators who *T*-1 agreed on little else unanimously <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">proclaimed</COREF> a ` shift in direction ' on <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> ... .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> take <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">these pronouncements</COREF> , like many that *T*-1 have preceded <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in past years , with a grain of salt .
In an era of ` sound bites ' and instant opinion polls it *EXP*-3 is dangerous *PRO* to apply broad labels to a single term .
