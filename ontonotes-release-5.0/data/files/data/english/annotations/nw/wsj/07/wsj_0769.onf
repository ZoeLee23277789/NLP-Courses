    Unless Mr. Lawson's resignation leads to a change in British interest-rate policy--Mrs. Thatcher's administration firmly
    supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check--or posturing toward full inclusion in the European Monetary
    System's exchange-rate mechanism, Mr. Lawson's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates, Mr.
