Deeply ingrained in both the book review `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Kissing Nature Good - bye</ENAMEX> '' by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stephen MacDonald</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Leisure -AMP- Arts</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 27</ENAMEX> -RRB- and the books reviewed is the assumption that global warming is entirely a result of human activity .
Is such a view justified ?
In the absence of humans , would the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Earth</ENAMEX> enjoy a constant climate over the long term ?
Clearly not .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">About 20,000 years ago</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the last ice age</ENAMEX> ended .
Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">North America</ENAMEX> , northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Asia</ENAMEX> .
This global warming must have been entirely natural -- nobody would blame it on <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a few hundred thousand</ENAMEX> hunter - gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves .
Furthermore , no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming .
It is probably continuing and may well account for most of , or all of , present - day global warming .
I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage , but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist - exploiters - greedy - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> - consumers - global - warming scenario as the sole model for discussion .
