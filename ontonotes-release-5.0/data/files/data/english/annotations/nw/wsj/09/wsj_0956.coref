In a corner of the cavernous , new Nippon Convention Center sits *T*-1 <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Mazda Motor Corp. 's</COREF> advanced - technology display</COREF> .
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The highlight</COREF> : <COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a `` fragrance control system</COREF> . ''</COREF>
With the touch of a button , drivers can choose from <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">lavender , jasmine , mint or perfume scents</COREF> , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF> blown *-1 in through the car 's air - conditioning system .
The soft , wafting aromas will `` improve ride comfort , '' <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the display</COREF> attests 0 *T*-1 , and a proud employee says 0 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Mazda</COREF> hopes *PRO*-2 to move <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the system</COREF> out of the lab and into <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> cars in a year or two .
*PRO* Welcome to <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the 28th Tokyo Motor Show</COREF> .
Here you can find <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Mitsubishi Motors Corp. displaying <COREF ID="87" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a `` live fish transporter</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="87" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a truck akin to an aquarium on wheels</COREF> ,</COREF> and <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Nissan Motor Co. with its `` keyless '' Boga , whose doors *T*-1 unlock upon *PRO*-2 recognizing the owner 's fingerprints</COREF> .
Suzuki Motor Co. 's Escudome sport vehicle features a pop - out rear tent and invites drivers *PRO*-1 to go `` back to the nature . ''
But <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">this biennial event</COREF> , <COREF ID="88" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the world 's largest display of cars and trucks</COREF> ,</COREF> has <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> serious side , including the first major exhibitions of future engines and vehicle - suspension systems .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's also the prime showcase for <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">a country whose world dominance in the industry *T*-1 is increasingly acknowledged *-3</COREF> , and therein lies *T*-2 the draw .
Even the biggest auto shows in <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> are largely regional affairs , but <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> show</COREF> is international .
Virtually every automotive analyst in New York showed up .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Detroit</COREF> - to - <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> flights were booked *-1 solid this week as <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Motor City</COREF> executives , including <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Ford Motor Co.</COREF> Chairman Donald E. Petersen and <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Chrysler Corp.</COREF> Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald , flocked *PRO*-2 to see the future .
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">Even the Soviet Union</COREF> came , for the first time in 24 years , *PRO*-1 to show off <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Lada Niva sedan and <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> futuristic dark - blue `` Kompakt '' model .
Here 's *T*-3 a firsthand look at what the Japanese hosts sported *T*-1 , and what the foreign visitors saw *T*-2 .
New Technology
The hottest displays were <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">items that *T*-1 insulate passengers from bumps , potholes and other rigors of the road</COREF> .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">These `` active suspension systems ''</COREF> electronically sense road conditions and adjust a car 's ride .
Existing suspension systems try *PRO*-1 to absorb <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">bounces</COREF> , but active suspension provides power *PRO* to counter <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the jolts</COREF> .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Nissan</COREF> , in a 34 - page tract , modestly compares <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> `` hydraulic active suspension '' to <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">a cheetah</COREF> , and equates the various parts to <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the animal 's</COREF> heart , brain , nerves and blood vessels .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Toyota Motor Corp.</COREF> grandly touted <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> system in a car that *T*-1 splits in half *PRO* to reveal the suspension 's inner workings .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Nissan</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will introduce <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> first system next month on the Infiniti Q45 luxury sedan , and <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Toyota 's</COREF> Celica coupe will go on sale with the suspension device next spring .
But drivers in <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> must wait : <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">The Japanese</COREF> , for now , are keeping active suspension for domestic use only .
And <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Detroit 's</COREF> Big Three auto makers</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> systems are still under development .
In the engine department , several companies displayed experimental models that within a decade *T*-1 could provide power equal to today 's engines and yet take up only half the space , *PRO* allowing for shorter hoods .
In the so - called two - stroke engines , which *T*-1 are expected *-2 to get sharply higher gas mileage , each piston goes up and down only once *PRO* to provide power .
By contrast , the pistons in conventional four - stroke engines must move up and down twice in each power cycle .
The two - stroke engine displays by Toyota and <COREF ID="102" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Fuji Heavy Industries</COREF> , <COREF ID="102" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the maker of Subaru cars</COREF> , drew plenty of interest from U.S. auto executives , who *T*-1 are rushing *PRO*-2 to develop two - stroke engines .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Honda Motor Co.</COREF> shows <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">a more conventional five - cylinder engine</COREF> in the new Accord Inspire model , which *T*-1 made its debut just this month -- in <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> only .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Honda</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the five - cylinder engine</COREF> provides a compromise between the fuel - economy of a four - cylinder , and the power of a V - 6 .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is rumored *-2 to be bound *-1 for a new model in the luxury Acura line in <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> , but <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Honda</COREF> officials would n't comment .
Odd Cars , Funny Names
There 's plenty of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">whimsy</COREF> here , but it *EXP*-1 is n't always clear whether <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's intentional .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">The show 's</COREF> symbol is a woman riding on a snail , not your usual metaphor for speed and agility .
But <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the sponsors</COREF> have an explanation : `` Through the character associated * with a snail , '' <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say *?* , `` important values such as harmony with nature and aspirations for the future are sought *-2 . ''
Japanese auto makers are known *-1 for *PRO*-3 coming up with funny names , but this year the practice seems *-2 to have reached a new high -- or low .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Honda</COREF> has a tiny motorcycle called * *PRO*-1 the Monkey , and <COREF ID="91" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a slightly larger cousin</COREF> , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Gorilla</COREF> .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Mitsubishi</COREF> has a futuristic delivery truck called * *PRO*-1 the Guppy .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Mazda</COREF> has the Bongo truck and , under <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Autozam nameplate , a `` microvan '' called * *PRO*-2 the Scrum .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> buglike Carol minicar is `` designed *-1 with softness , gentleness and warmheartedness . ''
But the court jester appears *-1 to be <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Japan 's</COREF> smallest car maker</COREF> , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Daihatsu Motor Co</COREF></COREF> .
One of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> futuristic concepts is the bubblelike Sneaker , which *T*-1 seats just one person in front and could hold a small child and bag of groceries in the rear .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Daihatsu</COREF> also has the Fellow 90 , the Leeza Spider and the Hijet Dumbo .
The jokes are n't just on <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese</COREF> , though .
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Regie Nationale des Usines Renault</COREF> , <COREF ID="94" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the French auto maker</COREF> , has a concept car called * *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Megane</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">The name</COREF> is supposed *-1 to connote feminine grandeur , but in Japanese <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> means `` eyeglasses . ''
Foreign Presence
Foreign auto makers are taking <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the Tokyo Motor Show</COREF> more seriously than ever .
AB Volvo invites passers - by *PRO*-3 to play `` the role of the test dummy '' by *PRO*-4 hopping in a car that *T*-1 simulates a crash *PRO*-5 to show just how its seat - belt tightener works *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Hyundai Motor Co.</COREF> of South Korea</COREF> has <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> first - ever exhibit in <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">General Motors Corp.</COREF> is sponsoring <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> first independent display in 10 years</COREF> , and <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> includes a boxy Buick station wagon with wood - grain side panels .
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Ford</COREF> and <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Chrysler</COREF></COREF> also have exhibits , although <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">theirs</COREF> are tucked *-1 in a separate room with the less - popular automotive parts section .
`` <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've got *-1 to get out of the <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Detroit</COREF> mentality and be part of the world mentality , '' declares *T*-2 *ICH*-4 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Charles M. Jordan</COREF> , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">GM 's</COREF> vice president for design</COREF></COREF> , in *PRO*-3 explaining <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> pilgrimage to <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the Tokyo Show</COREF> .
Even so , traditional American cockiness is n't terribly endangered *-1 .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Ford</COREF> officials , for example , crowed about <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> first - ever Tokyo Grand Prix racing victory .
True , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Ford</COREF> was declared *-1 the winner Sunday , but only after the <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">Honda</COREF> driver who *T*-3 crossed the finish line first was disqualified *-2 because it hit another car and skid momentarily out of bounds .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Jordan of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">GM</COREF></COREF> , meanwhile , still criticizes Japanese styling .
`` It *EXP*-1 's hard for <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *?* , `` *PRO* to get a feeling in a car , to get a passion in a car , to get emotion in a car .
