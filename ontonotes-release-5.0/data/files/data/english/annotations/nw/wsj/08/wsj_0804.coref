<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">An enormous turtle</COREF> has succeeded where the government has failed *T*-1 : <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has made *PRO* speaking <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF> respectable .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The 6 1/2 - foot - tall turtle</COREF> , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Pong Pagong</COREF> ,</COREF> is a character who *T*-1 stars in <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the children 's television show `` Batibot</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> speaks only in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF> .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">`` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Batibot</COREF> , '' which *T*-1 started in 1983 as a hybrid of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. program `` Sesame Street</COREF> , ''</COREF> has developed into a distinctly Philippine effort .
Radio programs and books have followed <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the daily television show</COREF> .
In the process , `` <COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Batibot</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an archaic Filipino word meaning `` strong '' or `` enduring</COREF> , '' has become <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">a powerful advocate of the use of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the Filipino language</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> impresses on <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">ordinary , young Filipinos</COREF> that there 's nothing 0 *PRO* to feel inferior about *T*-1 in *PRO* using <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own language</COREF> , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Randy David</COREF> , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show</COREF> .
`` When we started <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> six years ago *T*-1 , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the use</COREF> of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF></COREF> was deemed *-2 unwise by the predominantly middle class , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lydia Brown</COREF> , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the program 's</COREF> creator</COREF></COREF> .
Now , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says 0 *?* , `` <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's no longer an issue . ''
The success of `` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Batibot</COREF> '' stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts *PRO* to promote <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF> as a national language .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF> -- once known * as Pilipino -- is predominantly <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tagalog</COREF> , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Malay - based language spoken * in a part of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> principal island of Luzon</COREF></COREF> .
Resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> elite , who *T*-1 generally prefer <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> .
But while <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">better - off Filipinos</COREF> are quick *PRO*-1 to cite the logic in *PRO* using a language as widespread as <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are often slow *PRO*-2 to reveal that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are prejudiced against <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF> , say 0 *T*-3 advocates of the native language .
`` For the middle and upper - middle class -LCB- <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF> -RCB- is declasse , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Bien Lumbera</COREF> , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Philippine - studies professor at Quezon City 's University of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the Philippines</COREF></COREF> .
There 's also resentment .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Other opponents</COREF> of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF></COREF> come from <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">non-Tagalog</COREF> regions .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> argue that <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own languages should have equal weight , although recent surveys indicate that the majority of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> population understands <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF> more than any other language .
-LRB- There are seven major languages and more than 70 dialects in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> . -RRB-
What tongue *PRO* to speak *T*-1 is an emotional mine field in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the Philippines</COREF> .
It is entrenched *-1 in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> colonial bonds to <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> , in Philippine class structure , in the regional loyalties of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> people and in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> island geography .
As <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did *?* when <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the Philippines</COREF> was a colony of <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">teachers</COREF> for the most part teach in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> , even though <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a foreign language for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">most Philippine children</COREF> .
As a result , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> often speak one language at home , <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">another</COREF> at school .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Brown</COREF> calls <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the modern - day cultural ambivalence to <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-1 a `` language schizophrenia . ''
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">The issue</COREF> has been simmering for years .
It *EXP*-1 does n't take much *PRO* to provoke an intense debate .
When President Corazon Aquino , whose command of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF> *T*-1 is spotty , announced last year that <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the language</COREF> would be used * in official communications *T*-2 , there was an uproar from many legislators , who *T*-3 continue *-4 to conduct debates mostly in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">many proponents of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF></COREF> see resistance to <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the language</COREF> finally crumbling .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> believe 0 the media , including `` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Batibot</COREF> , '' have played a crucial role .
According to <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">chief scriptwriter Rene Villanueva</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Batibot</COREF> '' does n't set out *PRO*-1 to advance the cause of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Filipino</COREF> .
`` It 's not as if we 're teaching <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">language</COREF> per se , '' <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *?* , `` We 're just using <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> . ''
These days , `` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Batibot</COREF> '' is produced *-1 in a converted lumberyard on a shoestring budget of $ 3,000 *U* a one - hour segment .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is shown *-1 weekdays on two of <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> five networks .
With an audience totaling more than 400,000 , `` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Batibot</COREF> '' consistently ranks in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the country 's</COREF> top - four most - watched daytime programs .
But advertising revenue is inadequate .
Periodically , there are threats that <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> will fold .
`` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Batibot</COREF> '' lacks the polish of `` <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Sesame Street</COREF> . ''
Sound stages echo .
Acting sometimes falls flat .
There are <COREF ID="73" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">only two large puppets in <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF></COREF> : <COREF ID="73" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Pong Pagong</COREF> and a monkey named Kiko Matsing</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the production</COREF> is the equal of any local program .
And <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the show 's</COREF> creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">The program</COREF> is n't afraid *PRO*-1 to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment .
Not that the language war is won *-1 , even on `` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Batibot</COREF> . ''
During one recent episode , all the advertisements were in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> .
