As an actor , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lane</ENAMEX> is n't the inheritor of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charlie Chaplin 's</ENAMEX> spirit .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Martin</ENAMEX> has already laid his claim to that .
But it is Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> , as movie director , producer and writer , who has been obsessed with refitting <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaplin</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little Tramp</ENAMEX> in a contemporary way .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1976</ENAMEX> , as a film student at the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Purchase</ENAMEX> campus of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the State University of New York</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> shot `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A Place in Time</ENAMEX> , '' a <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">36 - minute</ENAMEX> black - and - white film about a sketch artist , a man of the streets .
Now , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">13 years later</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> has revived his Artist in a full - length movie called `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sidewalk Stories</ENAMEX> , '' a poignant piece of work about a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">modern - day</ENAMEX> tramp .
Of course , if the film contained dialogue , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> 's Artist would be called a homeless person .
So would <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Little Tramp</ENAMEX> , for that matter .
I say `` contained dialogue '' because `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sidewalk Stories</ENAMEX> '' is n't really silent at all .
Composer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Marder</ENAMEX> , a college friend of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> 's who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would .
Much of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> 's film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets -LRB- though probably no more romanticized than Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaplin</ENAMEX> 's notion of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tramp</ENAMEX> as the good - hearted free spirit -RRB- .
Filmed in lovely black and white by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Dill</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> streets of `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sidewalk Stories</ENAMEX> '' seem benign .
On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs .
The Artist hangs out in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Greenwich Village</ENAMEX> , on a strip of <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Sixth Avenue</ENAMEX> populated by jugglers , magicians and other good - natured hustlers .
-LRB- This clearly is not real life : no crack dealers , no dead - eyed men selling <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - year - old</ENAMEX> copies of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Cosmopolitan</ENAMEX> , no one curled up in a cardboard box . -RRB-
The Artist has his routine .
He spends <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">his days</ENAMEX> sketching passers - by , or trying to .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> he returns to the condemned building he calls home .
His life , including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist , seems carefree .
He is his own man .
Then , just as the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tramp</ENAMEX> is given a blind girl to cure in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">City Lights</ENAMEX> , '' the Artist is put in charge of returning a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two - year - old</ENAMEX> waif -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicole Alysia</ENAMEX> -RRB- , whose father has been murdered by thugs , to her mother .
This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse .
She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life .
The beds at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bowery Mission</ENAMEX> seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> .
To further load the stakes , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman who owns her own children 's shop and who lives in an expensive high - rise apartment building .
This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lane</ENAMEX> 's final purpose is n't to glamorize the Artist 's vagabond existence .
He has a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force .
The movie ends with sound , the sound of street people talking , and there is n't anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> film maker <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Claude Chabrol</ENAMEX> has managed another kind of weird achievement with his `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Story of Women</ENAMEX> . ''
He has made a harsh , brilliant picture -- one that 's captivating -- about a character who , viewed from the most sympathetic angle , would seem disagreeable .
Yet this woman , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie - Louise Giraud</ENAMEX> , carries historical significance , both as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the last women to be executed in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> and as a symbol of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vichy</ENAMEX> government 's hypocrisy .
While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Vichy</ENAMEX> collaborated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Germans</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> in the deaths of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Resistance</ENAMEX> fighters and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jews</ENAMEX> , its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie - Louise</ENAMEX> , a small - time abortionist , was their woman .
She became an abortionist accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war - rationed goodies .
She was untrained and , in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> botched job killed a client .
Her remorse was shallow and brief .
Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war - damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home .
As presented by Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chabrol</ENAMEX> , and played with thin - lipped intensity by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Isabelle Huppert</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie - Louise</ENAMEX> -LRB- called <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marie Latour</ENAMEX> in the film -RRB- was not a nice person .
But she did n't deserve to have her head chopped off .
There is very little to recommend `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Old Gringo</ENAMEX> , '' a confused rendering of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carlos Fuentes</ENAMEX> novel of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Mexican Revolution</ENAMEX> .
Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory .
I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Peck</ENAMEX> , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die .
Video Tip : Before seeing `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Sidewalk Stories</ENAMEX> , '' take a look at `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">City Lights</ENAMEX> , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chaplin</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tramp</ENAMEX> at his finest .
