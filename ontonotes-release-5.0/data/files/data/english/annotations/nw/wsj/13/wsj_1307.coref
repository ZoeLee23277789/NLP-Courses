In a startling turnabout , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">Members of <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate Intelligence Committee</COREF></COREF> are complaining that <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">someone in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the executive branch</COREF></COREF> is leaking on <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">David Boren</COREF> , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Intelligence Committee</COREF> chairman</COREF> ,</COREF> is upset that someone leaked a letter to <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> from the Reagan administration suggesting that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> would undertake *PRO*-2 to warn <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Panamanian thug Manuel Noriega</COREF> if <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> got wind of an impending coup that *T*-1 might result in <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> assassination .
With due respect to `` highly classified correspondence '' and other buzzwords , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the leakers</COREF> are performing a public service .
If <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> has become a protection service for <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> , the American people ought *-1 to know .
What *T*-1 went wrong in Panama is a fitting subject for public and congressional inquiry .
Naturally , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Senator Boren</COREF> and <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> committee</COREF></COREF> would like free rein 0 *PRO* to blame <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the executive branch</COREF> *T*-1 while *PRO*-2 stamping `` top secret '' on <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own complicity .
But there 's no danger of *PRO* exposing sources and methods in *PRO* disclosing <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the debate running up and down Pennsylvania Avenue</COREF> .
And if <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> is going *-1 to assume authority *PRO* to micromanage foreign policy , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's going *-2 to have *-3 to take some of the responsibility too .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">The President of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF></COREF> urged <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the Panamanian armed forces</COREF> *PRO*-1 to move against <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> .
When <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did *?* *T*-1 , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> commanders did n't have the initiative 0 *PRO* to do more than *PRO*-3 block a couple of roads *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">The executive branch</COREF> bears the first responsibility for timidity .
But what kind of initiative can you expect *T*-1 given the climate set * by <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> ?
For example , what exactly did <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> tell <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Major Giroldi</COREF> and <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fellow coup plotters *T*-1 about U.S. laws and executive orders on assassinations ?
What part did U.S. warnings play *T*-1 in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the major 's</COREF> unwillingness *PRO* to pull the trigger when <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">General Noriega</COREF> in custody , but was under attack by <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">pro-Noriega</COREF> troops *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> did n't suffer from any hesitation once <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had the pistol .
Maybe we need a <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">CIA</COREF> version of the Miranda warning : You have the right *PRO* to conceal your coup intentions , because we may rat on you .
Or maybe a Surgeon General 's warning : *PRO* Confiding in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> may be fatal .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">CIA</COREF> chief William Webster , hardly a <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> malcontent ,</COREF> got <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the debate</COREF> started *-2 last week by *PRO*-1 noting that <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the executive order banning assassinations</COREF> had contributed to U.S. paralysis during the coup .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">The CIA 's</COREF> Deputy Director of Operations</COREF> , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Richard Stoltz</COREF> ,</COREF> tried *PRO*-1 to smooth things over a few days later , but instead simply underlined <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Webster 's</COREF> point .
`` The interpretation '' of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the executive order</COREF> , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Stoltz</COREF> said 0 *?* , `` and the way in which the various committees have over time interpreted <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 , has led in <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> view to a proper caution on the part of operators , including <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> . ''
In other words , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> wo n't let <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> do much of anything anymore , and that 's fine with <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> .
The pay 's the same , and the duty 's lighter .
And of course , *PRO* doing anything that *T*-2 might be second - guessed *-1 by <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> carries heavy penalties .
*PRO* Witness the Walsh prosecution of Ollie North .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">The Intelligence Committee 's</COREF> ranking Republican</COREF> , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Senator William Cohen</COREF> ,</COREF> joined with Senator George Mitchell *PRO*-1 to write a best seller about Iran - Contra , deploring `` <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Men</COREF> of Zeal</COREF> . ''
No doubt many people in <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> , the Pentagon and the National Security Council have read <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
What kind of initiative should anyone expect *T*-3 from people out on the line who *T*-1 've read all this and know what *T*-2 can happen if they fail ?
Who *T*-1 wants *PRO*-2 to end up as the protagonist in a <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Bill Cohen</COREF> morality play ?
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The order against assassinations</COREF> is <COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">another artifact</COREF> of the same congressional mind - set , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a product of the 1970s Vietnam syndrome against any executive action</COREF> .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> would do <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> a favor by *PRO*-1 rescinding <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the order</COREF> as an ambiguous intrusion on <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> ability *PRO* to defend <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">America 's</COREF> national security .
There are of course good reasons 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> should n't get into the assassination business *T*-1 , but *PRO* rescinding <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the executive order</COREF> is not the same thing as *PRO* saying 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> should start *-2 passing out exploding cigars .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The world</COREF> being the nasty place 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-1 , we want Presidents to have the freedom 0 *PRO* to order operations in which someone might get killed *-4 *T*-3 *T*-2 .
In such situations , you can not write rules in advance , you can only make sure 0 the President takes the responsibility .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The executive order</COREF> and the reported agreements with <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the Intelligence Committee</COREF> are neither sensible nor moral .
As it now stands , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> can bomb Tripoli , but ca n't `` assassinate '' Colonel Gadhafi .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> can send a fighter squadron *PRO*-1 to strafe terrorist hideouts in the Bekaa Valley , but ca n't shoot Abu Nidal .
Both <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the assassination order</COREF> and the quality of debate in <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> are telling the world that the only way 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> will kill <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">a madman</COREF> *T*-1 is by *PRO* making sure 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> take some innocent civilians with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
