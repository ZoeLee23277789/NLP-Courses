<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">The Justice Department</COREF> has <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">revised</COREF> certain internal guidelines and <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">clarified</COREF> others in a move that *T*-1 could restrict the use of criminal racketeering charges against white - collar defendants .
The most significant changes in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">department policy</COREF> are new requirements that federal prosecutors avoid *PRO*-1 disrupting `` the normal business functions '' of companies charged * under the racketeering law , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">a senior department official</COREF> said 0 *T*-2 .
Another important revision of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">department policy</COREF> is a new guideline warning prosecutors `` *PRO*-3 not to take steps that *T*-1 would harm innocent third parties '' in a case brought * under <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the racketeering law</COREF> , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the official</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">David Runkel</COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">The department</COREF> distributed the <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">revisions</COREF> and <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">clarifications</COREF> to U.S. attorneys around the country this summer as part of a routine process of *PRO* updating prosecutorial guidelines , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Runkel</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 .
The changes apply to prosecutions brought * under <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law</COREF> .
Under <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">that law</COREF> , defendants who *T*-1 allegedly commit a pattern of crimes by means of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">a `` criminal enterprise ''</COREF> may be charged *-2 with racketeering and forced *-2 *PRO*-3 to forfeit the proceeds of <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the enterprise</COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">The RICO law</COREF> has come under criticism from <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">some defendants and defense lawyers</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> argue that the rights of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> defendants and third parties not named * in <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> indictments have been unfairly damaged *-1 .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">The department 's</COREF> most significant clarification of existing <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> policy is <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">a directive *ICH*-1 to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">prosecutors</COREF> that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">seek</COREF> *PRO*-2 to seize assets from defendants `` in proportion '' to the nature of <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the alleged offense</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Runkel</COREF> said 0 *T*-3 .
`` <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> means that if <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the offense</COREF> deals with one part of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the business</COREF> , you do n't attempt *PRO*-1 to seize <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the whole business</COREF> ; you attempt *PRO*-2 to seize assets related * to <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the crime</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> explained *T*-3 .
In general , the thrust of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the department 's</COREF> directive</COREF> is *PRO* to encourage prosecutors *PRO*-4 to limit pretrial asset seizures if there are less intrusive means of *PRO* protecting assets 0 the government may subsequently be able *PRO*-3 to seize *T*-2 after a conviction , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Runkel</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 .
