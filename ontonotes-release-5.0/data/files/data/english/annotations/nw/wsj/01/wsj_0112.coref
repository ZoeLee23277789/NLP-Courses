<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> learned during <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration</COREF> that <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could intimidate <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the executive branch</COREF> by *PRO*-1 uttering again and again the same seven words : `` Provided , that no funds shall be spent *-48 ... . ''
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">This phrase</COREF> once again is found *-49 throughout <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the many appropriations bills now moving through <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> signals <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress 's</COREF> attempt *ICH*-1 , under the pretext of *PRO* guarding <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the public purse</COREF> , *PRO* to deny <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> the funding necessary *PRO* to execute certain of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> duties and prerogatives specified * in <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II of <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF></COREF> .
This species of congressional action is predicated *-50 on <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">an interpretation of <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations clause</COREF> that *T*-1 is erroneous and unconstitutional</COREF> .
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">The appropriations clause</COREF> states that `` No Money shall be drawn *-51 from the Treasury , but in Consequence of Appropriations made * by Law ... . ''
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">The prevailing interpretation of <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">the clause</COREF> on Capitol Hill</COREF> is that <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> gives <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> an omnipresent veto over every conceivable action of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> through the ability *PRO* to withhold funding .
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">This interpretation</COREF> was officially endorsed *-1 by <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> in 1987 in the Iran - Contra Report .
As partisans of congressional power understand , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">a `` power of <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the purse</COREF> '' so broadly construed *</COREF> would emasculate <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the presidency</COREF> and swallow the principle of separation of powers .
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is not supported by the text or history of <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF> .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">The framers</COREF> hardly discussed <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations clause</COREF> at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 , according to <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Madison 's</COREF> notes .
To the extent 0 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> concern was *PRO*-1 to ensure fiscal accountability .
Moreover , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the framers</COREF> believed that <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> needed a unitary executive with the independence and resources 0 *PRO* to perform the executive functions that the Confederation Congress had performed *T*-2 poorly under the Articles of Confederation *T*-1 .
It would contradict that objective if <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="158" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the appropriations clause</COREF> -LRB- technically <COREF ID="158" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a limitation on legislative power</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> could be read *-52 as *PRO*-52 placing <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> on <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress 's</COREF> short leash , *PRO*-52 making <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the executive</COREF> consist of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> and every member of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> went to the conference panel now deliberating , <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations bill for <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the executive office of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF></COREF> for <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">fiscal 1990</COREF></COREF> contained <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">some breathtaking attempts *ICH*-1 by <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> *PRO* to rewrite <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF> under the pretext of *PRO* protecting <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">the public 's money</COREF></COREF> .
During the coming weeks , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> must decide whether *PRO* to veto <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the bills containing <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> -- or , alternatively , *PRO* to sign <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">these bills</COREF> into law with a statement declaring <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> intrusions on executive power to be in violation of <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II</COREF> , and thus void and severable .
<COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">The 1990 appropriations legislation</COREF> attempts *PRO*-1 to strip <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> powers *PRO* to make certain appointments as *PRO* provided *-2 by <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II</COREF> .
<COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II</COREF> places on <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> the duty *PRO* to nominate *RNR*-1 , `` and by and with the Advice and Consent of <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> '' appoint *RNR*-1 , ambassadors , judges , and other officers of <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> .
<COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also empowers <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> *PRO*-41 to make recess appointments , without <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> approval : `` <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The President</COREF> shall have Power *PRO* to fill up all Vacancies that *T*-1 may happen during the Recess of <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> , by *PRO*-2 granting Commissions which *T*-40 shall expire at the End of <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> next Session . ''
Yet <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Section 605 of <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations bill for <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the executive office</COREF></COREF></COREF> provides : `` No part of any appropriation for the current fiscal year contained * in this or any other Act shall be paid *-53 to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">any person</COREF> for the filling of any position for which <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">he or she</COREF> has been nominated *-54 *T*-1 after <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> has voted *PRO*-2 not to approve the nomination of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">said person</COREF> . ''
Thus , with one brief passage in <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">an appropriations bill</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> repeals <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> power *PRO* to make recess appointments under <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II</COREF> .
<COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Section 605</COREF> also imposes unconstitutional conditions on <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> ability *PRO* to nominate candidates of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> choosing .
The language of <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations rider</COREF> implies that any nomination to any position of <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">a rejected nominee</COREF> will result in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> being denied *-55 funding 0 *PRO* to pay <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">that person 's</COREF> salary *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The president</COREF> could probably not avoid this restriction by *PRO*-1 choosing people willing *PRO* to <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">serve</COREF> without pay , because the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibits <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">voluntary service to the government</COREF> .
<COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">The 1990 appropriations bills</COREF> also contain a number of `` muzzling '' provisions that *T*-1 violate the recommendation clause in <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II of <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Muzzling provisions , which *T*-1 might be called *-56 *PRO*-57 `` blindfold laws '' as well ,</COREF> prevent <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the executive branch</COREF> from *PRO*-2 even looking at <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">certain policy options</COREF> , let alone from *PRO*-2 recommending <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> .
Such laws violate the provision in <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II</COREF> that *T*-1 requires <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> *PRO*-42 to make <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">recommendations</COREF> to <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> , but which *T*-41 gives <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> the discretion 0 *PRO* to select the subject matter of <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">those recommendations</COREF> *T*-2 .
Typically , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">these laws</COREF> seek *PRO*-1 to prevent executive branch officials from *PRO*-2 inquiring into whether certain federal programs make any economic sense or proposing more market - oriented alternatives to regulations .
Probably the most egregious example is a proviso in <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations bill for <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the executive office</COREF></COREF> that *T*-1 prevents <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> Office of Management and Budget from *PRO*-2 subjecting agricultural marketing orders to any cost - benefit scrutiny .
There is something inherently suspect about Congress 's prohibiting <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the executive</COREF> from *PRO*-1 even studying whether public funds are being wasted *-57 in some favored program or other .
Perhaps none of the unconstitutional conditions contained * in <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations bills for <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">fiscal 1990</COREF></COREF> better *ICH*-1 illustrates <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress 's</COREF> attempt *PRO* to usurp executive power than <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Section 609 of <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the executive - office bill</COREF> : `` None of the funds made *PRO* available *PRO* pursuant to the provisions of <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">this Act</COREF> shall be used *-2 *PRO* to implement , administer , or enforce any regulation which *T*-3 has been disapproved *-58 pursuant to a resolution of disapproval duly adopted * in accordance with the applicable law of <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF></COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">This provision</COREF> amounts to a legislative veto over <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> execution of the law , since <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">a one - house resolution</COREF> could be said *-1 to be `` duly adopted '' even though <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would require neither bicameral action in <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> nor presentation to <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> for <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> signature or veto .
<COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">The Supreme Court 's</COREF> decision in INS v. Chadha held that legislative vetoes are unconstitutional .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> should veto appropriations acts that *T*-1 contain these kinds of unconstitutional conditions on <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> ability *PRO* to discharge <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> duties and exercise <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> prerogatives .
If <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> fails *-1 to do so in <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first year , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will invite <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> , for the remainder of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> presidency , *PRO*-2 to rewrite <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II of <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-3 to suit <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> purposes .
What *T*-1 becomes custom in the <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration will only become more difficult 0 for future presidents , including Democrats , to undo *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">President Reagan</COREF> learned that lesson .
By 1987 , then - Speaker Jim Wright was discussing arms control in Moscow with Mikhail Gorbachev and then attempting *PRO*-1 to direct <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> , through an appropriations rider , *PRO*-2 to treat the Soviets as though <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF> had ratified SALT II .
If <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">a veto</COREF> is unworkable because <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would leave part of <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the executive branch</COREF> *PRO*-2 unfunded , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> could sign <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations bills</COREF> into law and assert a power of excision , *PRO*-1 declaring the rider restricting <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II</COREF> powers to be unconstitutional and severable .
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">The Constitution</COREF> does not expressly give <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> such power .
However , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> does have a duty *PRO* not to violate <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">the Constitution</COREF> .
The question is whether <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> only means of defense is the veto .
Excision of appropriations riders that *T*-1 trespass on <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> duties and prerogative under <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Article II</COREF> would be different from the line - item veto .
As *PRO* discussed in the context of *PRO* controlling federal spending , the line - item veto is characterized *-59 as a way 0 for <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> to excise perfectly constitutional provisions in a spending bill that *T*-2 are objectionable merely because they conflict with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> policy objectives *T*-1 .
The excision of unconstitutional conditions in an appropriations bill would be a power of far more limited applicability .
One could argue that it *EXP*-1 is not an assertion of a item veto at all for <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> , by *PRO*-2 exerting a power of excision , to resist unconstitutional conditions in legislation that *T*-3 violate <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the separation of powers</COREF> .
There is no downside if <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> asserts a right of excision over unconstitutional conditions in <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the fiscal 1990 appropriations bills</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> does nothing , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> will have won .
If <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> takes the dispute to <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> -LRB- *PRO*-2 assuming 0 <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can establish standing 0 *PRO* to sue *T*-1 -RRB- , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> might win .
In that case , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might receive an opinion *ICH*-2 from <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> that *T*-1 is a vindication of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the president 's</COREF> right *PRO* to perform the duties and exercise the prerogatives 0 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the framers</COREF> thought 0 *T*-3 should be entrusted *-60 to <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the executive</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> loses at <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the court</COREF> , it might be disappointing , as Morrison v. Olson was *?* for <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the presidency</COREF> would be no worse off than <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *?* now .
Moreover , the electorate would have received a valuable civics lesson in how <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the separation of powers</COREF> works in practice *T*-1 .
As it stands now , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> presumes after <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration</COREF> that the White House will take unconstitutional provisions in appropriations bills *PRO*-1 lying down .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> should set things *PRO*-1 straight .
If <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does not , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will help *PRO* realize <COREF ID="149" TYPE="IDENT">Madison 's</COREF> fear in The Federalist No. 48 of a legislature `` everywhere extending the sphere of its activity and drawing all powers into its impetuous vortex . ''
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Sidak</COREF> served as an attorney in <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> longer analysis of executive power and <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations clause</COREF> is *PRO*-1 to appear in the Duke Law Journal later this year .
