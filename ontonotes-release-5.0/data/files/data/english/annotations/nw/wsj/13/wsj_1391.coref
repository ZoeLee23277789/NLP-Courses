<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> could exhaust <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> foreign - exchange reserves</COREF> as early as <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF> , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">a Western government report</COREF> says 0 *?* , unless imports are cut *-1 drastically *PRO* to help narrow <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the balance - of - payments deficit</COREF> .
According to <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the report , completed * last month ,</COREF> if <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> trade gap continues *-1 to widen at the pace seen * in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the first seven months of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the reserves</COREF> would be wiped out *-2 either in <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">1990</COREF> or <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">1991</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">A country</COREF> is considered *-1 financially healthy if <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> reserves cover <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">three months of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> imports</COREF> .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The $ 14 billion *U* of reserves 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> had *T*-1 in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">June</COREF></COREF> would cover <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">just that much</COREF> .
The report by the Western government , which *T*-2 declines *PRO*-2 to be identified *-1 , concludes that `` a near - term foreign - exchange payment problem can be avoided *-3 only if import growth drops to below 5 % per annum . ''
According to Chinese customs figures , import growth has slowed in recent months , *PRO*-1 dropping to 16 % in July and 7.1 % in August from the year - earlier periods , compared with an average growth rate of 26 % in the first half .
But before import growth slowed , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> buying spree in the first half</COREF> already had taken <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> toll on foreign - exchange reserves .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The $ 14 billion *U* level in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">June</COREF></COREF> marked a drop from $ 19 billion *U* at the end of April .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> last big import binge sent reserves *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">tumbling</COREF> to $ 10.6 billion *U* in June 1985 from $ 16.6 billion *U* the previous September .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> might stave off a crisis if <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> acts as forcefully as <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did *PRO*-1 to arrest <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">1985</COREF> decline , when <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF> slammed the brakes on foreign - exchange spending and devalued the currency *T*-2</COREF> .
But this time , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> faces a more difficult battle because of economic forces that *T*-1 have come into play since the Tiananmen Square killings <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">June 4</COREF> .
For example , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> hard - currency income is expected *-1 to suffer from the big drop in tourist arrivals since <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">June 4</COREF> .
Revenue from tourism <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> is <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">projected</COREF> *-1 to total $ 1.3 billion *U* , down from $ 2.2 billion *U* <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> .
Because of <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and the huge trade gap , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the deficit in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> current account , which *T*-1 measures trade in goods and services plus certain unilateral transfers of funds ,</COREF> is expected *-2 to widen sharply from the $ 3.8 billion *U* deficit <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">The Western government report</COREF> suggests a number of scenarios for <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> current - account balance</COREF> , two of which *T*-2 are considered *-1 most likely .
In <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">one</COREF> , imports and exports continue *-1 to grow at the respective average rates of 25 % and 5 % recorded * during <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the first seven months</COREF> , and <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the current - account deficit</COREF> widens to $ 13.1 billion *U* .
In <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">1985</COREF> , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> had a record deficit of $ 11.4 billion *U* .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">The other scenario</COREF> assumes that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF> takes effective actions *PRO* to curb imports in the coming months .
In <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> would still finish <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF> with a current - account deficit of $ 8.7 billion *U* , based on projections that imports for all of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> grow 20 % and exports 10 % .
If <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> were still on good terms with foreign lenders , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> might be able *PRO*-1 to stem the drain on <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> foreign - exchange reserves</COREF> by *PRO*-2 using some loan funds *PRO*-3 to offset the current - account deficit .
But since <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">June</COREF> , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">foreign bankers led * by international financial institutions</COREF> have virtually suspended <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> new loans to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> .
Even if borrowing resumes , commercial bankers are n't expected *-1 to lend as much as before .
In addition , economists are forecasting a slowdown in foreign direct investments as businessmen become increasingly wary of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> deteriorating political and economic environment .
On top of all this , foreign - debt repayments are expected *-1 to peak in <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">1991</COREF> to 1992 .
With less capital coming in , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> balance of payments</COREF> would suffer .
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">The Western government report 's</COREF> first scenario</COREF> assumes a 30 % reduction in foreign borrowing and a 5 % contraction in foreign direct investment .
In <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the second</COREF> , foreign borrowing is projected *PRO*-1 to grow 10 % and investment *PRO*-2 to drop 10 % .
But in either case , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the report</COREF> says 0 *?* , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> balance of payments</COREF> would rapidly dry up <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">foreign reserves , which *T*-1 are used *-3 *PRO* to finance the imbalance</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the first scenario</COREF> , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the reserves</COREF> would be exhausted *-1 <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF> , and in <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the second</COREF> <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would be wiped out *-2 in <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">1991</COREF> .
