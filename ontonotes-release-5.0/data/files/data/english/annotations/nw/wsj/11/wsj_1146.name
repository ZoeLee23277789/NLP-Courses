The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> rat will eat well <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">Tons</ENAMEX> of delectably rotting potatoes , barley and wheat will fill damp barns across the land as <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of farmers turn the state 's buyers away .
Many a piglet wo n't be born as a result , and many a ham will never hang in a butcher shop .
But with inflation raging , grain in the barn will still be a safer bet for the private farmer than money in the bank .
Once again , the indomitable peasant holds <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> 's future in his hands .
Until his labor can produce a profit in this dying and distorted system , even <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> 's sympathetic new government wo n't win him over .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">coming months</ENAMEX> , emergency food aid moving in from the West will be the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> buffer between a meat - hungry public and a new political calamity .
Factory workers on strike knocked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> bosses off balance <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</ENAMEX> ; <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> , it was the farmers who brought them down .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">June</ENAMEX> , farmers held onto meat , milk and grain , waiting for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> 's usual state - directed price rises .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> froze prices instead .
The farmers ran a boycott , and meat disappeared from the shops .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 1</ENAMEX> , the state tore up its controls , and food prices leaped .
Without buffer stocks , inflation exploded .
That was when the tame old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peasants ' Party</ENAMEX> , desperate to live through the crisis , broke ranks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> and joined with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the East Bloc 's</ENAMEX> first liberated government .
But by the time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> took office in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> , the damage was done .
`` Shortageflation , '' as economists have come to call it , had gone hyper .
The cost of raising a pig kept bounding ahead of the return for selling one .
The farmers stayed angry .
They still are .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">dawn</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a cool day</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">hundreds</ENAMEX> travel to the private market in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Radzymin</ENAMEX> , a town not far from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> , hauling pigs , cattle and sacks of feed that the state 's official buyers ca n't induce them to sell .
Here , they are searching for a higher price .
In a crush of trucks and horse carts on the trodden field , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrzej Latowski</ENAMEX> wrestles a screeching , overweight hog into the trunk of a private butcher 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Fiat</ENAMEX> .
`` Of course it 's better to sell private , '' he says , as the butcher trundles away .
`` Why should anybody want to sell to them ? ''
The young farmer makes money on the few hogs he sells here .
He wo n't for long , because his old state sources of rye and potatoes are drying up .
`` There 's no feed , '' he says .
`` You ca n't buy anything nowadays .
I do n't know why . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward Chojnowski</ENAMEX> does .
His truck is parked across the field , in a row of grain sellers .
Like the others , it is loaded with rye , wheat and oats in sacks labeled `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Asbestos . Made in U.S.S.R</ENAMEX> . ''
The farmer at the next truck shouts , `` Wheat !
It 's nice !
It wo n't be cheaper !
We sell direct ! ''
A heavy , kerchiefed woman runs a handful through her fingers , and counts him out a pile of zlotys .
`` Country people breed pigs , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chojnowski</ENAMEX> , leaning against the back of his truck .
`` They ca n't buy feed from the state .
There is n't enough .
Some state middlemen come to buy from me .
I sell -- a little .
I am waiting .
I have plenty more at home . ''
On <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</ENAMEX> , he does n't sell much in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Radzymin</ENAMEX> , either .
At closing time , farmers cart out most of what they carted in .
A private market like this just is n't big enough to absorb all that business .
The hulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Stalinism</ENAMEX> , it seems , will not quickly crumble away .
State monopolies will keep on stifling trade , `` free '' prices or not , until something else replaces them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> agriculture will need a whole private network of procurement , processing and distribution -- plus a new manufacturing industry to supply it with tractors , pesticides , fertilizers and feed .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> spent <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years</ENAMEX> working to ensure that no such capitalistic structures ever arose here .
Building them now will require undergirding from the West , and removal of political deadwood , a job that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> has barely started .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> agriculture does possess <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> great asset already : the private farmer .
`` We are dealing with real entrepreneurs , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Antoni Leopold</ENAMEX> , an economist who advises <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rural Solidarity</ENAMEX> , the union 's countryside offshoot .
`` There are a lot of them , and they have property . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> peasants , spurning the collectivizers , were once a source of shame to orthodox <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> .
Now , among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> reformers , they are objects of envy .
Food is the reformer 's top priority , the key to popular support .
As the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Chinese</ENAMEX> have shown and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviets</ENAMEX> are learning , family farms thrive where collectives fail .
Ownership , it seems , is the best fertilizer .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Poles</ENAMEX> have had it all along .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2.7 million</ENAMEX> small private farms cover <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">76 %</ENAMEX> of its arable land .
On it , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">a quarter</ENAMEX> of the country 's <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">39 million</ENAMEX> people produce <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three - quarters</ENAMEX> of its grain , beef , eggs and milk , and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine - tenths</ENAMEX> of its fruit , vegetables and potatoes .
Like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Roman Catholic Church</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> peasant is a pillar of the nation .
Try as they might , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> could neither replace nor break him .
And they did try .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">A few miles</ENAMEX> past <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Radzymin</ENAMEX> , a dirt road narrows to a track of sand and leads into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zalubice</ENAMEX> , a village of tumbledown farms .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Czeslaw Pyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> owns <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">30 acres</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">14</ENAMEX> scattered scraps .
He grows rye and potatoes for a few hens , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> cows and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">25</ENAMEX> piglets .
In patched pants and torn shoes , he stands in his barnyard eyeing the ground with a look both helpless and sardonic .
`` It 's bad soil , '' he says .
Until <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</ENAMEX> , it was good soil .
Then the state put in a reservoir to supply the area with drinking water .
Farmers lay down before the bulldozers .
Their protest was ignored .
The dam caused the water level to drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zalubice</ENAMEX> .
Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> smiles and his brow furrows .
He expected as much .
In his <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">lifetime</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">47 years</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> brought electricity to his village and piped in drinking water from the reservoir .
No phones .
No gas .
`` We wanted them to build a road here , '' he says .
`` They started , and then abandoned it . ''
A tractor , his only mechanized equipment , stands in front of the pigsty .
`` It 's <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> .
Good for nothing .
Parts are a tragedy .
Even if I had a lot of money , I could n't buy what I need . ''
The farmer can say the same for coal , cement , saw blades .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> , only <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">4 %</ENAMEX> of all investment goes toward making things farmers want ; in the West , it is closer to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">20 %</ENAMEX> .
The few big state farms take first crack at what does get made .
They use <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">60 %</ENAMEX> more fertilizer per acre , twice the high - grade feed .
Yet their best boast is that they produce <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">32 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> pork .
`` I 've heard from friends that state farms are subsidized , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> says as his wife , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wieslawa</ENAMEX> , sets some chairs out in the sun .
`` We have one near here .
There is a lot of waste .
A private farmer never wastes anything . ''
The state quit shoving peasants onto its subsidized farms <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">over 30 years ago</ENAMEX> .
But it never did let up on the pressure .
Until recently , a farmer with no heir had to will the state his land to collect his pension .
The pension 's size still depends on how much produce he sells the state .
His allotment of materials also did , until the state could n't hold up its end of that bargain .
Yet the state alone sells seeds and machines .
When supplies are short , it often hands them over only in exchange for milk or grain .
A private farmer in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> is free to buy and sell land , hire help , decide what to grow and how to grow it .
He is free to invest in chickens , and to fail for lack of chicken wire .
He has plenty of freedom -- but no choices .
`` I 'm on my own land , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pyszkiewicz</ENAMEX> says .
`` I do n't have to listen to what anybody tells me to do . ''
`` Sometimes , '' says his wife , `` we 're happy about that . ''
By starving the peasant , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> have starved <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> .
Villages like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Zalubice</ENAMEX> exist in a desert of poor schools and few doctors .
Farm income is <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">15 %</ENAMEX> below the average .
The young leave , especially girls who wo n't milk cows by hand .
Some men stay , their best friend a bottle of vodka , but <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two million acres</ENAMEX> have gone fallow .
Without machines , good farms ca n't get bigger .
So the potato crop , once <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">47 million tons</ENAMEX> , is down to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">35 million</ENAMEX> .
Meat consumption is at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</ENAMEX> 's level , pork production at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</ENAMEX> 's , milk output at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1960</ENAMEX> 's .
If a food crisis undid the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> , a food revolution will make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> .
The potential is displayed along every road into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> : row upon row of greenhouses , stretching out behind modern mansions that trumpet their owners ' wealth .
Vegetables are abundant and full of flavor in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> , the pickles and sauerkraut sublime , the state monopolies long broken .
Grain , milk and meat come next .
A private challenge to the monolithic tractor industry will take more time and money than <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> can spare , although a smokehouse or a local dairy can spring up fast .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> makes no machinery for a plant on that scale .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> wants it from the West .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maria Stolzman</ENAMEX> , one of its farm experts , lays it on the line : `` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The World Bank</ENAMEX> will be brought in to help us destroy the old system . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Felix Siemienas</ENAMEX> is destroying it now .
He packs pork .
A law went on the books in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">January</ENAMEX> that let him smoke bacon without breeding pigs .
He cashed in .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> is short on enterprises , not enterprise .
`` I pay a lot to the farmer and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> times the state salary to my employees , '' he says .
He is in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Warsaw</ENAMEX> to open a shop .
`` I hire transportation , and my customers have fresh cold cuts <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">every day</ENAMEX> .
I do n't subsidize anyone .
Everyone around me lives well .
Yes , my prices are high .
If nobody buys , I bring my prices down .
That 's the rule .
That 's the market . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Siemienas</ENAMEX> is making a fortune -- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">10,000</ENAMEX> a month , he says .
He has bought some trendy Western clothes , and a green <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Mercedes</ENAMEX> with an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> flag in the window .
But the meat - processing machines he picked up are <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years old</ENAMEX> .
`` I do n't want expensive machines .
If the situation changes , I 'll get stuck with them . ''
That 's politics .
By taking power in a deal with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Peasant Party 's</ENAMEX> onetime <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> stooges , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> has spooked the rural entrepreneur .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rural Solidarity</ENAMEX> objected , to no avail , when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> leader <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lech Walesa</ENAMEX> accepted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peasants</ENAMEX> ' support .
It objected again in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> when Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tadeusz Mazowiecki</ENAMEX> reluctantly named a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peasant Party</ENAMEX> man as his agriculture minister .
Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peasants</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rural Solidarity</ENAMEX> are forming new political parties for farmers .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Peasants</ENAMEX> can make a credible case , against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> , that hell - bent reform will drive <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">millions</ENAMEX> from the land .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Next Spring</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> will battle in local elections .
But until then , and probably long afterward , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communists</ENAMEX> ' apparat of obstruction -- from the head of the dairy co-op to the village bank manager -- will stay planted in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Polish</ENAMEX> countryside .
`` We know how to get from capitalism to socialism , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sergiusz Niciporuk</ENAMEX> is saying <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">one afternoon</ENAMEX> .
`` We do n't know how to get from socialism to capitalism . ''
He farms <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">12 acres</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Grabowiec</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two miles</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Soviet</ENAMEX> border in one of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> 's poorest places .
Now he is mounting the steps of a stucco building in a nearby village , on a visit to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Communist</ENAMEX> administrator , the `` naczelnik . ''
`` Many people in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> hope this government will break down , '' says Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niciporuk</ENAMEX> , who belongs to the local council and to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Rural Solidarity</ENAMEX> .
`` That 's what the naczelnik counts on .
He is our most dangerous enemy .
Every time he sees me , he gets very nervous . ''
The farmer barges into the naczelnik 's office .
A thin man in a gray suit looks up from a newspaper .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niciporuk</ENAMEX> sits .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anatol Pawlowski 's</ENAMEX> leg begins jiggling beneath his desk .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> does n't care for the good of this region , '' he says after a few pleasantries .
`` They want to turn everything upside down in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a week</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Niciporuk</ENAMEX> here wants <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">60 acres</ENAMEX> used at the moment by a state farm .
He ca n't guarantee that he can use it any better . ''
`` I am ready at any moment to compete with a state farm . ''
The naczelnik averts his eyes .
`` What have you got ?
Not even a tractor .
And you want to make wicker baskets , too . ''
`` I can do <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> things at once -- to be a businessman . ''
`` Big business , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pawlowski</ENAMEX> snorts in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> .
The farmer stands to go .
The naczelnik stands , too .
`` I care very much for this post , '' he says .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Eight years</ENAMEX> I 've had it .
A cultural center has been built , shops .
Suddenly , I am not a comfortable man for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Solidarity</ENAMEX> .
I have accomplished too much .
They want to do more .
I wish them all the best ! ''
The farmer leaves .
And the naczelnik shuts his door .
