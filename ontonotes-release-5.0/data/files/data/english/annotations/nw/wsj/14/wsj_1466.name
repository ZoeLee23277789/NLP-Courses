<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Better Business Bureau of San Diego</ENAMEX> and the state Attorney General 's office entered into a settlement stemming from an investigation of bureau - sponsored business directories published by an outside firm , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Better Book Inc</ENAMEX> .
The settlement stems from charges that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Better Book</ENAMEX> , now defunct , made misrepresentations in selling advertising for the directories and memberships in the bureau <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1984 to 1986</ENAMEX> .
Without admitting any guilt , the bureau agreed to several conditions if it again contracts with an outside firm to publish its directories .
The conditions include not misrepresenting how many directories will be distributed , and agreeing to make refunds to directory advertisers if any misrepresentations are involved in the sale .
The Attorney General 's investigation was sparked by lawsuits and charges by angry <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> businesspeople that they were swindled in a bureau - sponsored directory project contracted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Better Book</ENAMEX> .
The uproar led to the closing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Los Angeles Better Business Bureau</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1987</ENAMEX> .
