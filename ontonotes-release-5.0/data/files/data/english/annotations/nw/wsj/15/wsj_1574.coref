<COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">FOX HUNTING</COREF> HAS been defined *-1 as the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible , but at least <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's exercise .
At least <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has a little dash .
Most of <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> have *-2 to spend <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> time on <COREF ID="237" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">pursuits</COREF> that *T*-1 afford neither , <COREF ID="237" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">drab duties rather than pleasures</COREF> .
Like <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">*PRO* <COREF ID="190" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">trying *PRO*-1 to buy life insurance</COREF> , for instance , <COREF ID="190" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an endeavor notably lacking in dash</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* Call <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 the uninformed trudging after the incomprehensible .
But sooner or later , most of <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> have *-1 to think about life insurance , just as <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> often have *-2 to think about *PRO*-3 having root - canal work .
And <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> time has come .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm 33 , married , no children , and employed *-1 in *PRO*-2 writing stories like this one .
In times past , life - insurance salesmen targeted heads of household , meaning men , but ours is a two - income family and accustomed *-1 to it .
So if anything happened to <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd want *PRO*-1 to leave behind enough so that <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> 33 - year - old husband would be able *PRO*-2 to pay off the mortgage and some other debts -LRB- though not , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> admit *?* , enough *PRO* to put any potential second wife in the lap of luxury -RRB- .
*PRO*-2 Figuring that maybe $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 *U* would do but having no idea of what kind of policy <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wanted *T*-1 , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> looked at the myriad products of a dozen companies -- and plunged into a jungle of gibberish .
Over the past decade or two , while <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was thinking about fox hunting , <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">the insurance industry</COREF> has spawned an incredible number of products , <COREF ID="238" TYPE="IDENT">variations on products</COREF> , and variations on <COREF ID="238" TYPE="IDENT">the variations</COREF> .
Besides <COREF ID="239" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">term life and whole life</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="239" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the old standbys</COREF> -RRB- , <COREF ID="188" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> now have universal life , universal variable life , flexible adjustable universal life , policies with persistency bonuses , policies festooned * with exotic riders , living benefit policies , and on and on .
What *PRO* to do *T*-1 ?
First , *PRO* generalize .
*PRO*-1 Shorn *-6 of all <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> riders , special provisions , and other bells and whistles , <COREF ID="185" TYPE="IDENT">insurance policies</COREF> can still be grouped *-1 under <COREF ID="193" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">two broad categories</COREF> : <COREF ID="193" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">so - called pure insurance , which *T*-3 amasses no cash value in the policy and pays off only upon death</COREF> , and permanent insurance , which *T*-4 provides not only a death benefit but also a cash value in the policy that *T*-5 can be used *-2 in various ways while the insured is still alive</COREF> .
If all 0 you want *T*-1 is death - benefit coverage , <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">pure insurance</COREF> -- <COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a term policy</COREF> --</COREF> gives you maximum bang for your buck , within limits .
<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's much cheaper than permanent insurance bought * at the same age .
But `` term '' means just that ; <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">the policy</COREF> is written *-2 for a specific time period only and must be renewed *-2 when <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> expires *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> may also stipulate that <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the insured</COREF> must pass another medical exam before renewal ; if <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> flunk -- which *T*-1 means 0 <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> need insurance more than ever -- <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> may not be able *PRO*-2 to buy <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Even if <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're healthy and can renew , <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> premium will go up sharply because <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're that much older .
So <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">term insurance</COREF> may not be as cheap as <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> looks *?* .
There are <COREF ID="197" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">all sorts of variations on term insurance</COREF> : <COREF ID="197" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">policies structured * *PRO*-1 to pay off your mortgage debt , term riders tacked on to permanent insurance , and many others</COREF> .
One variation that *T*-1 appealed to <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> at first was <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">the `` Money Smart Term Life '' policy offered * by <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="187" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Amex Life Insurance Co.</COREF> , <COREF ID="187" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">American Express</COREF> unit</COREF></COREF> , to <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">the parent company 's</COREF> credit - card holders</COREF> .
Upon examination , however , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wondered whether <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> made a lot of sense .
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">Amex</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would charge <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> $ 576 *U* a year for $ 100,000 *U* of coverage -- and would pay <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> back <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">all the premiums 0 <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> put *T*-1 in</COREF> if <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> canceled the policy after 10 years .
*PRO* Sounds great -- or does <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *?* ?
First , if <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> canceled , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd have <COREF ID="200" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">no more insurance</COREF> , <COREF ID="200" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a not insignificant consideration</COREF> .
Second , <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">the $ 5,760 *U* 0 <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd get *T*-3 back</COREF> would be much diminished *-1 in purchasing power by 10 years of inflation ; <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">Amex , not <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ,</COREF> would get the benefit of <COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the investment income</COREF> on <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> money</COREF> , <COREF ID="202" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">income that *T*-2 would have exceeded the inflation rate and thus given <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> a real profit</COREF> .
Third and most important , <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">Amex</COREF> would charge <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> a far higher premium than other reputable companies would *?* on a straight term policy for the same amount ; <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd be paying so heavily *ICH*-2 *PRO*-1 just to have the option of *PRO* getting <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> premiums</COREF> back that <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd almost have *-3 to <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">cancel</COREF> *PRO*-3 to make the whole thing worthwhile .
<COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> would be all right with <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">Amex , which *T*-1 could then lock in its investment profit</COREF> , but <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't add up to a `` smart money '' move for <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
Which *T*-1 goes *PRO*-2 to show that the First Law applies in insurance as in anything else : There is no free lunch , there is only marketing .
And <COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">the Second Law , unique to insurance</COREF> ?
If <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> die early , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">win</COREF> -- <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">a hollow victory , since <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't enjoy it</COREF> -- and if <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> live long , the insurer wins .
Always .
<COREF ID="204" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is worth remembering when insurers and their salesmen try *PRO*-2 to sell you permanent insurance , the kind that *T*-1 amasses cash value *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">The word `` death ''</COREF> can not be escaped *-1 entirely by <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> , but salesmen dodge <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> wherever possible *T*-4 or cloak <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in euphemisms , *PRO*-2 preferring *PRO*-3 to talk about `` savings '' and `` investment '' instead .
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">The implication</COREF> is that your permanent - insurance policy is really some kind of CD or mutual - fund account with an added feature .
<COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is *PRO* gilding the lily .
The fact is that as a savings or investment vehicle , insurance generally <COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">runs</COREF> a poor second to any direct investment 0 you might make *T*-1 in the same things 0 <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the insurance company</COREF> is putting your money into *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="208" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's because you have *-1 to <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">pay</COREF> for the insurance portion of <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the policy</COREF> and the effort required * *PRO* to sell and service the whole package .
Again , no free lunch .
<COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is reflected *-1 in a built - in mortality cost -- in effect , your share of <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> estimated liability in *PRO* paying off beneficiaries of people who *T*-2 had the effrontery *PRO* to die while *PRO* under <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> protection .
And in most cases , a huge hunk of your premium in the initial year or two of <COREF ID="210" TYPE="IDENT">the the policy</COREF> is , in effect , <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">paying</COREF> the salesman 's commission as well ; investment returns on most policies are actually negative for several years , largely because of <COREF ID="211" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> .
So *PRO* view <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">permanent insurance</COREF> for what <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-1 -- a compromise between pure insurance and direct investment .
The simplest , most traditional form of permanent insurance is the straight whole life policy .
You pay <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">a set premium</COREF> for a set amount of coverage , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> invests <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">that premium</COREF> in a portfolio of <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> choosing , and your cash value and dividends grow over the years .
One newer wrinkle , so called single - premium life -LRB- <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> pay for the whole policy at once -RRB- , has been immensely popular in recent years for tax reasons ; <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">the insured</COREF> could extract cash value in the form of policy `` loans , '' and none of <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">the proceeds</COREF> <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">were</COREF> taxable even though <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> included gains on investment .
<COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> closed <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">this loophole</COREF> last year , or thought 0 <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did *?* .
However , <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">Monarch Capital Corp. of Springfield , Mass. ,</COREF> has developed a `` combination plan '' of annuity and insurance coverage that <COREF ID="215" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> says 0 *T*-1 does not violate the new regulations and that *T*-1 allows policy loans without tax consequences .
But the percentage of your cash reserve that you can borrow *T*-1 tax - free is very small .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not prepared in any case *PRO*-1 to put that much money into a policy immediately , so <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> look into the broad category called * *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">universal life</COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Hugely popular , <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is far more flexible than straight whole life .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can adjust <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the amount of insurance 0 <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *T*-1</COREF> against <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">the amount going into investment</COREF> ; <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can pay more or less than the so - called target premium in a given year ; and <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can even skip payments if <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> cash reserves are enough *PRO* to cover the insurance portion of the policy .
In *PRO*-2 looking at these and other policies , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> learn *PRO*-2 to ask pointed questions about some of the assumptions built * into <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">`` <COREF ID="218" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">policy illustrations</COREF> '' -- <COREF ID="218" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the rows of numbers that *T*-1 show <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> the buildup of <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> cash values over the years</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> commonly give two scenarios : One is based *-1 on interest rates that <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> guarantees *T*-2 -LRB- usually 4 % to 4.5 % *U* -RRB- and <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">the other</COREF> on the rate 0 <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is currently getting *T*-3 on investment , often 8.5 % or more .
*PRO*-1 Projecting <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">the latter</COREF> over <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">several decades</COREF> , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> find 0 <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> cash buildup is impressive -- but can any high interest rate prevail for <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT">that long</COREF> ?
Not likely , <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 *PRO* *T*-1 .
Also , some policy illustrations assume that mortality costs will decline or that <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will get some sort of dividend bonus after the 10th year .
These are not certain , either .
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">Companies</COREF> `` are n't comfortable *PRO*-1 playing these games , but <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> realize 0 <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're under pressure *PRO* to make <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> policies look good , '' says 0 *T*-2 <COREF ID="220" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Timothy Pfiefer</COREF> , <COREF ID="220" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an actuarial consultant at <COREF ID="221" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tillinghast</COREF> , <COREF ID="221" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a unit of <COREF ID="222" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Towers Perrin Co.</COREF> , <COREF ID="222" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the big <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> consulting firm</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
Another factor 0 *PRO* to consider *T*-1 : Some of the companies currently <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">earning</COREF> very high yields are <COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT">doing</COREF> so through substantial investment in junk bonds , and you know how nervous the market has been *T*-2 about those lately .
There are <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">seemingly endless twists to universal life</COREF> , and it *EXP*-1 pays *PRO* to ask questions about all of <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
At a back - yard barbecue , for example , <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">a friend</COREF> boasts that <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 'll only have *-1 to pay premiums on <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> John Hancock policy for seven years and that <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> death benefits will then be `` guaranteed *-2 . ''
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> call <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="225" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> agent</COREF> , <COREF ID="225" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">David Dominici</COREF></COREF> .
Yes , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , premiums on such variable - rate coverage can be structured *-2 *PRO*-3 to `` vanish '' after a certain period -- but usually only if interest rates stay high enough *PRO* to generate sufficient cash 0 *T*-1 to cover the annual cost of insurance protection .
If interest rates plunge , the insurer may be <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">knocking</COREF> on <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> door , *PRO*-1 asking for steeper premium payments 0 *T*-2 to maintain the same amount of protection .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't like the sound of <COREF ID="226" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
<COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">Some insurers</COREF> have also started *-2 offering <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">`` persistency bonuses , '' such as extra dividends or a marginally higher interest yield</COREF> , if the policy is maintained *-1 for 10 years .
But <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="227" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Glenn Daily</COREF> , <COREF ID="227" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT">New York - based</COREF> financial consultant</COREF> ,</COREF> warns that many of <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">these bonuses</COREF> are `` just fantasies , '' because most are n't guaranteed *-1 by <COREF ID="229" TYPE="IDENT">the companies</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="228" TYPE="IDENT">the feature</COREF> is so new , <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> adds 0 *?* , that no insurer has yet established a track record for *PRO* actually making such payments .
<COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">So - called living - benefits provisions</COREF> also merit a close inspection .
*PRO*-3 Offered *-2 by insurers that *T*-1 include Security - Connecticut Life Insurance Co. , Jackson National Life Insurance Co. , and National Travelers Life Insurance Co. , <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">these policy riders</COREF> let <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> tap a portion of <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> death benefits while <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm still alive .
Some provisions would let <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> collect a percentage of the policy 's face value *PRO*-1 to pay for long - term care such as nursing - home stays ; others would allow payments for catastrophic illnesses and conditions such as cancer , heart attarcks , renal failure and kidney transplants .
But the catastrophic events for which the policyholder can collect *T*-1 are narrowly defined , vary from policy to policy , and generally permit use of only a small fraction of the face amount of insurance .
Also , <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">financial planners advising on insurance</COREF> say that to <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> knowledge there has not yet been a tax ruling exempting these advance payments from taxes .
And considering the extra cost of such provisions , some figure that people interested in , say , *PRO* paying for <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">extended nursing - home care</COREF> would be better off *PRO*-2 just buying a separate policy that *T*-1 provides <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm more favorably impressed *-1 by `` <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">no - load life</COREF> , '' even though <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> turns out *-2 to be low - load life .
Insureres selling <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">these policies</COREF> market <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> directly to the public or otherwise do n't use commissioned salesmen ; there is still a load -- annual administrative fees and initial `` setup '' charges -- but <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> figure that the lack of commission and of `` surrender fees '' for *PRO* dropping the policy early still saves <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> a lot .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> compared <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">one universal policy for $ 130,000 *U* face amount from <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="231" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">such an insurer</COREF> , <COREF ID="231" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">American Life Insurance Corp. of Lincoln , Neb. ,</COREF></COREF></COREF> with <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">a similar offering from <COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S.</COREF> , which *T*-1 operates through 11,000 commissioned salesmen</COREF> .
After one year <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could walk away from the <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">Ameritas</COREF> policy with $ 792 *U* , but <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Id</COREF> get only $ 14 *U* from <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">the Equitable</COREF> .
The difference is magnified *-1 by time , too .
At age 65 , when <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd stop *-2 paying premiums *T*-1 , <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">Ameritas</COREF> offering</COREF> would have a projected cash value $ 14,000 *U* higher than <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">the other</COREF> , even though <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="233" TYPE="IDENT">the Equitable 's</COREF> policy illustration</COREF> assumed a fractionally higher interest rate .
Did <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> buy <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ?
Well , not yet .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm thinking about *PRO*-1 using the $ 871 *U* annual premium *PRO*-2 to finance a trip to <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">Paris</COREF> first .
<COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">A person</COREF> can do <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">some heavy thinking about insurance</COREF> <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">there</COREF> -- and shop for something more exciting while <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 's doing <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
