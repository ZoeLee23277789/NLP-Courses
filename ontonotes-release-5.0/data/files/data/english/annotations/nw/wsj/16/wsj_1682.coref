WASHINGTON LIES LOW after <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market 's</COREF> roller - coaster ride</COREF> .
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">Lawmakers</COREF> , *PRO*-1 haunted * by charges that some of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> comments contributed to <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">1987</COREF> crash</COREF> , generally shy away from calls for sweeping new legislation .
But a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee will quiz <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">SEC</COREF> Chairman Breeden</COREF> Wednesday , and <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> Secretary Brady</COREF> will go before the Senate Banking panel Thursday .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">The market 's</COREF> wild week</COREF> may speed along the market - reform legislation that *T*-1 has been pending for months in the aftermath of <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">1987</COREF> crash</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> may also expedite <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC 's</COREF> modest pending changes in junk - bond disclosure rules and intensify <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury 's</COREF> look at plans for *PRO* giving new tax breaks on dividends and raising taxes on short - term trades by pension funds .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Brady</COREF> and <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Breeden</COREF> work well together on <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the plunge</COREF> , despite the fact that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> secretary</COREF> opposed <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Breeden 's</COREF> nomination to the <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">SEC</COREF> post .
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">BAKER</COREF> FALTERS in the Mideast amid Israeli paralysis and Palestinian politics .
Despite *PRO*-1 seeing <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> plan for Israeli - Palestinian elections</COREF> wither , <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the cautious secretary of state</COREF> is so far unwilling *PRO*-1 to cut U.S. economic or military aid *PRO*-2 to force Israeli cooperation .
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> nonetheless remains furious both at <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Shamir</COREF> , for *PRO*-1 backing down on the elections , and at <COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Shamir 's</COREF> rival</COREF> , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Peres</COREF> , for political ineptitude in *PRO*-2 forcing a premature cabinet vote on <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Baker 's</COREF> plan</COREF> .
Meanwhile , some U.S. officials fear 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">PLO chief Arafat</COREF> is getting cold feet and may back off from <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> recent moderation and renunciation of terrorism .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is under intense fire from other Palestinian groups ; Syria is pushing Ahmad Jibril , whose terrorist band *T*-2 is blamed *-1 for the Pan Am 103 bombing , as an alternative to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Arafat</COREF> .
DARMAN'S MANEUVERS on the budget and capital gains hurt <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in Congress .
Republicans as well as Democrats were angered *-1 by <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the budget director 's</COREF> rejection of Speaker Foley 's effort *PRO* to expedite <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">a deficitcutting measure</COREF> by *PRO*-2 stripping <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> of the capital - gains tax cut as well as pet Democratic projects .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Darman</COREF> now blames the clash on miscommunication , but <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">House <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">GOP</COREF> leader Michel , who *T*-2 carried the offer to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> ,</COREF> observes , `` <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was speaking English *NOT* *NOT* at the time , and quite loud so <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could be understood *-1 . ''
Senate <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">GOP</COREF> leader Dole ridicules <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the budget chief</COREF> on the Senate floor .
<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">Democratic counterpart Mitchell</COREF> , *PRO*-4 asked *-2 *PRO*-3 to interpret <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Darman 's</COREF> threat *PRO* to make permanent <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the across - the - board Gramm - Rudman cuts that *T*-1 took effect this week</COREF> , says , `` <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't even bother *PRO*-5 to interpret <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> . ''
But <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Darman</COREF> suggests 0 such tensions will dissipate quickly .
`` If <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can show signs of maturity , almost anybody can *?* , '' <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> jokes *T*-1 .
HHS OFFICIALS expect <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Secretary Sullivan</COREF> to continue a ban on research using fetal tissue .
Before <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was confirmed *-1 , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Sullivan</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had `` reservations about any blanket prohibitions on medical research . ''
But now , an official says 0 *?* , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is `` surrounded *-1 by right - to - lifers , '' who *T*-2 contend that any breakthroughs in fetal - tissue research could increase the demand for abortions .
COOPERATION *ICH*-1 WANES on weapons development between <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and Europe .
Britain , France and Italy pull out of a proposal *PRO* to build new NATO frigates ; <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and West Germany have each withdrawn from missile projects .
Defense experts say 0 joint projects are increasingly squeezed *-1 by budget pressures and the desire *PRO* to save domestic jobs ; some also fear rising protectionism as European unity nears .
BOTH SIDES NOW :
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">GOP</COREF> lieutenant governor candidate Eddy Dalton</COREF> tries *PRO*-1 to have it both ways on <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the abortion issue</COREF> .
Though <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> opposes abortion in almost all cases , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> airs a TV commercial using pro-choice buzzwords .
`` <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">A woman</COREF> ought *-1 to have a choice in cases where <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> life or health are in danger *T*-2 and in cases of rape or incest , '' <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> proclaims *T*-3 .
HOT TOPIC :
Interest in <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the abortion issue</COREF> is so great that <COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Hotline</COREF> , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a daily , computer - distributed political newsletter</COREF> , comes up with a spinoff product called * *PRO*-1 the Abortion Report dealing solely with <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> political implications .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">CONSERVATIVES</COREF> EXPECT <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> to solidify <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> majority on <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">a key court</COREF> .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> has three vacancies 0 *PRO* to fill *T*-3 on <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the prestigious D.C. Circuit Court , which *T*-2 handles many important regulatory issues and is often considered *-1 a warm - up for future Supreme Court nominees</COREF> .
Conservatives now hold only a 5 - 4 edge .
One slot is expected *-1 to go to <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">EEOC Chairman Clarence Thomas</COREF> , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a black conservative</COREF></COREF> ; after *PRO*-2 mulling a fight , liberals now probably wo n't put up a major struggle against <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
Other conservatives thought * to be on <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> short list include Washington lawyer Michael Uhlmann , who *T*-1 was passed over for the No. 2 job at the Justice Department , and <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Marshall Breger</COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chairman of a U.S. agency on administration</COREF> .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> would also like *PRO*-1 to nominate a woman ; one possibility is former Justice Department official Victoria Toensing .
MINOR MEMOS :
In the wake of the failed Panama coup , a bumper sticker appears : `` Ollie Would Have Got Him . '' ...
Rep. Garcia , on trial for bribery and extortion , puts statements *ICH*-1 in the Congressional Record attributing missed votes to `` scheduling conflicts . '' ...
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">A <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">GOP</COREF> Senate fund - raising letter</COREF> from <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Burns of Montana</COREF></COREF> is made *-1 to appear *-2 personally written , and <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> opening line is , `` Please *PRO* excuse my handwriting . ''
But <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Burns</COREF> confesses in an interview : `` That 's not <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> handwriting .
