<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">`` The Famous Teddy Z , '' which <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">CBS Inc.</COREF> had hoped 0 *T*-2 would emerge as one of the few bright spots in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> otherwise lackluster prime - time schedule</COREF> , is n't turning out *-3 to be the hit 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> envisaged *T*-1 .
Although <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the half - hour situation comedy</COREF> seen * Mondays at 9:30 p.m . Eastern and Pacific time</COREF> is n't a candidate for cancellation , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is slated *-1 for fine - tuning and by next week <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> may announce 0 `` <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Teddy Z</COREF> '' is moving to 8:30 p.m. from <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> 9:30 time slot</COREF> , *PRO*-4 replacing `` The People Next Door , '' which *T*-3 became the first network show 0 *T*-5 to be canceled *-2 this season .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">`` Teddy Z , '' which *T*-2 centers on <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">a mailroom clerk - turned * *PRO*-5 agent at <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">a Hollywood talent agency</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> was scheduled *-1 in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the coveted 9:30 p.m. slot</COREF> *-3 *PRO*-4 to follow <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">`` <COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Murphy Brown</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="39" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a situation comedy about a television news magazine , starring Candice Bergen</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Teddy Z</COREF> '' was boosted *-1 by favorable reviews and a network - wide promotional tie - in contest with K mart Corp .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was promoted *-1 on cable services , including MTV , Nick at Night and VH - 1 , and <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">premiered</COREF> as the No. 22 - rated show for the week .
But five weeks after <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the premiere</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the series</COREF> has floundered .
In figures released * yesterday by A.C. Nielsen Co . `` <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Teddy Z</COREF> , '' *PRO*-1 produced * by the television unit of Columbia Pictures Entertainment Inc. , was in 37th place .
Worse , every week <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> suffers audience drop - off from `` <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Murphy Brown</COREF> '' and viewership on <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">CBS</COREF> picks up again once `` <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Teddy Z</COREF> '' is over and is followed *T*-1 by `` <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Designing Women</COREF> . ''
`` There is strong indication that ` <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Teddy Z</COREF> ' is not compatible with the shows 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is surrounding *T*-1 , '' said *T*-2 <COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Sisk</COREF> , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">senior vice president at <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">J. Walter Thompson Co.</COREF> , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a unit of WPP Group PLC</COREF></COREF> .
Last week , `` <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Murphy Brown</COREF> '' was viewed *-1 by 14.1 % of the available television households , while the number dropped to 12.6 % for `` <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Teddy Z</COREF> '' and rose to 14.2 % for `` <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Designing Women</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">CBS</COREF> executives said 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> is also slated *-1 *PRO*-2 to undergo some plot changes .
Creator Hugh Wilson , for example , included <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the lead character 's</COREF> Greek family</COREF> in the cast , `` but <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is not the right focus anymore , '' said 0 *T*-1 one <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">CBS</COREF> executive .
Instead , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">CBS</COREF> hopes 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the show</COREF> will increasingly highlight <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the talent agency</COREF> and the business of *PRO* being an agent .
`` <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're making adjustments *ICH*-2 on <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the show</COREF> , yes , but nothing radical , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Craig Nelson</COREF> , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the story consultant on `` <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Teddy Z</COREF></COREF></COREF> . ''
`` But <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> hope *PRO*-1 to keep a balance between the office and the family . ''
The opening credits are being redone *-2 , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Nelson</COREF> said 0 *?* , `` *PRO* to make <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Teddy 's</COREF> situation clear to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">viewers who *T*-1 have not been with <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> since <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the beginning</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Those viewers</COREF> find <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the show</COREF> confusing .
