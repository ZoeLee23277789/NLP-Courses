*PRO*-1 Sitting at the bar of the Four Seasons restaurant , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">architect William McDonough</COREF> seems *-1 oblivious to the glamorous clientele and the elegant setting .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is ogling the curtains rippling above the ventilation ducts .
`` *PRO* Look how much air *T*-1 is moving around ! '' <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *?* .
`` The ventilation here is great ! ''
You may be hearing more about <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the 38 - year - old Mr. McDonough</COREF> and <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> preoccupation with clean air .
After years of relative obscurity , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is starting *-1 to attract notice for the ecological *RNR*-2 as well as the aesthetic *RNR*-2 quality of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> architecture .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough</COREF> believes that the well - being of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the planet</COREF> depends on such stratagems as *PRO* opening windows *PRO* to cut indoor air pollution , tacking down carpets instead of *PRO* using toxic glues , and avoiding mahogany , which *T*-1 comes from endangered rain forests .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has put some of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> aesthetic ideas into practice with <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> design of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the four - star Quilted Giraffe restaurant</COREF> -- `` architecturally impeccable , '' Progressive Architecture magazine called it *PRO*-2 *T*-1 -- and <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> remodeling of <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Paul Stuart</COREF> , <COREF ID="25" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Madison Avenue clothing store</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has designed furniture and homes as well as commercial and office space .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is now designing a Broadway stage set for a show by the band Kid Creole and the Coconuts .
What *T*-1 really stirs <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> muse , though , is <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">aerobic architecture</COREF> .
Now the question is : Is <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> ready for <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough</COREF> is about *-1 to tackle <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> biggest clean - air challenge yet</COREF> , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the proposed Warsaw Trade Center in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the first such center in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Eastern Europe</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">The project</COREF> has already acquired a certain <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> cachet .
Bloomingdale 's plans *PRO*-1 to sell a foot - tall chocolate model of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the center</COREF> during the holidays .
Some of the sales proceeds will go to the Design Industries Foundation for AIDS .
A cake topped * with a replica of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the center</COREF> will be auctioned *-1 at an AIDS benefit at Sotheby 's in December .
If <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough 's</COREF> plans get executed *-2 , as much of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the Polish center</COREF> as possible will be made *-1 from aluminum , steel and glass recycled * from <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Warsaw 's</COREF> abundant rubble .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">A 20 - story mesh spire</COREF> will stand atop 50 stories of commercial space .
Solar - powered batteries will make <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the spire</COREF> glow .
The windows will open .
The carpets wo n't be glued down , and walls will be coated *-1 with nontoxic finishes .
To the extent that the $ 150 million *U* budget will allow <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough</COREF> will <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">rely</COREF> on solid wood , rather than plywood or particle board , *PRO*-2 to limit the emission of formaldehyde .
If <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough</COREF> has <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> way , the Poles will compensate for <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the trade center 's</COREF> emissions of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">carbon dioxide</COREF> , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a prime suspect in the global atmospheric warming 0 many scientists fear *T*-1</COREF> .
The Poles would plant <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">a 10 - square - mile forest</COREF> somewhere in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> at <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">a cost of $ 150,000 *U*</COREF> , with <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the center 's</COREF> developer</COREF> footing <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the bill</COREF> .
The news has n't exactly moved others in <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough 's</COREF> profession *PRO*-1 to become architectural Johnny Appleseeds .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">All architects</COREF> want *PRO*-2 to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> aware of the ecological consequences of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> work , says 0 *?* John Burgee , whose <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> firm *T*-1 is designing the redevelopment of Times Square , `` but <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> ca n't <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF> carry <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to that extreme . ''
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Karen Nichols</COREF> , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">senior associate at Michael Graves 's architecture firm in Princeton , N.J. ,</COREF> says : `` <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're really at the mercy of what the construction industry can and will do *T*-1 readily . ''
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough</COREF> responds : `` <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm asking <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> *PRO*-1 to broaden <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> agendas . ''
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The son of <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">a Seagram 's executive who *T*-2 was stationed *-1 in many countries around <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF></COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. McDonough</COREF></COREF> was born in Tokyo and attended 19 schools in places ranging from <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> to Shaker Heights , Ohio , before *PRO*-3 entering <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Dartmouth College</COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> earned a master 's degree in architecture from <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Yale</COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> interest in the natural environment dates from <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> youth .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> and <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father</COREF> still spend time each summer *PRO*-1 fly - fishing for salmon in Iceland .
*PRO* Living in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , made <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> sensitive to the limits on food , power and water supplies .
At <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first school in <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was thought *-1 a little strange for *PRO*-1 shutting off open water taps and admonishing <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> schoolmates *PRO*-2 to take only brief showers .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> and a <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Dartmouth</COREF> roommate established a company that *T*-1 restored three hydroelectric power plants in Vermont .
At <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Yale</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> designed one of the first solarheated houses 0 *T*-2 to be built *-1 in Ireland .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough 's</COREF> first professional project 0 fully *T*-1 to reflect his environmental ardor was his 1986 design for <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the headquarters of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the Environmental Defense Fund in <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">The offices</COREF> took 10,000 square feet of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">a building with 14 - foot ceilings and big , operable windows</COREF> .
Since the 1970s energy crisis , some efforts *PRO* to conserve energy by *PRO*-1 sealing buildings have had <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an unintended side effect</COREF> : <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">high indoor pollution</COREF></COREF> .
To reduce <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> at <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the fund 's</COREF> building</COREF> , workers rubbed beeswax instead of polyurethane on the floors in the executive director 's office .
Jute , rather than a synthetic material , lies under the tacked - down carpets , and the desks are of wood and granite instead of plastic .
The budget was only $ 400,000 *U* .
`` Athens with Spartan means , '' <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough</COREF> says *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The fund 's</COREF> lawyers work in an Athenian grove of potted trees .
Economists and administrators sit along a `` boulevard '' with street lamps and ficus trees .
In offices , triphosphorous bulbs simulate daylight .
Offices with outside windows have inside windows , too , *PRO* to let in more real daylight .
`` <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> proved 0 a healthy office does n't cost more , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Frederic Krupp</COREF> , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">executive director of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the fund</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> `` really looks beautiful and is very light , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="46" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ann Hornaday</COREF> , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a free - lance writer who *T*-1 has visited <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the office</COREF> for lunch meetings</COREF></COREF> .
But , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> says , `` <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guess 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't really notice <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the trees</COREF> .
Maybe <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were hidden *-1 by all the people . ''
Neither <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the Quilted Giraffe</COREF> nor <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Paul Stuart</COREF> renovation</COREF> reflects much of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough 's</COREF> environmental concern .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">The restaurant</COREF> was conceived *-1 as a sparkling , crystalline `` geode . ''
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> makes extensive use of stainless steel , silver and aluminum that *T*-1 sets off black granite table tops and a gray terrazzo with zinc - strip floors .
*PRO*-1 To more than replace the wood from two English oaks used * for paneling at <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Paul Stuart</COREF> , however , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough</COREF> and friends planted 1,000 acorns around <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">The ambitious <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Warsaw</COREF> project</COREF> still awaits approval by city officials .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> developer is <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Polish American</COREF> , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sasha Muniak</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had worked with <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough</COREF> on an earlier project and recruited <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> as architect for <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the trade center</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">The center</COREF> will provide space for computer hardware and facsimile and other telecommunications equipment , not readily accessible in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> now , for a growing number of Westerners doing business in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Eastern Europe</COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. McDonough</COREF> thinks of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the center</COREF> as the `` Eiffel Tower of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Warsaw</COREF> '' and `` a symbol of the resurgence of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> . ''
If <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">any nation</COREF> can use environmentally benign architecture , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jessica Mathews</COREF> , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">vice president of World Resources Institute in Washington , D.C. ,</COREF> says that perhaps a quarter of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Poland 's</COREF> soil is too contaminated *-1 for safe farming because of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">air pollution</COREF> .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The pollution</COREF> is also killing forests and destroying buildings that *T*-1 date back to the Middle Ages .
The future of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the forest</COREF> remains uncertain .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Muniak 's</COREF> company</COREF> , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Balag Ltd.</COREF> , has agreed *PRO*-2 to set aside the money 0 *PRO* to plant and maintain <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-3 , but discussions are still going on over where *PRO* to place <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-4 and how *PRO* to ensure that <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be maintained *-1 *T*-5 .
After all , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Muniak</COREF> says , `` 0 in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> there are n't <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">too many people worried about the environment</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're more worried about bread on the table .
