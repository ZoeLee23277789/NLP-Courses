As a presidential candidate in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">1980</COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush</COREF> forthrightly expressed <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> position on abortion</COREF> in <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">an interview with <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Rolling Stone magazine</COREF> published * that March</COREF> .
What did <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> think *T*-1 of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court 's</COREF> decision legalizing abortion</COREF> ?
`` <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> happen *-2 to think 0 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was right , '' <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> said *T*-1 flatly .
A few months later , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> became <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Ronald Reagan 's</COREF> running mate .
Suddenly , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush the pro-choice advocate</COREF> became George Bush the anti-abortionist .
And the vacillation did n't end there .
Just a month ago , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> sternly <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">threatened</COREF> *PRO*-1 to veto <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">a pending welfare bill</COREF> if <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> provided any abortion funds , except *PRO* to save a woman 's life .
Then , two weeks ago -- *PRO*-1 declaring that `` <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not looking for any conflict over <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> '' -- <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would consider a compromise *PRO* to fund abortions for poor women in cases of rape and incest .
But only four days after that , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> resurrected <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the veto threat</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do not support federal funding for abortions except where the mother 's life is threatened *-1 *T*-2 , '' <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> proclaimed *T*-3 , and finally vetoed <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the measure</COREF> last weekend .
So what does <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush</COREF> really believe *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The answer</COREF> is so murky that <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is beginning *-1 to get <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">this popular president</COREF> in trouble with each of the increasingly vocal , increasingly powerful sides of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the abortion issue</COREF> .
The result is mistrust and criticism from all around .
Anti-abortion forces regard <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> as at best an uncertain ally .
`` In all honesty if you ask <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , ` Is <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">this man</COREF> a true believer ? ' <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Fowler</COREF> , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">head of the <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Washington - based</COREF> Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Inc</COREF></COREF> .
Yet abortion - rights forces remain bitterly critical .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Douglas Gould</COREF> , <COREF ID="69" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America</COREF> , calls <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush 's</COREF> position on <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the abortion - funding issue</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-2 `` extremely cruel , '' *PRO*-1 adding : `` <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">The guy</COREF> has n't done one thing about prevention .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's totally geared to <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">a punitive position</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> is plainly uncomfortable with the entire abortion question .
For most of the past nine years , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has striven *PRO*-1 to convince <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">anti-abortion activists</COREF> of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> stalwart support for <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> position .
But ever since <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court 's</COREF> <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services</COREF> decision this year</COREF> changed the political landscape of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the abortion issue</COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> seemingly has tried just as hard *PRO*-1 to avoid saying anything more unless *PRO*-2 pressed to the wall .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Many Americans</COREF> still agonize over <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own personal feelings about abortion .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush 's</COREF> problem</COREF> is n't so much *ICH*-2 that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> seems *-1 to be agonizing over <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> as <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is that he seems *-3 to vacillate on <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
The political risk would be far less if <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> drew <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">a firm line</COREF> and hewed to <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , experts insist 0 *T*-1 .
`` If you have <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">a position</COREF> , you 're better off *PRO* to stick with <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> than *PRO* to move around very much , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Republican strategist John Sears</COREF> .
The need for consistency is especially acute for <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush , who *T*-1 , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Sears</COREF> maintains 0 *?* , lacks a strong ideological base</COREF> .
By <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> moderate Republican heritage as well as the warnings of political advisers who *T*-1 say 0 <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> is vital to younger voters , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> might seem *-2 to have at least some sympathy with abortion - rights arguments .
Yet <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is also firmly bound by <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hard - line rhetoric and promises 0 <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made *T*-1 to anti-abortion activists during <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> long pursuit of <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> .
On many issues -- flag - burning , for instance -- <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> keen political sensitivities overcome such conflicts .
But <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> and <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> advisers miscalculated the politics of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the abortion issue</COREF> , *PRO*-2 failing *-3 to grasp how dramatically the abortion - rights movement would be aroused *-1 *T*-4 following <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">last summer 's <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> decision *PRO* to restrict those rights in <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the Webster case</COREF></COREF> .
`` It was one of the quickest changes in public attitudes 0 <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've ever seen *T*-1 , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">former <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> pollster Richard Wirthlin</COREF> .
These days , when others raise the subject of abortion *T*-1 , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the usually loquacious president</COREF> can be close - mouthed almost to the point of curtness .
Ten days ago <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was asked *-1 *PRO*-2 to amplify the reasons behind <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> anti-abortion stance</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> position</COREF> is well - known and well - stated , '' <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> replied *T*-1 .
A close look at <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> record over the last 15 years suggests that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> has well - stated <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> views -- on all sides of <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> .
In 1974 , as the U.S. representative to the United Nations , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wrote an introduction to a book on world population in which <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> boasted of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> leadership during <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> term in Congress in *PRO* expanding family - planning services for the poor *T*-1 .
*PRO*-1 Running for president in early 1980 , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was also quoted as *PRO*-1 supporting federal funding for abortions in cases of rape , incest and *PRO* to save the life of the mother .
In <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Rolling Stone</COREF> interview in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">1980</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> volunteered <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> abortion - rights remarks *PRO*-1 to contrast <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> with <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> rival</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ronald Reagan</COREF></COREF> .
In addition to *PRO*-1 supporting <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the landmark Roe vs. Wade <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Supreme Court</COREF> decision legalizing abortion</COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> opposed the constitutional ban on abortion that <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Reagan</COREF> was promising *PRO*-2 to promote *T*-3 .
As <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Reagan 's</COREF> running mate , though , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> plunged headlong into <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the anti-abortion position</COREF> , *PRO*-1 endorsing <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion</COREF> .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> acknowledged only one difference with <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Reagan</COREF> -- that <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the amendment</COREF> ought *-1 to have exceptions for rape and incest as well as *PRO* to save a woman 's life .
Throughout the early 1980s , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> was quoted *-1 *PRO*-1 sometimes supporting <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">federal funding for abortion in cases of rape and incest</COREF> and sometimes opposing <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
In April 1986 , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">then - Vice President Bush</COREF> had <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> staff write a letter spelling out that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would support <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">a constitutional amendment banning abortions except in cases of rape , incest and life endangerment</COREF> , but that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> opposed federal funding in all but the latter case .
At the GOP convention last year , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> again came out for <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">an amendment with exceptions for rape , incest and life endangerment</COREF> .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> rhetoric gathered momentum as <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> rolled into office , *PRO*-1 affirming <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> `` firm support of our cause '' during an anti-abortion rally three days after <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> inauguration last January .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> again urged passage of a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion .
But when the high court <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">ruled</COREF> in <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the Webster case</COREF> in July *T*-1 , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> began *-2 to lower the volume .
When <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the ruling</COREF> was handed down *T*-1 , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the vacationing president</COREF> dispatched Chief of Staff John Sununu *PRO*-3 to issue a statement and refused *PRO*-2 to answer questions <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did later threaten vetoes over legislation restoring <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the District of Columbia 's</COREF> right *PRO* to use <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own tax money *PRO*-1 to fund abortions for poor women and over *PRO* restoring funding to the United Nations Population Fund .
But in the months since then , while *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to drum up support for other issues -- such as an anti-flag - burning constitutional amendment -- <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has shied away from *PRO*-1 talking about abortion .
What few comments <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has initiated *T*-3 have been oblique , such as *PRO* urging `` greater efforts toward the protection of human life '' at a meeting of Catholic lawyers in Boston last month .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">The White House</COREF> has likewise avoided any involvement in <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Florida 's recent special legislative session on abortion , which <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">anti-abortion forces</COREF> *T*-1 had regarded *-2 as a key test of <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ability *PRO* to get state lawmakers to toughen abortion restrictions</COREF> .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">The session</COREF> failed *-1 to enact any new curbs .
Now , some see <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> trapped *-3 in a position 0 <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is neither comfortable with *T*-1 nor able *PRO*-2 to escape *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ken Ruberg</COREF> , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">head of <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Republican Mainstream Committee</COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a group of party moderates</COREF> ,</COREF> observes : `` <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The administration</COREF> finds <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> in an ideological cul de sac that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will find it *EXP*-1 difficult -- if not impossible -- *PRO* to get <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> out of *T*-2 .
