When the news *ICH*-1 broke of an attempted coup in Panama two weeks ago *T*-2 , <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Christopher Dodd</COREF> called <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the State Department</COREF> for a briefing .
`` <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">said</COREF> , ` *PRO* follow <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> , ' '' <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> told reporters *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> shows how far <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Ted Turner 's Cable News Network</COREF> has come *T*-2 since <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> birth nine years ago , when <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was considered *-1 the laughingstock of television news *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> niche as the `` network of record '' during major crises draws elite audiences around <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> .
But for all <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> success , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> has hit a plateau .
Although <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">viewership</COREF> soars when big news breaks *T*-1 , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ebbs during periods of calm .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> executives worry that the <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">network</COREF> 's punchy but repetitive news format may be getting stale and wo n't keep viewers *PRO*-2 coming back as the alternatives *ICH*-1 multiply for news and information on cable - TV .
`` Just the fact 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're on 24 hours is no longer bulletin , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ed Turner</COREF> , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> 's executive vice president , news gathering -LRB- and no relation to Ted Turner -RRB-</COREF> .
`` You ca n't live on that . ''
So <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> , a unit of Atlanta - based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. ,</COREF> is trying *PRO*-2 to reposition <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call *T*-1 *PRO*-3 a `` top of mind '' network .
Tonight , *PRO*-1 to kick off the effort , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> will premiere <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> first prime - time newscast</COREF> in years , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an hourlong show at 6 p.m . Eastern time 0 *T*-2 to air head - to - head against the network newscasts</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">The show</COREF> will be co-anchored *-1 by <COREF ID="346" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="328" TYPE="IDENT">Bernard Shaw</COREF> and <COREF ID="329" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Catherine Crier</COREF> , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a 34 - year - old former Texas judge and campus beauty queen</COREF> who *T*-2 has never held a job in television or journalism</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">The new show</COREF> is perhaps the boldest in a number of steps 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> is taking *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to build audience loyalty by *PRO*-3 shifting away from <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> current format toward more full - length `` signature '' programming with recognizable stars .
*PRO*-1 To distinguish <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> is also expanding international coverage and adding a second global - news program .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is paying higher salaries -- after years of scrimping -- *PRO*-1 to lure and keep experienced staffers .
And <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is embarking on an expensive gamble *PRO* to break major stories with a large investigative - reporting team .
`` The next stage is *PRO* to <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">get</COREF> beyond the opinion leaders who *T*-1 use <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> as a point of reference *PRO*-3 to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="156" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jon Petrovich</COREF> , <COREF ID="156" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">executive vice president of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Headline News</COREF> , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> 's sister network</COREF></COREF> .
But <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> wo n't be easy .
Networks , like other consumer products , develop images in peoples ' minds that *T*-1 are n't easy 0 *PRO* to change *T*-2 .
It also takes money that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> has been reluctant *PRO*-1 to spend *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in specially *PRO*-5 to see *T*-4 .
And <COREF ID="185" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the cable - TV operators</COREF> -- <COREF ID="185" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> 's distributors and part owners</COREF> -- like <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">things</COREF> just the way 0 <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *T*-1 .
The repositioning bid is aimed *-1 at <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> 's unsteady viewership</COREF> -- and what *T*-2 may happen to <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as the cable - TV news market grows more competitive .
Already , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> is facing stronger competition from <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel</COREF> , <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">both</COREF> of which *T*-1 are likely *-2 to pursue more general news in the future .
In addition , many cable - TV systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced * by local broadcast stations .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to change <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> viewers ' habits .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> watchers are , on the whole , a disloyal group of channel - zapping `` grazers '' and news junkies , who *T*-1 spend <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">an average of just 26 minutes a day</COREF> *PRO*-2 watching <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> , according to audience research .
<COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's less than one - third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks *T*-1 .
The brief attention 0 viewers give <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> *T*-1 could put <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to cable - TV channels .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> 's viewer habits have been molded *-1 by <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> format .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> strategy in <COREF ID="wsj_2351-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the past</COREF> has been *PRO* to serve as a TV wire service .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> focused on *PRO*-1 building up <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> news bureaus around <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> , so as events took place <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could go live quicker and longer than other networks .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> filled <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> daily schedule with <COREF ID="281" TYPE="IDENT">newscasts called * *PRO*-1 `` Daybreak , '' `` Daywatch , '' `` Newsday , '' and `` Newsnight</COREF> , '' but <COREF ID="281" TYPE="IDENT">the shows</COREF> varied little in content , personality or look .
Now , the push *ICH*-1 is on for more - distinctive shows .
`` <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> goal is *PRO* to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="292" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="293" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Paul Amos</COREF> , <COREF ID="293" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> executive vice president for programming</COREF></COREF> .
Accordingly , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> is adding a world - affairs show in the morning because surveys show 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> global - news hour in the afternoon is among <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> most `` differentiated '' programs in viewers ' minds , says 0 *T*-1 <COREF ID="292" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Amos</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is exploring other original programs , similar to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> `` Larry King Live '' and `` Crossfire '' talk shows , which executives hope 0 *T*-1 will keep people tuned * in .
Then there 's <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">`` <COREF ID="322" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The World Today</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="322" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the prime - time newscast featuring <COREF ID="328" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Shaw</COREF> and <COREF ID="329" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Crier</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
Until now , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> has featured <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Hollywood gossip show during the key evening period .
But 70 % of the cable - television - equipped households that *T*-1 watch news do so between 6:30 p.m. and 7 p.m. , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> discovered 0 *T*-2 , so <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> wants in .
<COREF ID="292" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Amos</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="346" TYPE="IDENT">the Shaw - Crier team</COREF> will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> , at least for now , appearing *-1 similar to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> 's other newcasts .
Some in <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> are skeptical .
`` <COREF ID="358" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> find it *EXP*-2 hard *PRO* to conceive of people switching over to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> for what , at least in the public 's mind , *T*-3 is the same news , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="358" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="368" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Reuven Frank</COREF> , <COREF ID="368" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the former two - time president of NBC News and creator of the Huntley - Brinkley Report</COREF></COREF> .
The evening news is also slated *-1 as <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> 's stage for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> big push into investigative journalism .
In August , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> hired <COREF ID="391" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="386" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">award - winning producer Pamela Hill</COREF> , <COREF ID="386" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the former head of news specials at ABC</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="391" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> 's assembling a staff of about 35 investigative reporters who *T*-1 will produce weekly , in - depth segments , with an eye toward *PRO* breaking big stories .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> executives hope 0 the headlines created * by such scoops will generate excitement for <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> `` branded '' programs , in the way 0 `` 60 Minutes '' did so well for CBS *T*-1 .
That 's such a departure from <COREF ID="wsj_2351-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the past</COREF> that many in <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> are skeptical 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> will follow through with <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> investigative commitment , especially after <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> sees the cost of *PRO*-1 producing in - depth pieces .
`` <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 've never shown any inclination *PRO* to spend money on production , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="431" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="432" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Michael Mosettig</COREF> , <COREF ID="432" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a senior producer with MacNeil - Lehrer NewsHour</COREF> , who *T*-1 notes that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> is indispensable to <COREF ID="431" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> job</COREF> .
The <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">network</COREF> 's salaries have always ranged far below <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">industry</COREF> standards , *PRO* resulting in a less - experienced work force .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> recently gave <COREF ID="448" TYPE="IDENT">most employees</COREF> raises of as much as 15 % , but <COREF ID="448" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're still drastically underpaid *-1 compared with the networks .
Says *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="431" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mosettig</COREF> : `` <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> is <COREF ID="431" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> wire service ; <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're on top of everything .
But *PRO*-1 to improve , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've really got *-1 to make the investment in people . ''
In any case , <COREF ID="472" TYPE="IDENT">cable - TV - system operators</COREF> have reason 0 *PRO* to fear any tinkering with <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> 's format *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="472" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> market cable - TV on the very grazing opportunities 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">CNN</COREF> seeks *PRO*-1 to discourage *T*-2 .
`` <COREF ID="479" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> would obviously be upset if those kinds of services evolved into more general - interest , long - format programming , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="485" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Robert Stengel</COREF> , <COREF ID="485" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">senior vice president , programming ,</COREF> of <COREF ID="479" TYPE="IDENT">Continental Cablevision Inc. , which *T*-1 holds a 2 % stake in Turner Broadcasting</COREF> .
