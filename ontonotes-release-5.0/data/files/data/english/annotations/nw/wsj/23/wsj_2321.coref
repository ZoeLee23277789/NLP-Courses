With economic tension between <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> worsening , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">many Japanese</COREF> had feared last week 's visit from <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills</COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> expected a new barrage of demands that <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> do something quickly *PRO*-1 to reduce <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> trade surplus with <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF></COREF> .
Instead , <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> got a discussion of the need for <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> to work together and of the importance of the long - term view .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Hills '</COREF> first trip to <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> as <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> 's chief trade negotiator</COREF></COREF> had a completely different tone from last month 's visit by <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher</COREF> .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mosbacher</COREF> called for <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">concrete results</COREF> by <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">next spring</COREF> in negotiations over fundamental Japanese business practices that *T*-1 supposedly inhibit free trade .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">such results</COREF> should be `` measurable in dollars and cents '' in *PRO* reducing the U.S. trade deficit with <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Hills</COREF> , *PRO*-1 speaking at a breakfast meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> on Saturday , stressed that <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the objective</COREF> `` is not *PRO* to get definitive action by <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">spring</COREF> or summer , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is rather *PRO* to have a blueprint for action . ''
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> added that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">expected</COREF> `` *-1 perhaps to have <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a down payment</COREF> ... <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">some small step 0 *T*-2 to convince <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the American people</COREF> and <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese people</COREF> that we 're moving in earnest</COREF> . ''
How <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">such remarks</COREF> translate into policy *T*-1 wo n't become clear for months .
American and Japanese officials offered several theories for <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the difference in approach betwen <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mosbacher</COREF> and <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Hills</COREF></COREF> .
Many called <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 simply a contrast in styles .
But some saw <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as a classic negotiating tactic .
Others said 0 <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="wsj_2321-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> may feel 0 the rhetoric on both sides is getting out of hand .
And some said 0 <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> reflected the growing debate in Washington over *PRO* pursuing free trade with <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> versus some kind of managed trade .
*PRO*-1 Asked *-2 *PRO*-3 to compare <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> visit</COREF> to <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mosbacher 's</COREF> , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Hills</COREF> replied : 0 `` <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> did n't hear every word 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> spoke *T*-4 , but as a general proposition , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have a very consistent trade strategy in <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="wsj_2321-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration</COREF> . ''
Yet more than one American official who *T*-1 sat in with <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> during three days of talks with Japanese officials said 0 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> tone often was surprisingly `` conciliatory . ''
`` <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> line has been very consistent , '' <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Hills</COREF> said *T*-1 at <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">a news conference</COREF> Saturday afternoon .
`` <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am painted *-1 sometimes as ferocious , perhaps because <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have a ferocious list of statutes 0 *PRO* to implement *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't feel very ferocious .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't feel either hard or soft .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> feel committed to the program of *PRO* opening markets and expanding trade . ''
When <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> met the local press for the first time on Friday *T*-1 , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Hills</COREF> firmly reiterated the need for progress in *PRO* removing barriers to trade in <COREF ID="wsj_2321-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">forest products , satellites and supercomputers</COREF> , <COREF ID="wsj_2321-E2" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">three areas targeted * under the Super 301 provision of the 1988 trade bill</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> highlighted exclusionary business practices that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. government</COREF> has identified *T*-1 .
But <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> main thrust was *PRO* to promote the importance of world - wide free trade and open competition .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the trade imbalance</COREF> was mainly due to macroeconomic factors and should n't be tackled *-1 by *PRO* setting quantitative targets .
At <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> news conference for Japanese reporters</COREF> , <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">one economics journalist</COREF> summed up the Japanese sense of relief .
`` <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> impression was that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> would be a scary old lady , '' <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 , *PRO*-2 drawing a few nervous chuckles from <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> colleagues .
`` But <COREF ID="217" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am relieved *PRO*-1 to see that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are beautiful and gentle and intelligent and <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">a person of integrity</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Hills '</COREF> remarks did raise questions , at least among some U.S. officials , about what exactly <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> stance *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 on U.S. access to <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese semiconductor market</COREF> .
The U.S. share of <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese market</COREF> has been stuck *-1 around 10 % for years .
Many Americans have interpreted a 1986 agreement as *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">assuring</COREF> U.S. companies a 20 % share by 1991 , but <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese</COREF> have denied *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="260" TYPE="IDENT">making</COREF> any such promise .
At one of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> news conferences , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Mrs. Hills</COREF> said , 0 `` <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe 0 we can do much better than 20 % . ''
But <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> stressed , 0 `` <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am against managed trade .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will not enter into an agreement that *T*-1 stipulates to a percentage of <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> .
