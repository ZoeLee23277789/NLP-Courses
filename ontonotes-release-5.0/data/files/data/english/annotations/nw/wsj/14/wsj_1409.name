Bureaucrats may deserve their bad reputation , after all .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthew Lesko</ENAMEX> , something of a professional defender of government , thought he had a sure - fire winner <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</ENAMEX> when he offered $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,000</ENAMEX> for the best `` verifiable story of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">250</ENAMEX> words or less about how a government bureaucrat helped you . ''
He sent out <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">thousands</ENAMEX> of news releases from his <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kensington</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Md.</ENAMEX> , office .
He plugged the contest on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry King 's</ENAMEX> radio show , on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pat Sajak 's</ENAMEX> television show and on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">C - SPAN</ENAMEX> cable television network .
He talked about it in every speech he made as he roamed the country promoting his books , which dispense handy how - to advice on using government information for fun and profit .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> figured he would be flooded with entries by now .
After all , he says , `` we 've got <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">like 15 million</ENAMEX> bureaucrats . ''
And in addition to the $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5,000</ENAMEX> , he has promised the winner a <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">`` My Favorite Bureaucrat ''</ENAMEX> plaque and offered each of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> runners - up $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">500</ENAMEX> .
So far , though , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> has received <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">only one</ENAMEX> entry .
To make matters worse , the lone nomination came from another bureaucrat : A woman from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance</ENAMEX> who nominated her boss .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> , who is making the rules as he goes , has determined that bureaucrats are eligible for nomination by other bureaucrats .
But he says he would prefer to get nominations from rank - and - file folks .
He admits that he has n't had much luck generating free publicity for his contest .
Newspapers , including this one , have generally ignored his news releases .
Talk show hosts quickly change the topic .
But Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> 's staff is beginning to wonder whether there is n't some larger phenomenon foiling the contest .
`` Is the government not helping anybody ? '' asks <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toni Murray</ENAMEX> , an assistant to Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> himself is n't yet prepared to accept that explanation .
`` People hate to write , '' he says .
`` Maybe people do n't believe I want to give this money away . ''
Maybe <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> are just so annoyed with government that they are n't interested in admitting that bureaucrats come in handy once in a while .
If he sponsored a contest on how a bureaucrat mishandled something , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lesko</ENAMEX> admits , `` I 'd get <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5,000</ENAMEX> entries . ''
Now there 's an idea .
