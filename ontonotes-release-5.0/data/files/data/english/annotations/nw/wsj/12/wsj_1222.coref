<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Residents of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">this city</COREF></COREF> soon will be seeing ads urging <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to visit <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">`` <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Cleveland 's</COREF> outdoor museum</COREF> '' -- <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lake View Cemetery</COREF></COREF> .
Despite such famous tenants as <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">oil magnate John D. Rockefeller</COREF> , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Lake View Cemetery</COREF> has fallen on hard times .
So <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the inner - city burial ground</COREF> is trying *PRO*-1 to resurrect <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> with <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">a television advertising campaign</COREF> .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">The ads</COREF> celebrate the achievements of some of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Lake View 's</COREF> residents .
A spot honoring <COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Bill White</COREF> , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the inventor of chewing gum</COREF> , shows <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">a woman</COREF> trying *PRO*-1 to extricate <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> high - heeled shoe from a wad of gum .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Another</COREF> focuses on <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Charles Brush</COREF> , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the first person 0 *T*-1 to light a city electrically</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> shows a boy hurling rocks at a street lamp .
Street lights , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the ad</COREF> points out 0 *?* , `` helped *PRO* sharpen the arm of many a budding baseball player . ''
Cemetery officials hope 0 <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the ads , which *T*-1 will begin *-2 airing next month ,</COREF> will not only draw visitors but bolster burials and endowment fund contributions .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Lake View</COREF> had an operating deficit last year and has a poor reputation as <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">an out - of - repair and crime - infested cemetery</COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">The private , non-profit cemetery</COREF> has had trouble *-2 competing against <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> for - profit counterparts , which *T*-1 use direct mail and other advertising *PRO*-3 to sell lots .
`` <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-2 to be known *-1 as ambulance chasers , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="44" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">William Garrison</COREF> , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Lake View 's</COREF> president</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> want people to think of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Lake View</COREF> as an historical park and educational experience ... .
A pleasant place 0 *PRO* to come and spend a few hours *T*-1 . ''
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Not all of <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the cemetery 's</COREF> better - known tenants</COREF> lend <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> to the promotional job at hand , however .
For example , <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">President James A. Garfield</COREF> *ICH*-1 is entombed *-2 <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">here</COREF> , the victim of an assassination in 1881 .
-LRB- <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Garrison</COREF> notes , however , that the <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Garfield</COREF> tomb is one of the nation 's premier examples of Romanesque architecture . -RRB-
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Rockefeller , buried * beneath a 180 - foot - tall granite obelisk ,</COREF> did n't seem *-1 right for an ad either .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">The oil magnate , who *T*-1 spent his later years *PRO*-3 passing out dimes *PRO*-4 to counter his penny - pinching image ,</COREF> `` is n't terribly amusing , '' says 0 *T*-5 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Barry Olson</COREF> , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">creative director at Innis - Maggiore - Olson , Canton , Ohio , which *T*-2 is producing <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the ads</COREF></COREF> .
But there are plenty of other promising prospects *ICH*-3 at <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Lake View</COREF> , promoters believe 0 *T*-2 : Ernest Ball , for instance , who *T*-1 wrote `` When Irish Eyes are Smiling *T*-4 , '' and <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Garrett Morgan</COREF> , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the inventor of the gas mask and the tri-colored traffic light</COREF> .
