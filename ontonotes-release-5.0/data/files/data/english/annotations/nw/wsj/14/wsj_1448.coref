<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">This city</COREF> is girding for gridlock today as hundreds of thousands of commuters avoid travel routes ravaged * by <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">last week 's earthquake</COREF> .
Estimates of damage in <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the six - county <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">San Francisco Bay</COREF> area</COREF> neared $ 5 billion *U* , excluding the cost of *PRO* repairing <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the region 's</COREF> transportation system .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Bay Bridge</COREF> , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the main artery into <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">San Francisco</COREF> from the east</COREF> ,</COREF> will be closed *-1 for at least several weeks .
Part of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the bridge</COREF> collapsed in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the quake , which *T*-1 registered 6.9 on the Richter scale</COREF> .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">The bridge</COREF> normally carries 250,000 commuters a day .
Also , most of the ramps connecting <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> main link to the south</COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the 101 freeway</COREF> , have been closed *-1 for repairs .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">The Bay Area Rapid Transit system , which *T*-2 runs subway trains beneath <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the bay</COREF> ,</COREF> is braced *-1 for <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">a doubling of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> daily regular ridership to 300,000</COREF> .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">BART</COREF> has increased service to 24 hours a day in preparation for <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the onslaught</COREF> .
Most unusual will be *T*-1 water - borne commuters from the <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">East Bay</COREF> towns of Oakland and Berkeley .
For the first time in 32 years , ferry service has been restored *-1 between <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the East Bay</COREF> and <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">San Francisco</COREF> .
The Red and White Fleet , which *T*-1 operates regular commuter ferry service to and from Marin County , and tourist tours of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the bay</COREF> , is offering <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">East Bay</COREF> commuters a chance *PRO* to ride the waves for <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the price of $ 10 *U* round - trip</COREF> .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">That tariff</COREF> is too stiff for some <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Financial District</COREF> wage earners .
`` <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll stay with <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">BART</COREF> , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">one secretary</COREF> , *PRO*-2 swallowing <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> fears about *PRO* using <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the transbay tube</COREF> .
Officials expect <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the Golden Gate Bridge</COREF> to be swamped *-1 with an extra load of commuters , including <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">East Bay</COREF> residents making a long detour .
`` We 're anticipating quite a traffic crunch , '' said *T*-1 one official .
About 23,000 people typically travel over <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the Golden Gate Bridge</COREF> during commute hours .
About 130,000 vehicles cross during a 24 - hour period .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Meetings canceled * by Apple Computer Inc. 's European sales force and by other groups</COREF> raised the specter of empty hotel rooms and restaurants .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also raised hackles of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the city 's</COREF> tourism boosters .
`` Other cities are calling -LCB- groups booked * here for tours and conferences -RCB- and -- not *PRO* to be crass -- stealing <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> booking list , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Scott Shafer</COREF> , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a spokesman for Mayor Art Agnos</COREF> .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">City officials</COREF> stuck by <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> estimate of $ 2 billion *U* in damage to <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the quake - shocked city</COREF> .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">The other five <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">Bay</COREF> area counties</COREF> have increased <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> total damage estimates to $ 2.8 billion *U* .
All estimates exclude highway repair , which *T*-1 could exceed $ 1 billion *U* .
Among the expensive unknowns are *T*-3 stretches of elevated freeway in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">San Francisco</COREF> that *T*-2 were closed *-1 because of quake - inflicted damage .
The most worrisome stretch is <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">1.2 miles of waterfront highway known * as the Embarcadero Freeway</COREF> .
Until <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was closed *-1 Tuesday , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had provided the quickest series of exits for commuters from <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the Bay Bridge</COREF> heading into <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the Financial District</COREF> .
Engineers say 0 it will take at least eight months *PRO* to repair <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the Embarcadero structure</COREF> .
As part of the quake recovery effort , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the city Building Department</COREF> has surveyed about 3,000 buildings , including all of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the Financial District 's</COREF> high - rises .
The preliminary conclusion from a survey of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">200 downtown high - rises</COREF> is that `` <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were incredibly lucky , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lawrence Kornfield</COREF> , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">San Francisco 's</COREF> chief building inspector</COREF> .
While many of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">these buildings</COREF> sustained <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">heavy damage</COREF> , little of <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> involved major structural damage .
City building codes require construction that *T*-1 can resist temblors .
In England , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Martin Leach</COREF> , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a spokesman for <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's of London</COREF></COREF></COREF> , said 0 <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the insurance market</COREF> has n't yet been able *PRO*-1 to estimate <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the total potential claims from <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the disaster</COREF></COREF> .
`` The extent of <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the claims</COREF> wo n't be known for some time , '' <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Leach</COREF> said *T*-1 .
On Friday , during a visit to <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> 0 *PRO* to survey quake damage *T*-1 , President Bush promised *PRO*-2 to `` meet the federal government 's obligation '' *PRO* to assist relief efforts .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> officials plan *PRO*-1 to ask Congress for $ 3 billion or more *U* of federal aid , in the form of grants and low - interest loans .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">The state</COREF> has <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">a $ 1 billion *U* reserve</COREF> , and is expected *-1 to add $ 1 billion *U* to <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">that fund</COREF> in the next year .
Some of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">that money</COREF> will be available for highway repair and special emergency aid , but members of <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the legislature</COREF> are also mulling over a temporary state gasoline tax 0 *T*-1 to raise money for earthquake relief .
However , state initiatives restrict the ability *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the legislature</COREF> *PRO* to raise such taxes unless the voters approve in a statewide referendum .
