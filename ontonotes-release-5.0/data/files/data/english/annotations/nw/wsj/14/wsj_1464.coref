Bullish bond market sentiment is on the rise again .
As <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> prepares *PRO*-1 to release the next batch of economic reports , the consensus among <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">economists and money managers</COREF> is that the news will <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> negative .
And <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say *?* , will be good for bonds .
`` Recent data have indicated somewhat weaker economic activity , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Elliott Platt</COREF> , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of economic research at <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Donaldson , Lufkin -AMP- Jenrette Securities</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Platt</COREF> is advising clients that `` the near - term direction of bond prices is likely *-1 to remain upward . ''
Analysts insist that even without help from a shaky stock market , which *T*-1 provided a temporary boost for bonds during the <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Oct. 13</COREF> stock market plunge , bond prices will <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">start</COREF> *-2 to climb on the prospects that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the Federal Reserve</COREF> will allow interest rates to move lower in the coming weeks .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> would be comforting to fixed - income investors , many of whom *T*-1 were badly burned in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the third quarter</COREF> by *PRO*-2 incorrectly assuming that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the Fed</COREF> would ease .
Investors rushed *PRO*-1 to buy bonds during the summer as prices soared on speculation that interest rates would continue *-2 to fall .
But when it became clear that rates had stabilized and that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the Fed 's</COREF> credit - easing policy was on hold *T*-1 , bond yields jumped and prices tumbled .
Long - term bonds have performed erratically this year .
For example , a group of long - term <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bonds tracked * by <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co.</COREF> produced a total return of 1 % in the first quarter , 12.45 % in the second quarter and -0.06 % in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the third quarter</COREF> .
Total return is price changes plus interest income .
Now <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">some investment analysts</COREF> insist that the economic climate has turned cold and gloomy , and <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are urging clients *PRO*-1 to buy bonds before the rally begins .
Among other things , economists note that consumer spending is slowing , corporate profit margins are being squeezed *-1 , business confidence is slipping and construction and manufacturing industries are depressed .
At the same time , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">last week 's</COREF> consumer price index showed that inflation is moderating .
*PRO* Add <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it all</COREF> up and <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> means `` that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the Fed</COREF> has a little leeway 0 *PRO* to ease <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> credit policy stance without the risk of *PRO* rekindling inflation *T*-1 , '' said 0 *T*-2 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Norman Robertson</COREF> , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief economist at <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">Mellon Bank Corp. , Pittsburgh</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will see a federal funds rate of close to 8 1/2 % in the next two weeks and 8 % by <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">year end</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">The federal funds rate , which <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">banks</COREF> *T*-2 charge <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">each other</COREF> on overnight loans ,</COREF> is considered *-1 an early signal of changes in <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the Fed 's</COREF> credit policy .
Economists generally agree that <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the rate</COREF> was lowered *-1 by <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the Fed</COREF> from around 9 % , where <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had been since July *T*-2 , to about 8 3/4 % in early October on the heels of a weak employment report .
Although <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the rate</COREF> briefly drifted even lower following the stock market sell - off that *T*-1 occurred <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Oct. 13</COREF> , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ended <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Friday</COREF> at about 8 11/16 % .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">James Kochan</COREF> , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief fixed - income strategist at <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> is touting shorter - term securities , which <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *T*-1 should benefit more quickly than longer - term bonds as interest rates fall .
`` Given <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> forecast for lower rates , purchases made * now should prove *-2 quite rewarding before <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">year end</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Kochan</COREF> also likes <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">long - term , investment - grade corporate bonds and long - term Treasurys</COREF> .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">these bonds</COREF> should appreciate in value as some investors , reacting to the recent turmoil in the stock and high - yield junk bond markets , seek safer securities .
`` If <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the -LCB- <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Tennessee Valley Authority</COREF> -RCB- sale</COREF> is any guide , there appears *-1 to be good demand for top - quality , long - term paper from both domestic and overseas accounts , '' <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">TVA</COREF> , in <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> first public debt offering in 15 years , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">sold</COREF> $ 4 billion *U* of long - term and intermediate - term securities <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> .
Strong investor demand prompted <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the utility</COREF> *PRO*-1 to boost the size of the issue from $ 3 billion *U* .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">TVA , which *T*-1 operates one of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the nation 's</COREF> largest electric power systems ,</COREF> is a corporation owned * by <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the federal government</COREF> .
But *PRO* persuading investors *PRO*-2 to buy bonds may be especially tough <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">this week , when <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. government</COREF> will auction more than $ 30 billion *U* of new securities *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury Department</COREF> will sell $ 15.6 billion *U* of three - month and six - month bills at the regular weekly auction .
Tomorrow , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury</COREF> will sell $ 10 billion *U* of two - year notes .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Resolution Funding Corp. , known * as <COREF ID="72" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Refcorp</COREF> , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a division of a new government agency created *PRO* to bail out <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the nation 's</COREF> troubled savings and loan associations</COREF> ,</COREF> will hold <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> first bond auction Wednesday , when <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will sell <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">$ 4.5 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds</COREF> *T*-1 .
All of this comes ahead of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> big quarterly refunding of the federal debt , which *T*-1 takes place sometime in November .
So far , investors have n't shown much appetite for <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Refcorp 's</COREF> initial bond offering</COREF> .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Roger Early</COREF> , <COREF ID="71" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a portfolio manager at Federated Investors Corp.</COREF> ,</COREF> said that yields on <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the so - called bailout bonds</COREF> are n't high enough *PRO* to attract <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> attention .
`` Why should <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> bother with <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">something that *T*-1 's an unknown</COREF> for a very small pickup in yield *T*-3 ? '' <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-2 .
`` <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not going *-1 to jump on <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> the first day 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> come out *T*-2 . ''
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> seems *-1 to be typical of many professional money managers .
When the size of <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Refcorp</COREF> offering</COREF> was announced *-1 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">last week</COREF> and when - issued trading activity began *T*-2 , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the bailout bonds</COREF> were yielding about 1/20 percentage point more than <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury 's</COREF> benchmark 30 - year bond</COREF> .
On <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Friday</COREF> , the yield was <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">quoted</COREF> *-1 at about 1/4 percentage point higher than <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the benchmark bond</COREF> , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">an indication of weak demand</COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">Some economists</COREF> believe that yields on all <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> securities may rise this week as <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> struggles *PRO*-1 to absorb <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the new supply</COREF> .
But once <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the new securities</COREF> are digested *-1 , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> expect investors to focus on the weak economic data .
`` <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">The supply</COREF> is not a constraint to <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Samuel Kahan</COREF> , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief financial economist at Kleinwort Benson Government Securities Inc</COREF> .
`` If one thinks that rates are going down , you do n't care how much supply *T*-1 is coming . ''
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Friday 's</COREF> Market Activity
Most bond prices fell on concerns about <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">this week 's</COREF> new supply and disappointment that stock prices did n't stage a sharp decline .
Junk bond prices moved higher , however .
In early trading , <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bonds were higher on expectations that a surge in buying among Japanese investors would continue .
Also *PRO* providing support to Treasurys was <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">hope that <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> might see declines because of the expiration of some stock - index futures and options on indexes and individual stocks</COREF> .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Those hopes</COREF> were dashed *-1 when <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> put in a relatively quiet performance *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bonds ended with losses of as much as 1/4 point , or about $ 2.50 *U* for each $ 1,000 *U* face amount .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">The benchmark 30 - year bond , which *T*-1 traded as high as 102 1/4 during the day ,</COREF> ended at 101 17/32 .
The yield on <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the benchmark bond</COREF> rose slightly to 7.98 % from 7.96 % .
In the corporate bond market , traders said 0 the new - issue market for junk bonds is likely *-1 to pick up following <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Chicago -AMP- North Western Acquisition Corp. 's</COREF> $ 475 million *U* junk bond offering <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Friday</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Today</COREF> , for example , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">underwriters at Morgan Stanley -AMP- Co.</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> expect *PRO*-1 to price <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">a $ 150 million *U* , 12 - year senior subordinated debenture offering by Imo Industries Inc</COREF> .
Traders expect <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> to be priced *-1 *PRO*-2 to yield 12 % .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said that a $ 150 million *U* senior subordinated discount debenture issue by R.P. Scherer Drugs is expected *-1 by the end of the month .
However , despite the big new - issue calendar , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">many junk bond investors and analysts</COREF> are skeptical 0 the deals will get done *-1 .
`` There are <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">about a dozen more deals</COREF> coming , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Michael McNamara</COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of fixed - income research at Kemper Financial Services Inc</COREF> .
`` If <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had this much trouble with <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Chicago -AMP- North Western</COREF> , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are going *-1 to have an awful time with <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the rest</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Last week</COREF> , underwriters were forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to postpone three junk bond deals because of recent weakness in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> .
And pressure by big investors forced <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Donaldson Lufkin -AMP- Jenrette Securities Corp.</COREF> *PRO*-1 to sweeten <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Chicago -AMP- North Western 's</COREF> $ 475 million *U* junk bond offering</COREF> .
After hours of negotiating that *T*-3 stretched late into Thursday night , underwriters priced <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the 12 - year issue of resettable senior subordinated debentures</COREF> at par *PRO*-4 to yield 14.75 % , higher than the 14.5 % that *T*-2 had been expected *-1 .
<COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">The coupon on <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF></COREF> will be reset in one year at a rate that *T*-1 will give <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> a market value of 101 .
However , the maximum coupon rate on <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> when it is reset *T*-1 is 15.50 % .
Debenture holders also will receive the equivalent of 10 % of the common stock in <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">Chicago -AMP- North Western 's</COREF> parent company .
`` <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">The coupon</COREF> was raised *-2 *PRO*-3 to induce some of the big players on the fence *PRO*-4 to come in , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">a spokesman for <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">Donaldson</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> put a price *ICH*-1 on <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the deal</COREF> that <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> required *T*-2 to get <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> done . ''
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">The spokesman</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> was sold out and met with strong interest abroad , particularly from Japanese investors .
In the secondary , or resale , market , junk bonds closed 1/2 point higher , while investment - grade corporate bonds fell 1/8 to 1/4 point .
