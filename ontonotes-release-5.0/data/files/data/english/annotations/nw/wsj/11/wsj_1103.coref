<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Boston Co.</COREF> , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the upper - crust financial services concern that *T*-2 was rocked *-1 by <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">a management scandal</COREF> <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">late last year</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> has had a sharp drop in profitability -- mainly because a high - risk bet on interest rates backfired .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Boston Co. 's</COREF> fall from grace is bad news for <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> parent</COREF> , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc.</COREF> , which *T*-1 has relied heavily on <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the banking and money management unit 's</COREF> contributions in recent years</COREF> .
In 1988 , for example , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Boston Co.</COREF> had an estimated pretax profit of at least $ 110 million *U* , while <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Shearson</COREF> managed net income of just $ 96 million *U* .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Shearson</COREF> does n't break out the earnings of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> subsidiaries .
But people familiar with <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Boston Co. 's</COREF> performance say 0 <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the unit</COREF> had profit of around $ 17 million *U* for the third quarter , after *PRO*-1 barely breaking even for the first six months .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Shearson</COREF> , meanwhile , posted net income of $ 106 million *U* for the first nine months of the year , down slightly from $ 110 million *U* for the year - ago period .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Moody 's Investors Service Inc.</COREF> last week downgraded the long - term deposit rating of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Boston Co. 's</COREF> Boston Safe Deposit -AMP- Trust Co. subsidiary</COREF> , to single - A - 1 from double - A - 3 , *PRO*-1 citing <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">problems in <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">company</COREF> 's `` aggressively managed securities portfolio</COREF></COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Kriz</COREF> , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Moody 's vice president</COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Boston Safe Deposit 's</COREF> performance has been hurt *-1 <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> by <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">a mismatch in the maturities of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> assets and liabilities</COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">The mismatch</COREF> exposed <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> to a high degree of interest - rate risk , and when rates moved unfavorably *T*-1 -- *PRO* beginning <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">late last year</COREF> and continuing into <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> -- `` <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> cost <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Kriz</COREF> said 0 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Kriz</COREF> noted that <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">Boston Safe Deposit</COREF> `` has taken <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">some actions *PRO* to better control asset - liability management and improve controls in general</COREF> , and <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> will serve *PRO*-1 to improve credit quality . ''
As some securities mature and the proceeds are reinvested *-1 , the problems ought *-2 to ease , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *T*-3 .
But <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> also cited concerns over <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> mortgage exposure in the troubled New England real estate market .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Boston Co.</COREF> officials declined *PRO*-1 to comment on <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Moody 's</COREF> action or on <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the unit 's</COREF> financial performance <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> -- except *PRO*-1 to deny a published report that outside accountants had discovered evidence of significant accounting errors in the first three quarters ' results .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">An accounting controversy at the end of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF></COREF> forced <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Boston Co.</COREF> *PRO*-1 to admit 0 <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had overstated pretax profits by some $ 44 million *U* .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">The resulting scandal</COREF> led to the firing of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">James N. von Germeten</COREF> as <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Boston Co.

The executives were accused *-1 of *PRO*-1 improperly deferring expenses and *PRO*-1 booking revenue early , in an effort *PRO* to dress up results -- and perhaps bolster performance - related bonuses .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. von Germeten</COREF> , in turn , attributed <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the controversy</COREF> to judgmental errors by accountants and accused <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Shearson</COREF> of *PRO*-1 conducting a `` witch hunt . ''
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Kriz</COREF> of Moody 's</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the problems in <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the securities portfolio</COREF></COREF> stem largely from positions taken * <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">The company 's</COREF> current management</COREF> found <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> `` locked *-1 into this , '' <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *T*-2 .
