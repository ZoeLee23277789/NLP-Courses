*PRO* Reaching for that extra bit of yield can be a big mistake -- especially if you do n't understand what you 're investing in *T*-1 .
*PRO* Just ask <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="103" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Richard Blumenfeld</COREF> , <COREF ID="103" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a New Jersey dentist who *T*-1 considers himself `` a reasonably sophisticated investor</COREF></COREF> . ''
In <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">May 1986</COREF> , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld</COREF> gave <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co.</COREF> <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">about $ 40,000 *U* for <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">a federally insured certificate of deposit offering an effective yield of more than 9 %</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was a time when interest rates came down very rapidly *T*-1 , '' <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld</COREF> recalls *T*-2 .
Yields on five - year CDs at major banks were averaging about 7.45 % , and 10 - year <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> notes were paying less than 8 % .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">The CD</COREF> seemed like a great deal .
But nearly 3 1/2 years later , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the investment</COREF> is worth <COREF ID="121" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">about $ 43,000</COREF> *U* -- <COREF ID="121" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an amount that *T*-1 represents an annual return of just over 2 % on <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld 's</COREF> $ 40,000 *U*</COREF></COREF> .
The problem is that <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> bought *T*-1 for a retirement plan</COREF> was n't a plain vanilla CD .
Instead , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill</COREF> broker</COREF> put <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">a zero - coupon CD , which *T*-2 is sold *-1 at a deep discount to its face value</COREF> .
The difference between the price and the face value payable at maturity is the investor 's return .
More important , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD</COREF> was purchased *-1 on <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the secondary , or resale , market</COREF> .
Because <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD</COREF> had an effective yield of 13.4 % when <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was issued *-1 in <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">1984</COREF> *T*-4 , and interest rates in general had declined sharply since <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">then</COREF> , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">part of <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the price 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld</COREF> paid *T*-3</COREF></COREF> was <COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a premium</COREF> -- <COREF ID="108" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an additional amount on top of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD 's</COREF> base value plus accrued interest</COREF> that *T*-2 represented <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD 's</COREF> increased market value .
Now <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the thrift that *T*-1 issued <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD</COREF></COREF> is insolvent , and <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld</COREF> has learned to <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> surprise that <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the premium</COREF> is n't insured under federal deposit insurance .
The tip - off came when <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> opened a recent <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch</COREF> statement and found that <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD 's</COREF> `` estimated current market value '' had <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">plummeted</COREF> by $ 9,000 *U* in a month *T*-1 .
Several phone calls and a visit to <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> broker 's</COREF> office later , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the dentist</COREF> found out that <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the $ 9,000 *U* drop</COREF> represented the current value of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the premium 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> paid *T*-1 when <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> bought <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD</COREF> *T*-2</COREF> , and that the amount <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> n't insured *-3 .
`` <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is one thing 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was never aware of *T*-1 , '' <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> assumed that principal and interest were `` fully insured *-1 up to $ 100,000 *U* , '' <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> adds *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld</COREF> is n't unique .
Especially at times like these , when declining rates make it *EXP*-1 hard for <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">investors</COREF> to get yields 0 <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have come *PRO*-3 to expect *T*-2 *T*-5 , too many people chase the promise of above - market returns without *PRO*-4 fully appreciating the risk .
`` Yield greed often gets in the way of *PRO* understanding things , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="111" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Markese</COREF> , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">research director of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="112" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the American Association of Individual Investors</COREF> , <COREF ID="112" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Chicago - based educational group</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` The biggest problem 0 <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *T*-1 is that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">investors</COREF> realize , after the fact , that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't understand what <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were investing in *T*-2 . ''
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld</COREF> concedes 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't fully understand what <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was buying *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says that <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knew 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was getting <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">a zero - coupon CD</COREF> and that <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had previously invested in <COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">TIGRs</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Treasury Income Growth Receipts</COREF> -RRB- , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a type of zero - coupon <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> security sold * by <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch</COREF></COREF> .
But <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't understand 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was buying <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD</COREF> on <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the secondary market</COREF> , and <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> contends 0 <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> broker</COREF> never fully explained the risks .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="115" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The broker</COREF> , <COREF ID="115" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Thomas Beairsto of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch 's</COREF> Morristown , N.J. , office</COREF> ,</COREF> refuses *PRO*-1 to discuss the matter with a reporter , *PRO*-1 referring inquiries to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch</COREF> officials in New York</COREF> .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Those officials</COREF> say 0 there was full disclosure of the risks in <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">a `` fact sheet '' sent * to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">all CD investors</COREF> with <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> confirmation of sale</COREF> .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">The fact sheet , dated * April 1986 ,</COREF> says on page three : `` If the price paid * for a CD purchased * in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the secondary market</COREF> ... is higher than the accreted value in the case of zero - coupon CDs , the difference ... is not insured *-1 ... .
Computations involving zero - coupon CDs are more complicated and you should discuss any questions 0 you may have *T*-1 with your financial consultant . ''
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't remember the paragraph about premiums in <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the fact sheet 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> received *T*-2</COREF> and did n't realize 0 <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">part of what <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> paid *T*-1</COREF> was a premium .
`` <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> assumed 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was buying a CD as a CD , '' <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
Nevertheless , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch</COREF> has agreed that if <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the thrift that *T*-2 issued <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld 's</COREF> CD</COREF> , <COREF ID="116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Peoples Heritage Federal Savings -AMP- Loan Association in Salina , Kan. ,</COREF></COREF> is liquidated *-1 and <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the CD</COREF> terminated *-4 , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the brokerage firm</COREF> would <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">cover</COREF> <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the premium 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld</COREF> paid *T*-3</COREF> .
-LRB- Federal deposit insurance would pay principal and interest accrued * to the date of liquidation , to a maximum of $ 100,000 *U* . -RRB-
`` <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's not a blanket commitment , <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a case - by - case situation , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Albert Disposti</COREF> , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a managing director of <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc</COREF></COREF> .
`` There 's a question whether brokers at the time were fully aware '' of the risks .
`` <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> were n't sure that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">full disclosure</COREF> , as <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> wanted <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , was being made *-1 . ''
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch</COREF> says 0 it *EXP*-1 's impossible *PRO* to estimate how many investors *T*-2 are in <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld 's</COREF> situation , although <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the firm</COREF> has received only one other complaint about premiums on <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the secondary market</COREF> in three years .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch</COREF> now provides credit rating information about the institutions whose CDs <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> sells *T*-1 , which <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did n't provide *T*-2 in 1986 .
Zero - coupon CDs are only a small portion of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the $ 1 trillion - plus *U* in CDs outstanding</COREF> , and those purchased * on <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the secondary market</COREF> are an even smaller part of <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the total</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch</COREF> estimates that fewer than 10 financial institutions currently issue zero - coupon CDs .
Still , there are several billion dollars of zero - coupon CDs with various maturities outstanding .
Because of the tax consequences of zero - coupon investments -- income tax is payable in the year 0 interest is accrued *-1 *T*-2 , although interest is n't actually paid *-3 until maturity -- zero - coupon CDs are usually sold for tax - advantaged accounts *PRO*-4 to finance things like retirement and children 's education .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Most zero - coupon CDs</COREF> are in maturities of six to nine years , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> usually double in value by maturity .
But investors who *T*-1 bought zero - coupon CDs in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the secondary market</COREF> are n't the only ones who *T*-2 may be surprised *PRO*-3 to learn 0 the full amount of their investments is n't insured *-4 .
People who *T*-1 paid <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">a premium</COREF> for <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">standard CDs purchased * on <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the secondary market</COREF></COREF> could also find that <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">those premiums</COREF> are n't insured *-3 if the institutions that *T*-2 issued <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the CDs</COREF> failed .
However , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">those premiums</COREF> are usually far smaller than on zero - coupon CDs , and the simpler pricing structure of a standard CD makes it more apparent when a premium is paid *-3 *T*-1 .
Whatever the case , a <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch</COREF> spokesman emphasizes 0 *?* , investors should n't have *-4 to worry about the uninsured premium issue , unless <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the bank or thrift that *T*-2 issued the CD</COREF> is closed *-1 and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> deposits paid *-5 off before maturity or transferred to another institution at a lower rate .
<COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">Dr. Blumenfeld</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's satisfied that <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> problem has been resolved *-1 .
And <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's learned a lesson : `` You always have *-1 to watch out for yourself .
No one else will watch out for you .
