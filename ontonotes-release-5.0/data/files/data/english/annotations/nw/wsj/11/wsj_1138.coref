The Justice Department has distributed <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">these new guidelines for U.S. Attorneys prosecuting <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> cases</COREF> .
A related editorial appears today .
Under -LCB- <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> -RCB- , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> may seek <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a temporary restraining order</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">TRO</COREF> -RRB- upon the filing of a <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> indictment , in order *PRO*-2 to preserve all forfeitable assets until the trial is completed *-1 and judgment entered *-3 .
Such orders can have a wide - ranging impact on third parties who *T*-1 do business with the defendants , including clients , vendors , banks , investors , creditors , dependents , and others .
Some highly publicized cases involving <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> TROs have been the subject of considerable criticism in the press , because of a perception that pre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of property without due process .
In order *PRO*-2 to ensure that the rights of all interested parties are protected *-1 , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the Criminal Division</COREF> has instituted <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the following requirements</COREF> *PRO*-2 to control the use of TROs in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> prosecutions .
-LRB- It *EXP*-2 should be noted *-1 that <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">these requirements</COREF> are in addition to any other existing requirements , such as review by the Asset Forfeiture Office . -RRB- :
1 . As part of the approval process for <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> prosecutions , the prosecutor must submit any proposed forfeiture TRO for review by <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the Organized Crime and Racketeering Section</COREF> .
The prosecutor must show that less - intrusive remedies -LRB- such as bonds -RRB- are not likely *-1 to preserve the assets for <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">forfeiture</COREF> in the event of a conviction .
2 . In *PRO*-2 seeking approval of <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">a TRO</COREF> , the prosecutor must articulate any anticipated impact that <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">forfeiture</COREF> and <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">the TRO</COREF> would have *T*-1 on innocent third parties , balanced * against <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> need *PRO* to preserve the assets .
3 . In *PRO* deciding whether forfeiture -LRB- and , hence , a TRO -RRB- is appropriate , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the Section</COREF> will consider the nature and severity of the offense ; <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> policy is not *PRO* to seek <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the fullest forfeiture permissible under the law</COREF> where <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">that forfeiture</COREF> would be disproportionate to the defendant 's crime *T*-1 .
4 . When a <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> TRO is being sought *-1 *T*-5 , the prosecutor is required , at the earliest appropriate time , *-2 *PRO*-7 to state publicly that <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> request for <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">a TRO</COREF> , and eventual forfeiture , is made *-3 in full recognition of the rights of third parties -- that is *?* , in *PRO* requesting <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the TRO</COREF> , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> will not seek *PRO*-6 to disrupt the normal , legitimate business activities of the defendant ; will not seek through use of the relation - back doctrine *PRO*-6 to take from <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">third parties</COREF> assets legitimately transferred * to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> ; will not seek *PRO*-6 to vitiate legitimate business transactions occurring between the defendant and third parties ; and will , in all other respects , assist the court in *PRO* ensuring that the rights of third parties are protected *-4 , through *PRO* proceeding under -LCB- <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">RICO</COREF> -RCB- and otherwise .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">The Division</COREF> expects that the prosecutor will announce <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">these principles</COREF> either at the time 0 the indictment is returned *-1 *T*-2 or , at the latest , at the first proceeding before the court concerning the TRO .
