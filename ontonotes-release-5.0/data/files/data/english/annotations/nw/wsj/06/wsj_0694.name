We are deeply disturbed that a recent editorial stated that <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989</ENAMEX> '' was `` crafted primarily by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> Senators <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kennedy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harkin</ENAMEX> '' with a premise `` based on the presumption that most <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> are hostile to the disabled ... . ''
Perhaps even more offensive is the statement , `` It is surprising that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">White House</ENAMEX> inner circle would ally themselves with this crabby philosophy . ''
This legislation was not drafted by a handful of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> `` do - gooders . ''
Quite the contrary -- it results from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> of work by members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Council on the Handicapped</ENAMEX> , all appointed by President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> .
You depict the bill as something <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> leaders `` hoodwinked '' the administration into endorsing .
The opposite is true : It 's the product of many meetings with administration officials , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> staffers , advocates , and business and transportation officials .
Many congressmen are citing the compromise on <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the `` Americans With Disabilities Act of 1989</ENAMEX> '' as a model for bipartisan deliberations .
Most <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Council</ENAMEX> members are themselves disabled or are parents of children with disabilities .
We know firsthand the discrimination addressed by the act : to be told there 's no place for your child in school ; to spend lonely <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> at home because there is no transportation for someone in a wheelchair ; to be denied employment because you are disabled .
Your editorial mockingly entitles this legislation the `` Lawyers ' Employment Act . ''
For the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">43 million</ENAMEX> people with disabilities and their families , this legislation is the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Emancipation Proclamation</ENAMEX> . ''
