For <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay Pacific Airways</COREF> , the smooth ride may be ending .
The first signs of trouble came last month when <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="36" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> carrier</COREF> , <COREF ID="36" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a subsidiary of Swire Pacific Ltd.</COREF> ,</COREF> posted a 5 % drop in operating profit for the first six months and warned that margins will remain under pressure for the rest of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF> *T*-1 .
Securities analysts , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">many</COREF> of whom *T*-1 scrapped <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> buy recommendations after *PRO*-2 seeing <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay 's</COREF> interim figures , believe 0 more jolts lie ahead .
Fuel and personnel costs are rising , and tourism in and through <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> remains clouded by <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> turmoil since <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">June 4</COREF> killings in <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF></COREF> .
In addition , delivery delays for the first two of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">as many as 28 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Boeing</COREF> 747 - 400s that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the carrier</COREF> has ordered *T*-1</COREF> have raised costs because personnel had been hired *-2 *PRO*-3 to man <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the planes</COREF> .
And tough competition in the air - freight market is cutting into an important sideline .
There also is concern that once <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> reverts to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> sovereignty in <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">1997</COREF> , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> will be forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to play second fiddle to <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> often - disparaged flag carrier</COREF> , <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Civil Aviation Administration of China , or CAAC</COREF> .
`` The sense is 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> would never be in a position *ICH*-1 again where <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">everything</COREF> works for <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> the way 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did *T*-3 before *T*-2 , '' says *T*-4 <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rod Eddington</COREF> , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay 's</COREF> commercial director</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sarah Hall</COREF> , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an analyst at James Capel -LRB- Far East -RRB- Ltd.</COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 there is n't much 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> can do *T*-3 about <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">rising costs for jet fuel , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong 's</COREF> tight labor market , or the strengthening of the local currency , which *T*-2 is pegged *-1 to the U.S. dollar</COREF> .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">These factors</COREF> are further complicated *-1 by <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the airline 's</COREF> push *PRO* to transform <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> from a regional carrier to an international one , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Hall</COREF> says 0 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Hall</COREF> expects <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay 's</COREF> profit to grow around 13 % annually <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> and next .
In <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">1988</COREF> , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> earned <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">$ 2.82 billion *U* <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF></COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="53" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">US$ 361.5 million</COREF> *U* -RRB- on revenue of HK$ 11.79 billion *U* .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> is taking several steps *PRO*-1 to bolster business .
One step is *PRO* to beef up <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> fleet</COREF> .
In addition to aircraft from <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Boeing Co.</COREF> , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> announced earlier this year an order for as many as 20 <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Airbus</COREF> A330 - 300s .
The expansion , which *T*-1 could cost as much as US$ 5.7 billion *U* over the next eight years , will expand <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the fleet</COREF> to about 43 planes by 1991 , up from 30 at the end of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> , according to Sun Hung Kai Securities Ltd .
The fuel - efficient <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Airbus</COREF> planes will be used *-1 largely *PRO* to replace <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay 's</COREF> aging fleet of Lockheed Tristars for regional flights , while the <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Boeing</COREF> aircraft will be used *-2 on long - haul routes to Europe and North America .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> also is <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">moving</COREF> some of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> labor - intensive data - processing operations outside <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> .
Fierce bidding for young employees in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> is pushing up <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay 's</COREF> labor costs by 20 % a year for low - level staff , while experienced , skilled employees are leaving <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the colony</COREF> as part of the brain drain .
Some jobs already have been moved *-1 to Australia , and there are plans *PRO* to place others in Canada .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">David Bell</COREF> , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a spokesman for <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the airline</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the move</COREF> is partly aimed *-1 at *PRO* retaining existing staff who *T*-2 are leaving *PRO*-3 to secure foreign passports ahead of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">1997</COREF> .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> is working *PRO*-1 to promote <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> as a destination worth *PRO* visiting on its own merits , rather than just a stopover .
Although <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">June 4</COREF> killings in <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF></COREF> have hurt its <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> flights , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay 's</COREF> other routes have retained high load factors .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Eddington</COREF> regards *PRO* promoting <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> as an important part of *PRO* attracting visitors from Japan , South Korea and Taiwan , where the number of people looking *PRO* to travel abroad has surged *T*-1 .
There also has been <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">speculation that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> will be among the major private - sector participants in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> government 's</COREF> plans *PRO* to build a new airport , with <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the carrier</COREF> possibly investing in <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own terminal</COREF> .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> officials decline *PRO*-1 to comment on <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the speculation</COREF> .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Eddington</COREF> sees alliances with other carriers -- particularly <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay 's</COREF> recent link with <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">AMR Corp. 's American Airlines</COREF> -- as an important part of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay 's</COREF> strategy .
But <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> emphasizes that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> has n't any interest in *PRO* swapping equity stakes with <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. carrier</COREF> or with <COREF ID="63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lufthansa</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the West German airline with which <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has cooperated for about a decade *T*-1</COREF> .
Analysts believe 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> is approached *-1 for such swaps by other carriers on a regular basis , particularly as the popularity of share exchanges has grown among European carriers .
`` <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> think 0 alliances are very important , '' <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Eddington</COREF> says *T*-1 .
`` But <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'd rather put funds into our own business rather than someone else 's .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not sure 0 cross-ownership would necessarily make things smoother . ''
In a pattern 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> aims *PRO*-2 to copy *T*-1 in several key U.S. destinations , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> recently announced plans *PRO*-3 to serve San Francisco by *PRO*-4 flying into <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">American Airlines '</COREF> Los Angeles hub and routing continuing passengers onto a flight on <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. carrier</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll never have a big operation in the U.S. , and <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll never have one as big as us in the Pacific , '' <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Eddington</COREF> says *T*-1 .
`` But this way , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">American</COREF> will coordinate good extensions to Boston , New York , Chicago and Dallas .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 'll coordinate on this end to places like Bangkok , Singapore and Manila . ''
Asian traffic , which *T*-1 currently accounts for 65 % of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay 's</COREF> business , is expected *-2 to continue as <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the carrier 's</COREF> mainstay .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> has long stated <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> desire *PRO* to double <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> weekly flights into <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> to 14 , and <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is applying *PRO*-1 to restart long - canceled flights into Vietnam .
Further expansion into southern Europe is also possible , says 0 *T*-1 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Bell</COREF> , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the spokesman</COREF></COREF> .
While a large number of <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> companies have reincorporated offshore ahead of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">1997</COREF> , <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">such a move</COREF> is n't an option for <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> because <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would jeopardize <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> landing rights in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Eddington</COREF> emphatically rules out a move to London : `` <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> lifeblood is <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong</COREF> traffic rights . ''
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the airline</COREF> is putting <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> faith in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the Sino - British agreement on <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong 's</COREF> return to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF></COREF> .
A special section dealing with aviation rights states that landing rights for <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong 's</COREF> airlines , which *T*-2 include the smaller Hong Kong Dragon Airlines , will continue *-3 to be negotiated *-1 by <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Hong Kong 's</COREF> government</COREF> .
But critics fret that <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">post-1997</COREF> officials ultimately will be responsible to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Beijing</COREF> .
`` My feeling is 0 -LCB- <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> does n't -RCB- have a hope in the long run , '' says *T*-3 an analyst , who *T*-2 declines *PRO*-4 to be identified *-1 .
`` <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Cathay</COREF> would love *PRO*-1 to keep *-2 going , but the general sense is 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're going *-3 to have *-4 to do something . ''
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Eddington</COREF> acknowledges that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the carrier</COREF> will have *-1 to evolve and adapt to local changes , but <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> feels that <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the Sino - British agreement</COREF> is firm ground 0 *PRO* to build on *T*-2 for the foreseeable future .
`` <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 're confident that <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> protects <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> route structure , '' <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *?* , `` and <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> ability *PRO* to grow and prosper .
