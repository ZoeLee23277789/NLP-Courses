In <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland 's</COREF> rapid shift from socialism to an undefined alternative , environmental issues have become a cutting edge of broader movements *PRO* to restructure the economy , cut cumbersome bureaucracies , and democratize local politics .
Initial steps were taken *-1 at <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland 's</COREF> first international environmental conference , which <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> attended *T*-2 last month</COREF> .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">The conference , held * in Lower Silesia ,</COREF> was co-sponsored *-1 by the Environment Ministry , the Rockefeller Brothers Fund , and the Polish Ecological Club , and was attended *-1 by 50 Poles from government and industry , as well as Hungarians , Czechs , Russians , Japanese and Americans .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">The conference</COREF> was entitled *-1 *PRO*-4 `` <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Economic Mechanisms for Environmental Protection</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="79" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a significant departure from <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">East Bloc</COREF> usage , which *T*-2 recognizes <COREF ID="84" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">only one economic mechanism</COREF> -- <COREF ID="84" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">central planning</COREF> -- 0 *T*-3 to direct industrial behavior</COREF> .
Even more remarkably , <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> focused on emissions trading and similar market approaches 0 *T*-1 to address pollution , notwithstanding <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland 's</COREF> lack of functioning markets .
Why did <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">East Bloc</COREF> participants</COREF> unanimously endorse market - based pollution approaches *T*-1 ?
The answer lies both in <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the degraded environment of <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">these countries</COREF></COREF> and the perceived causes of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">that degradation</COREF> .
Like other <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">East Bloc</COREF> countries , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> possesses environmental laws more honored in their breach than in their observance .
According to a detailed report by Zbigniew Bochniarz of the University of Minnesota 's Hubert Humphrey Institute , 27 areas containing a third of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland 's</COREF> population are regarded *-1 as `` ecological hazards '' due to multiple violations of standards .
Norms are consistently exceeded *-1 at <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">60 % of nitrogen oxide monitoring sites</COREF> and 80 % of <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">those for dust and soot emissions</COREF> .
Four - fifths of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland 's</COREF> soils have become highly acidified ; 70 % of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> southern forests are projected *-1 to die by century 's end .
Between 1965 and 1985 , Polish waters fit for human consumption dropped from 33 % to 6 % of all surface waters , while those unfit even for industry use nearly doubled .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> produces about 20 times more soot and five times more sulfur dioxide and solid waste per unit of <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">gross national product</COREF> than does Western Europe *?* .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> mortality rate for males over 35 is about 50 % higher than West Germany 's , and 50 % higher in hazard areas than the national average .
Since 1978 , average annual growth rates for most pollutants have outstripped the growth of <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">GNP</COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Conference participants</COREF> saw these effects as *PRO*-3 flowing directly from -LRB- a -RRB- Marxist devaluation of environmental resources , which *T*-2 are not produced *-4 by labor ; -LRB- b -RRB- planned economies ' inability *PRO* to control pollution where enterprises are state - owned and penalties are paid *-1 by the government *T*-5 ; and -LRB- c -RRB- the continuing Stalinist emphasis on heavy industry for economic development , producing a far heavier and more wasteful use of energy and natural resources than in the West .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> repeatedly noted that environmental progress could not be secured *-1 without true ownership , genuine competition based on market factors , and the risk of bankruptcy if a business makes the wrong decisions .
The solutions 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> formally proposed *T*-1 included lead / sulfur taxes , conservation and recycling incentives , reforestation offsets , transferable pollution permits , an ecological bank 0 *T*-2 to finance pollution - reduction credits , and debt - for - environment swaps .
But <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> most fundamental recommendation was *PRO* to separate <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">industry</COREF> from the state , *PRO* making <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> fully accountable for pollution control .
A revolution takes more than conference manifestos .
Indeed , skepticism was amply captured *-1 by a joke told * by Poles at <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the conference</COREF> : `` The world must be coming to an end .
The Russians are talking peace .
The Palestinians are talking elections .
And the Poles are engaged *-1 in commerce . ''
But <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the implications of such a shift to market approaches</COREF> go well beyond the fact that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> is already working on nationwide emissions trades 0 *T*-1 to reduce smelter pollution , or that the Soviets plan *PRO*-2 to introduce marketable pollution permits in some republics next year .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Those implications</COREF> include : -- Privatization .
*PRO*-2 Faced *-1 with a $ 40 billion *U* foreign debt and skyrocketing inflation , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> must privatize industry and eliminate subsidies *PRO*-2 to stabilize <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> currency and qualify for international assistance .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Market - based pollution control</COREF> may consume some capital that *T*-1 would otherwise purchase state industries .
But <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could also accelerate `` marketization '' by *PRO*-1 reinforcing industrial accountability , breaking up state monopolies , giving managers a stake in solutions , and ensuring that modernization is not reversible for failure *PRO* to address environmental effects .
-- Least - cost solutions .
As conferees noted , scarce capital <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">means</COREF> 0 the costs of control must be minimized *-1 through a broad menu of compliance choices for individual firms .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> means simple , clear rules that *T*-1 secure the first large blocks of reduction , *PRO* deferring more complex issues such as risk .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">means</COREF> use of quantity - based pollution limits such as transferable permits , rather than price - based limits such as effluent fees .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's because quota - trained managers will likely respond better *ICH*-1 to quantity than to price signals .
-- Creative financing .
Even least - cost environmental solutions will require billions of dollars .
New types of financing must make funds available without *PRO* draining <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland 's</COREF> hard - currency reserves .
-- Democratization .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">East Bloc</COREF> pollution data typically have been state secrets .
While Polish data have been freely available since 1980 , it *EXP*-1 was no accident that participants urged the free flow of information .
For once information flows , public participation follows and repression becomes difficult *PRO* to reimpose .
-- Global reciprocity .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">One participant</COREF> prematurely declared that <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> has had a free market in goods but a planned economy for environmental protection , while <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> represents the opposite .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> point : It *EXP*-2 will be increasingly difficult for <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> to cling to command - and - control measures if <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">even the East Bloc</COREF> steps to a different drummer .
At the moment , <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Poland</COREF> resembles 19th - century Pittsburgh more than a modern industrial society -- with antiquated production , inadequate environmental management , and little ecological awareness .
But the continuing pressures for free - market economics suggest 0 <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the conference 's</COREF> vision was not all fantasy .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Levin</COREF> , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">former head of EPA 's regulatory reform staff</COREF> ,</COREF> adapted this from <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> November column for the Journal of the Air and Waste Management Association .
