<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard Co.</COREF> will announce today <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">a software program that *T*-1 allows <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">computers in a network</COREF> to speed up computing tasks by *PRO* sending the tasks to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">each other</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO*-2 Called *-1 *PRO*-3 Task Broker , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> acts something like an auctioneer among <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">a group of computers wired * together</COREF> .
If a machine has <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">a big computing task</COREF> , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Task Broker</COREF> asks other computers in <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the network</COREF> for `` bids '' on <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the job</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> then determines which machine *T*-1 is free *PRO*-2 to do <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the task</COREF> most quickly and sends <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the task</COREF> to that machine .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard</COREF> claims that <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the software</COREF> allows a network to run three times as many tasks as conventional networks and will run each task twice as fast .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">The new <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard</COREF> program</COREF> , said 0 *?* <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">analyst John McCarthy at <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Forrester Research Inc.</COREF> , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a computer - market research company</COREF></COREF> , `` is a key building block as people move to this new model of distributed processing . ''
In today 's computer networks , some machines often sit *PRO*-2 idle while others are overtaxed *-1 .
With <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard</COREF> program</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *?* , `` You get more bang for the buck 0 you 've spent *T*-1 on computers . ''
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">The program , which *T*-2 will be shipped *-1 in January 1990 ,</COREF> runs on the Unix operating system .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard</COREF> will charge $ 5,000 *U* for a license covering 10 users .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">The program</COREF> now works on all <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard</COREF> and <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Apollo</COREF> workstations and on computers made * by Multiflow Computer Inc. of Branford , Conn .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will sell versions *ICH*-2 later next year that *T*-1 run on Sun Microsystems Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp. machines .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">The Task Broker</COREF> differs from other programs that *T*-1 spread computing tasks around a network .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">A previously available program called * *PRO*-2 Network Computing System , developed * by <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard 's</COREF> Apollo division</COREF></COREF> , for instance , takes <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">a task</COREF> and splits <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up into <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">parts</COREF> , *PRO*-1 divvying up <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">those parts</COREF> to several computers in a network for simultaneous processing .
But programs in individual computers must be revised *-1 in order *PRO*-1 to work with <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">that system</COREF> .
Applications wo n't have *-1 to be rewritten *-3 *PRO*-3 to work with <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Task Broker</COREF> , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard</COREF> said 0 *?* , and the user of a computer wo n't be able *PRO*-4 to tell that another machine is doing the work .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">The Task Broker</COREF> `` turns that network into -- as far as the user is concerned *-1 -- one giant computer *ICH*-3 , '' said 0 *T*-2 <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Bill Kay</COREF> , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">general manager of <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Hewlett - Packard 's</COREF> workstation group</COREF> .
