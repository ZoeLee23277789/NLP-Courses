At <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's of <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF></COREF> , underwriters still scratch out policies *PRO*-1 using fountain pens and blotting paper .
Visitors are ushered *-1 into the premises by red - frocked doormen known * as waiters , a reminder of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the insurance market 's</COREF> origins in a coffeehouse in 17th century London .
Such trappings suggest a glorious past but give no hint of a troubled present .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="163" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lloyd 's</COREF> , once <COREF ID="163" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a pillar of <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the world insurance market</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> is being shaken *-1 to <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> very foundation .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">The 301 - year - old exchange</COREF> is battered *-1 by enormous claims from a decade - long run of unprecedented disasters , the most recent of which *T*-2 is <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">last week 's earthquake in California 's Bay Area</COREF> .
At the same time , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> is besieged *-1 by disgruntled investors and hamstrung *-1 by inefficient but time - honored ways of *PRO* conducting business .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">The exchange</COREF> is gradually being squeezed *-1 into narrow , less - profitable segments of <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> by less hidebound competitors .
`` <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> is on the ropes , '' says *T*-2 <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="164" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Peter Nutting</COREF> , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> investor for 17 years who *T*-1 now leads <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">a dissident group threatening *PRO* to sue exchange underwriters for alleged mismanagement and negligence</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> needs more discipline .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> needs *-1 to sort <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> out . ''
Most troublesome is *T*-1 the shrinking pool of `` <COREF ID="191" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">names</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="191" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the well - heeled investors</COREF> -LRB- some of <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> royal -RRB- who *T*-2 , as members of about 360 syndicates , underwrite policies</COREF> .
Some 1,750 members quit <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange</COREF> <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> , more than triple the number of resignations in <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">1987</COREF> .
Names are resigning at an even faster pace <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> .
Lackluster returns are one reason .
<COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">The average after - tax return</COREF> on investment</COREF> in <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">1986 , the most recent year for which results are available *T*-1 ,</COREF> was 6.5 % , according to <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="169" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Chatset Ltd.</COREF> , <COREF ID="169" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an insurance consulting firm in <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
In <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">1985</COREF> , <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was 2.1 % .
Between <COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">1981</COREF> and <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">1986</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="194" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the most recent five - year period</COREF> for which figures are available *T*-1</COREF> , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> reported <COREF ID="170" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">over # 3.6 billion</COREF> *U* in claims and reserves against future losses -LRB- <COREF ID="170" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">$ 5.7 billion *U* at today 's exchange rates</COREF> -RRB- , more than double the # 1.35 billion *U* posted * in the previous five - year period .
Many of the 31,329 investors who *T*-1 remain are beginning *-2 to question <COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange 's</COREF> most basic tenets</COREF> , <COREF ID="171" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the concept of unlimited personal liability</COREF> .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Investors</COREF> may reap huge profits when premiums exceed claims *T*-1 , but <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are liable to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> last pound or dollar in the event of a catastrophe .
And catastrophes are getting ever more costly .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> claims for the <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">1988</COREF> Piper Alpha oil - rig disaster in the North Sea , for instance , may reach $ 1 billion *U* .
During <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the five - year period ended * <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">1986</COREF></COREF> , roughly 80 % of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the names</COREF> had money tied up in money - losing syndicates , according to <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Chatset</COREF> consultants .
The peril of unlimited liability looms large for a number of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> now .
`` <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have wished 0 <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could die and be out of <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> -- that 's how bad <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-2 , '' <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="172" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Betty Atkins</COREF> , <COREF ID="172" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a secretary from suburban London</COREF> ,</COREF> says *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Atkins , whose <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> membership *T*-2 was a bonus from a former employer in <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">1981</COREF> ,</COREF> belongs to <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Nutting 's</COREF> dissident group on <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the Outhwaite syndicate</COREF> , which *T*-3 has been hard hit *-1 by asbestos reinsurance claims</COREF> .
<COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Atkins</COREF> , who *T*-1 underwrote # 20,000 *U* , or about $ 32,000 *U* , of insurance coverage on <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">that syndicate</COREF> ,</COREF> now faces potential losses of roughly # 70,000 *U* , or $ 111,000 *U* .

Unease is widespread among exchange members .
`` <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't think of any reason 0 *PRO* to join <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> now *T*-2 , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="176" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Keith Whitten</COREF> , <COREF ID="176" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a British businessman and a Lloyd 's member since 1979</COREF></COREF> .
`` The downside is very considerable , and at the moment the upside is very marginal . ''
If profits do n't improve , <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Whitten</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> may quit <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange</COREF> *T*-1 .
Meanwhile , competition from rivals unencumbered by history is intensifying .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> is being squeezed *-1 out of low - margin but more consistently profitable product lines such as primary property and marine insurance .
Over <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">the past decade</COREF> , competitors have chipped away at <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange 's</COREF> share of <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the # 2.5 billion *U* marine market in <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">London , where half the world 's ships are insured *-1 *T*-2</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> 66 % stake in <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">that market</COREF> has shrunk to 50 % in <COREF ID="177" TYPE="IDENT">that period</COREF> , according to <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">an official at <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="178" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Institute of London Underwriters</COREF> , <COREF ID="178" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> competitor</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
-LRB- <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">The official</COREF> asked *PRO*-1 not to be named *-2 . -RRB-
Much of the business has gone to <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the institute</COREF> , <COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an association of more than 100 insurers , including Cigna Corp. , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Allianz Versicherungs AG of West Germany</COREF> and <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Britain 's</COREF> Commercial Union Assurance PLC</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> has endured decades of genteel decline .
At the peak of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> power and influence a century ago , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> dominated <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the insurance world</COREF> with a 50 % stake .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> virtually dictated how ships were *-2 to be built *-1 *T*-3 and <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> monitored commerce through a unrivaled intelligence network in ports around the globe .
Today , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> share of <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the world market</COREF> , excluding life insurance , is about 2 % .
-LRB- <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> stake is even smaller if life insurance is included *-1 . -RRB-
Bigger rivals , such as Aetna and <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Allianz</COREF> , *PRO*-1 backed * by armies of statisticians using computers in hundreds of branches , operate more efficiently and often can offer lower rates , brokers say 0 *T*-2 .
Though <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> pioneered <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">such now - standard policies as worker 's compensation insurance , burglary insurance for homeowners and businesses , and bankers ' liability insurance</COREF> , competitors now underwrite most of <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">that business</COREF> .
Beyond that , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">many big oil , chemical and airline companies</COREF> are siphoning off big chunks of <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> by *PRO*-1 insuring <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> through `` captive '' offshore companies for industry - specific coverage .
<COREF ID="192" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Even <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> specialty</COREF> -- <COREF ID="192" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">unusually risky ventures</COREF> -- is being challenged *-1 .
Only 10 years ago , for instance , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> was the pre-eminent insurer of thoroughbred horses .
But since <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">1981</COREF> , Kirk Horse Insurance Inc. of Lexington , Ky. has grabbed a 20 % stake of the market .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="181" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ronald Kirk</COREF> , <COREF ID="181" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president</COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> has suffered because <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> structure does n't allow underwriters to deal directly with clients ; brokers are required intermediaries .
Thus , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> asserts 0 *?* , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> ca n't react quickly to competition .
`` <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> has lost control of the situation , '' <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are n't controlling <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> destiny like <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> used *-1 to *?* . ''
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="182" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Murray Lawrence</COREF> , <COREF ID="182" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> chairman</COREF> ,</COREF> agrees 0 <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange</COREF> faces big challenges .
`` This is a watershed time , and <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are trying *PRO*-1 to plot <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> way ahead , '' <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
`` <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have been a great market for *PRO* inventing risks which other people then take *T*-1 , copy *T*-1 and cut rates . ''
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , is cut off from `` the vast body of premium down at the bottom end which *T*-1 acts as a steadying influence '' against catastrophic losses .
By that , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> means low - margin but low - risk products such as certain types of primary property insurance .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">The exchange</COREF> , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , must <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">find</COREF> new products and new markets .
<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> wo n't be an easy task .
Tradition is dictator at <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> .
Three years ago , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange</COREF> took up residence in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">a space - age tower of steel and glass -- evocative of the kind of modern architecture that <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">Britain 's</COREF> Prince Charles has denounced *T*-1</COREF> .
-LRB- Some exchange wags call <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the building</COREF> *PRO*-1 `` the oil rig . '' -RRB-
But along with such treasured artifacts as Lord Nelson 's spyglass , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> also brought <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> outmoded ways of *PRO* doing business .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> market</COREF> actively underwrites insurance just 4 1/2 hours a day , brokers say 0 *T*-1 .
Underwriting does n't get under way until after morning tea at 10 a.m .
A two - hour lunch break follows .
Things wind down at about 4:30 p.m. , just in time for afternoon tea .
<COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> vast trading hall</COREF> houses a warren of well - polished desks .
<COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">The hall 's</COREF> few computers are used *-1 mostly *PRO* to send messages .
*PRO*-1 Sandwiched between desks , underwriters sit on benches surrounded * by stacks of policies .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Brokers clutching thick folders</COREF> stand in lines , *PRO*-1 waiting <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> turn 0 *PRO* to speak to the underwriters *T*-2 .
A broker may have *-2 to approach as many as 20 underwriters who *T*-1 insure the endeavors on behalf of the syndicates .
It *EXP*-2 could take six months for a claim to be paid *-1 .
`` <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The system</COREF> , '' says *?* <COREF ID="185" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Nicholas Samengo - Turner</COREF> , <COREF ID="185" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Lloyd 's broker who *T*-1 left <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange</COREF> in <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">1985</COREF></COREF> , `` is so ludicrously unprofessional 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> drives you mad . ''
Some maintain 0 underwriters also have been inept .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="186" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Wetherell</COREF> , <COREF ID="186" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Lloyd 's underwriter</COREF> ,</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fellow underwriters</COREF> underestimated by as much as 50 % the premiums 0 <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should have charged *T*-1 for property risks from 1980 to <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">1985</COREF> .
`` How unprofessional <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> must have appeared *-3 *T*-1 to the outside world -- how incompetent at risk assessment and evaluation , '' <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> officials decline *PRO*-1 to comment on the matter .
More recently , property rates have increased .
Many at <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> expect 0 <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the San Francisco earthquake</COREF> will cause the industry to boost rates even further .
But it will be years before it *EXP*-1 is clear whether higher rates will offset the payouts for such disasters .
The magnitude of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange 's</COREF> problems may not become known for some time because of <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> practice of *PRO* leaving the books *PRO*-2 open for three years *PRO*-1 to allow for the settlement of claims .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> only recently reported <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> financial results for <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">1986</COREF> .
<COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">That year</COREF> , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> posted <COREF ID="193" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">record pretax profit of # 650 million *U*</COREF> , <COREF ID="193" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a gain 0 <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> attributes *T*-1 to higher rates and fewer claims</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lawrence</COREF> says 0 reported profit will be down in <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">1987</COREF> , <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">1988</COREF> and <COREF ID="190" TYPE="IDENT">1989</COREF> , though <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> declines *PRO*-1 to specify how steep <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the decline</COREF> will be *T*-2 .
Insurance analysts say 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange 's</COREF> downturn in profitability</COREF> is likely *-2 to be aggravated *-1 by more than $ 600 million *U* in aviation losses -LRB- including the <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT">1988</COREF> Pan Am airline disaster over Lockerbie , Scotland -RRB- and a still - uncalculated chunk of claims from September 's Hurricane Hugo .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> says 0 the departures of names is n't likely *-1 to hurt <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> underwriting capacity , currently about # 11 billion *U* .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lawrence</COREF> says 0 the drain of funds has been offset *-1 by an increase in investments by the remaining names .
Meanwhile , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange</COREF> has been trying *PRO*-1 to lower costs .
-LRB- <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> recently cut <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> work force by 9 % , or 213 . -RRB-
But <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> is hampered *-1 in <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> efforts *PRO* to overhaul operations by <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> reluctance *PRO* to embrace modern technology .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Wetherell</COREF> , <COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the underwriter</COREF> ,</COREF> reckons 0 half of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> business could be transacted *-1 by computer , *PRO* cutting costs at least 10 % .
Though <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> has talked for years about *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">computerizing</COREF> underwriting transactions , <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the effort</COREF> has n't gotten very far .
Competition among <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">underwriters and brokers</COREF> makes <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> loath *PRO*-1 to centralize price and policy information .
<COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">Both groups</COREF> cling to traditional face - to - face dealings , even for routine policies .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> overblown bureaucracy also hampers efforts *PRO* to update marketing strategies .
Some underwriters have been pressing for years *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">tap</COREF> the low - margin business by *PRO*-2 selling some policies directly to consumers .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> presently sells only auto insurance directly to the public , and such policies are sold *-1 only in limited markets such as <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">the U.K.</COREF> and Canada .

<COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">The proposal *PRO* to sell directly to the public</COREF> remains mired in bureaucratic quicksand .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Lloyd 's</COREF> is moving forward on some fronts , though .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lawrence</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the exchange</COREF> is updating some procedures *PRO*-1 to make speedier payments on claims .
By next year , all underwriters will be linked *-1 to a communications network that *T*-2 could reduce paper work on claims .
