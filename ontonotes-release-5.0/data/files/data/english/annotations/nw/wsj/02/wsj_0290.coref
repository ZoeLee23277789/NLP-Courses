Hardly a day passes without news photos of the police dragging limp protesters from some building or thoroughfare in one of our cities .
Of recent note are *T*-1 the activities of the pro - and anti-abortionists , anti-nuclear activists , animal rights protesters , college students concerned about racism , anti-apartheid groups , various self - styled `` environmentalists '' and those dissatisfied with the pace of the war against AIDS .
Maybe <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't start <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , but <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Mohandas Gandhi</COREF> certainly provided a recognizable beginning to <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">non-violent civil disobedience</COREF> as we know <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> today</COREF> .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">The Mahatma</COREF> , or `` great souled one , ''</COREF> instigated several campaigns of passive resistance against <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the British government in <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">India</COREF></COREF> .
Unfortunately , according to Webster 's Biographical Dictionary , `` <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> policies went beyond <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> control and resulted ... in riots and disturbances '' and later a renewed campaign of civil disobedience `` resulted in rioting and a second imprisonment . ''
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am not a proponent of everything 0 <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Gandhi</COREF> did *T*-1 , but some of <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> law breaking was justified because <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">India</COREF> was then under occupation by <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">a foreign power</COREF> , and <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Indians</COREF> were not able *PRO*-2 to participate fully in decisions that *T*-263 vitally affected <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is difficult , however , *PRO* to justify civil disobedience , non-violent or not , where citizens have full recourse to the ballot box *PRO*-3 to effect change *T*-2 .
Where truly representative governments are safeguarded *-232 by constitutional protections of <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">human rights</COREF> and an independent judiciary 0 *T*-2 to construe <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">those rights</COREF> *T*-1 , there is no excuse for *PRO* breaking <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> because some individual or group disagrees with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
There may be a few cases where <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the law breaking</COREF> is well pinpointed and so completely non-invasive of the rights of others that it *EXP*-2 is difficult *PRO* to criticize <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 .
The case of <COREF ID="131" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rosa Parks</COREF> , <COREF ID="131" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the black woman who *T*-264 refused *PRO*-1 to sit at the back of the bus</COREF> , comes to mind as an illustration .
But most cases of non-violent civil disobedience are not nearly so benign .
The public has a tendency *PRO* to equate lawful demonstrations with non-violent civil disobedience .
It *EXP*-1 is true that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">both</COREF> are non-violent , but there is a fundamental difference between <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Lawful demonstrations , such as peaceful picketing and other assemblages that *T*-265 do not disturb the peace or cause a public nuisance or interfere with the rights of others , are rights guaranteed * by any truly free system of government .
Civil disobedience , violent or non-violent , is intentional law breaking .
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">The subject of this discussion</COREF> is non-violent civil disobedience ; but , before we get on with <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , *PRO* let <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> make just a few tangential remarks about <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">lawful demonstrations</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are useful *PRO*-1 to call public attention to grievances , but <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have little value in *PRO* educating anyone about the issues in dispute .
The delight of television in dramatic confrontation encourages overuse of slogans chanted * through bullhorns , militant gestures , accusatory signs and other emotionally inspired tactics .
Civilized discourse and an environment where compromise can begin *T*-1 are lost *-233 in a hostile posture abetted * by superficial media interviews .
At best , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">demonstrations</COREF> are overused and boringly uninformative ; at worst , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can become the stimuli that *T*-266 lead to law breaking .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">Demonstrations</COREF> are particularly apt *-2 to degenerate into criminal conduct when <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> leave the site of the grievance and become mobile *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">Petty criminals and street people looking for excitement</COREF> attach <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> like remora to the fringes of the crowd and use <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the protest</COREF> as an excuse for rock throwing , auto trashing , arson , window breaking , looting , pocket picking and general hooliganism .
Soon the whole purpose of <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the demonstration</COREF> is lost *-234 in mob mania .
There are better ways 0 *PRO* to promote a cause *T*-1 .
Where <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">non-violent civil disobedience</COREF> *ICH*-3 is the centerpiece , rather than a lawful demonstration that *T*-267 may only attract crime *T*-2 , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is difficult 0 *PRO* to justify *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Some</COREF> find no harm in <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the misdemeanors of trespass , minor property destruction , *PRO* blocking traffic and the like</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are small prices 0 *PRO* to pay *T*-1 for *PRO* galvanizing action for the all - important cause .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">The crimes</COREF> may appear *-1 small , but the prices can be huge .
Here are *T*-1 two cases 0 *T*-2 to illustrate .
*PRO* Assume a neighborhood demonstration 0 *T*-1 to protest speeding on a certain road or a careless accident involving a police car .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">The protesters</COREF> lie down in the street , *PRO*-1 blocking traffic , and will not move until the authorities carry <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> away .
*PRO* Assume that <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">someone</COREF> caught * in the jam</COREF> has a heart attack .
There is no way 0 *PRO* to get an ambulance in quickly *PRO* to move <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to a hospital *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> dies .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">The demonstration</COREF> was non-violent and involved only a simple misdemeanor , but <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> impact on <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">that individual</COREF> was violent and terminal .
*PRO* Assume that <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">a TV network</COREF> is airing <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">a celebrity interview program with <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">a live audience</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">The politician appearing</COREF> is highly controversial and has recently generated a good deal of rancor amid certain groups .
In a planned protest against <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> appearance , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">several members of <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the studio audience</COREF></COREF> chain <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> in front of the TV cameras in such a way that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the program</COREF> can not continue .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">The network</COREF> must refund money to the advertisers and loses considerable revenue and prestige .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">The demonstrators</COREF> have been non-violent , but the result of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> trespasses has been *PRO*-1 to seriously impair the rights of others unconnected with <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> dispute .
It might be alleged that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">TV</COREF> has done more than <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> share *PRO* to popularize and promote non-violent civil disobedience , so the second situation hypothesized * above would be simply a case of `` chickens coming home *PRO*-1 to roost . ''
Or maybe <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the TV network</COREF> would lose nothing .
Geraldo or Phil would probably pull up another camera and interview <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the chained protesters</COREF> .
*PRO* Let us look for a moment at another type of non-violent civil disobedience that *T*-268 only harms other people indirectly , yet does irreparable damage to the nation as a whole .
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am referring to <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">those young men</COREF> who *T*-269 chose *PRO*-1 to disobey <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> country 's</COREF> call to arms during <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Vietnam</COREF> war</COREF> and fled to Canada or some other sanctuary *PRO*-1 to avoid combat</COREF> .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> cowardly acts of civil disobedience , which <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> tried *PRO*-1 to hide *T*-2 under the cloak of outrage at <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">a war 0 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> characterized *T*-3 as `` immoral</COREF> , ''</COREF> weakened the national fabric and threw additional burdens on those who *T*-270 served honorably in <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">that conflict</COREF> .
Even more at fault are *T*-1 those leaders in *RNR*-3 and out of *RNR*-3 government who *T*-271 urged and supported <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">their defections</COREF> , *PRO*-2 thereby giving great help and comfort to the enemy propagandists .
It *EXP*-3 is amazing that the ensuing mass executions in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Vietnam</COREF> and Cambodia do not weight more heavily on minds so morally fine - tuned .
Worse , it *EXP*-4 remained to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">a well - meaning but naive president of <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF></COREF> *PRO* to administer the final infamy upon those who *T*-272 fought and died in <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">Vietnam</COREF> .
Under the guise of `` *PRO* healing the wounds of <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">President Carter</COREF> pardoned <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">thousands of draft evaders</COREF> , thus *PRO*-1 giving dignity to <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> allegations of <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the war 's</COREF> `` immorality . ''
The precedent having been set *-1 , who *T*-273 can complain if future generations called upon * *PRO* to defend <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> yield to the temptation *PRO* to avoid the danger of combat by *PRO*-2 simply declaring <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> immoral and hiding until <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is over ?
Finally , <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-1 important *PRO* to point out the extraordinarily high visibility of non-violent civil disobedience in these days of intensive media coverage .
*PRO* Give television a chance *PRO* to cover live any breaking of the law , and no second invitation will be required *-237 .
This brings into question the motives of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-274 lead civil disobedience demonstrations</COREF> .
Do <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want the spotlight for <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> or for <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cause ?
Here is *T*-1 a good rule of thumb : If the movement produced <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the leader</COREF> , the chance that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is sincere is much greater than if the leader produced the movement .
In either case , *PRO* ask yourself whether you have become better informed on the issues under protest by *PRO*-1 watching the act of civil disobedience .
If you have not *?* , it *EXP*-5 is probable that a thorough airing of the dispute by calm and rational debate would have been the better course .
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Agnew</COREF> was vice president of <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> from 1969 until <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> resigned in 1973 .
