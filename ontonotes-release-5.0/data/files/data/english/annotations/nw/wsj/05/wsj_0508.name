<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Lehman 's</ENAMEX> editorial - page article on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> as a haunted house omits the real roots of its ghost population -LRB- `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">In the Pentagon , the Undead Walk ,</ENAMEX> '' <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 18</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
The media 's treatment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Defense Department</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Vietnam War</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> administration 's denigration of the military , and the public scapegoating of Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver North</ENAMEX> have all served to emasculate the poor souls who live there .
The resulting haunted house tends to reward followership , not leadership , it creates guilt about wearing the uniform , and raises doubt about having the will to fulfill the ghosts ' role , i.e. , to be able to win if called on .
Perhaps <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Halloween season</ENAMEX> is a good time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> to be looking at funding for some ghostbusting equipment .

Where does Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> get off castigating Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Marshall</ENAMEX> for muscling in on naval prerogatives ?
Ever since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the days</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alfred Thayer Mahan</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">U.S.</ENAMEX> naval officer and naval historian -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Teddy Roosevelt</ENAMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> has been the service most favored by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington</ENAMEX> officialdom .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> overlooks the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> possesses its own air force -LRB- the carrier fleet -RRB- and its own army -LRB- the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Marines</ENAMEX> -RRB- , which in turn has its own air force .
Of course these turf battles are unseemly , wasteful and potentially dangerous and should be resolved in the interest of national security , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> seems to be part of the problem rather than part of the answer .

I agree with Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> !
Is n't this the same guy who resigned as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> secretary because he could n't get his <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,000</ENAMEX> - ship <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Navy</ENAMEX> ?
I personally do not want to hasten Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lehman</ENAMEX> 's demise , but I can see him figuring prominently in his own article .
