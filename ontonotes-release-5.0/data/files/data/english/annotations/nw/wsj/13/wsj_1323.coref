`` The croaker 's done gone from the hook --
damn !
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> language</COREF> sure goes to pot down here on <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the coast</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The husky blond guide</COREF> with the Aggie cap</COREF> twists <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> face in mock fury .
`` <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> got *-1 to get back to <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">school</COREF> and straighten out <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> English</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has two more years at <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Texas A-AMP-M</COREF> .
Right now <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> takes people out *PRO*-3 to <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">fish</COREF> in the bays behind the barrier islands that *T*-2 curve for hundreds of miles along <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the eastern coast of <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Texas</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-4 enclosing milky green lagoons behind ridges of sand and grassy scrub that *T*-1 rim the deep blue of the Gulf beyond .
There have been three days of hot , wind - swept rain , and now with <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the first sun</COREF> <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are after speckled seatrout , which *T*-1 with redfish provides most of the game fishing hereabouts .
The little radio fizzes as other boats want *PRO*-1 to see if <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have found any fish -- *PRO* spotting location is everything in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">this sport</COREF> .
Negative answers crackle back .
The fish often are plentiful around the pilings of the old gas wells that *T*-1 dot the flat surface like the remains of sunken ships .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> go from one to the other .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">The sun</COREF> is hot now though it 's only 8 in the morning .
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">The great silver clouds</COREF> on the horizon</COREF> build <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> on the pale water .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> cruise toward another set of pilings .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The guide</COREF> scoops into a pail and puts a frantically wiggling croaker on the hook .
Then <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> casts out .
`` *PRO* Just wait for <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">that tap - tap</COREF> , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">that thump - thump</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> comes real gentle before it pulls .
*PRO* Do n't forget , 0 trout have very soft mouths . ''
The radio queries again .
`` *PRO* Pickin ' one or two , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the guide</COREF> , *PRO*-2 chuckling .
`` You can tell 0 they 've got nothin ' . ''
A pair of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">black skimmers</COREF> zig - zag past close to the surface .
Soon <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have our limit of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the shimmering fish stippled in rose - gold and black</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are the first back at the dock , where the great blue herons stand *PRO*-1 waiting by the cleaning benches *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">The guide</COREF> is young and <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knows this business but <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wants a different life after college , such as *PRO* working for IBM and wearing a necktie .
<COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> must be the last big stretch of the American seacoast that *T*-1 is `` undeveloped . ''
There are a few ramshackle fishing towns with quiet atolls of resort houses nearby .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> are not apt *-1 to be self - conscious about <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the place</COREF> or <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">Texas</COREF> is big and beautiful and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">live</COREF> here , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's all .
Jutting out just to the north of <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> is *T*-2 <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the Blackjack Peninsula -LRB- after the oak , not the game -RRB- which *T*-1 forms the core of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the Aransas Wildlife Refuge</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is famous as the winter home of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the whooping crane</COREF> , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">that symbol of the destruction of wild America</COREF> .
Last year <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">a gunner</COREF> shot <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">a whooper</COREF> by mistake *PRO*-1 thinking that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was a snow goose .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> paid an immense fine and was lucky *ICH*-2 , according to a local wag , *PRO*-1 to escape the gas chamber .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">The peninsula</COREF> comes off the vast southeastern alluvial plain with fields of rice and cotton and sorghum as far as the eye can see *?* .
Near <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the coast</COREF> there are dense coverts of live oak interspersed * with marshes and prairies .
Deer , wild hog , armadillos and alligators are the glamour quadrupeds and the birds *ICH*-1 are innumerable , especially the herons and the spoonbills .
Above the blossoms of lantana and scarlet pea <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the inky - brown and golden palamedes butterfly</COREF> floats on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> lazy wingbeat .
Inland a few miles from <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the refuge</COREF> there is a place called * *PRO*-1 Tivoli , with a white church , a gas station and a grocery , the houses relatively close together for such a settlement in these parts .
`` <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Tivoli Motel</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> read a sign in the usual pronunciation of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the name</COREF> as <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> whoosh through .
`` Here in south Texas we say Tie - vole - ee , '' <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> host</COREF> gently corrects *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. King</COREF> is the director of the Foreign Press Center in New York .
