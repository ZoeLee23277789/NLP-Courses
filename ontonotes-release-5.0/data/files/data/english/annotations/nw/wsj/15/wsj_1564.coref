*PRO* READY *PRO*-1 TO REVIEW the riskiness of your investment portfolio ?
First , a pop quiz .
When you think of the words `` risk '' and `` investment *T*-3 , '' what *T*-1 's <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the specific peril that *T*-2 comes to mind</COREF> ?
Pencils down .
If you 're like most people , you said 0 it 's <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">a holding that *T*-2 goes completely sour -- maybe a bond that *T*-3 defaults or a stock whose value *T*-1 disappears in a bankruptcy proceeding</COREF> .
`` People tend *-1 to see risk primarily on <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">that one dimension</COREF> , '' says <COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Timothy Kochis</COREF> , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">national director of personal financial planning for accountants Deloitte , Haskins -AMP- Sells</COREF> .
But therein <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">lies</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">another aspect of investment risk</COREF> : <COREF ID="48" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the hazard of *PRO* shaping your portfolio *PRO*-2 to avoid one or more types of risk and being blind - sided *-2 by others</COREF> .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is clearly not good news to all you people who *T*-1 sleep like babies every night , *PRO*-2 lulled *-3 by visions of your money sitting *PRO*-4 risk - free in six - month CDs .
Risk wears many disguises , and investments that *T*-1 are low in one type of obvious risk can be distressingly high in other , less obvious kinds .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. Treasury</COREF> bonds</COREF> , for example , are supersafe when it comes to *PRO* returning money at maturity *T*-1 .
But <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> value as investments can be decimated *-1 by inflation , which *T*-2 erodes the purchasing power of bonds ' fixed - dollar interest payments .
Risk is also a function of time .
When <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">financial professionals</COREF> measure risk mathematically *T*-1 , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> usually focus on the volatility of short - term returns .
Stocks are much riskier than <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bills , for example , because <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the range in performance from the best years to the worst</COREF> is much wider .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is usually measured *-1 by the standard deviation , or divergence , of annual results from the average return over time .
But investors who *T*-2 are preoccupied *-1 with short - term fluctuations may be paying too little attention to another big risk -- *PRO* not generating enough money *PRO* to meet long - term financial and life - style goals .
For instance , some investors have <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">sworn</COREF> off stocks since the 1987 market crash ; last Friday 's debacle only reinforced <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">those feelings</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> , despite some stomach - churning declines , has far outperformed other securities over extended periods .
By *PRO*-1 retreating to the apparent security of , say , money - market funds , investors <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">may</COREF> not be earning enough investment return *PRO* to pay for a comfortable retirement .
`` <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's <COREF ID="56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the biggest risk of all</COREF> -- <COREF ID="56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the risk of *PRO* not meeting your objectives</COREF> , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Steven B. Enright</COREF> , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> financial planner with <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Seidman Financial Services</COREF></COREF> .
As a result , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">financial advisers</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> take several steps when *PRO* evaluating the riskiness of clients ' portfolios *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> estimate the return 0 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">a person 's</COREF> current portfolio is likely *-3 to generate *T*-2 over time , along with a standard deviation that *T*-1 suggests how much the return will vary *T*-4 year by year .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> try *PRO*-2 to figure out the long - term results 0 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the person</COREF> needs *T*-1 *PRO*-3 to meet major goals .
And <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> eyeball types of risk that *T*-1 are not easily quantified *-2 .
The portfolios of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">two hypothetical families</COREF> , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">a couple at retirement age</COREF> and another <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">a two - income couple at age 45</COREF></COREF> , illustrate several types of risk that investors need *-1 to consider *T*-2 .
For instance , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the insured municipal bonds that *T*-1 dominate <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the older couple 's</COREF> portfolio</COREF></COREF> were probably selected *-2 in large part for <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> low repayment risk .
But <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> expose <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the holders</COREF> to a lot of inflation risk and interest - rate risk .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">The younger couple 's</COREF> stockholdings</COREF> involve more risk than a diversified stock portfolio because the bulk of <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the money</COREF> is in a single issue .
*PRO* Note that <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the younger couple 's</COREF> portfolio</COREF> <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">has</COREF> <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a higher expected annual return</COREF> , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">10.1 % vs. 8.8 %</COREF> , as *PRO* calculated *-2 by <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Seidman Financial Services , which *T*-1 is the financial - planning affiliate of BDO Seidman</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> largely reflects the heavy stockholdings .
But one price paid * for <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the higher expected return</COREF> is greater short - term volatility , as *PRO* reflected *-2 in the higher standard deviation that <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Seidman</COREF> estimates *T*-1 for <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the younger couple 's</COREF> portfolio</COREF> .
-LRB- Here 's *T*-1 how *PRO* to interpret a standard deviation figure *T*-2 : *PRO* Take <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the expected return</COREF> and add one standard deviation to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Then *PRO* take <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the expected return</COREF> and subtract one standard deviation .
In two of three years , the actual result should fall within that range if all the assumptions were accurate .
Then *PRO* add and subtract two standard deviations *PRO*-1 to get a wider range .
There 's a 95 % probability 0 any year 's result will fall in the range . -RRB-
Of course , the greater volatility of <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the younger couple 's</COREF> portfolio</COREF> does n't necessarily mean 0 <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">those investments</COREF> are riskier in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">terms of *PRO* meeting <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the holders '</COREF> long - term goals</COREF> .
Indeed , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the older couple 's</COREF> portfolio</COREF> could actually be riskier in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">that sense</COREF> if the expected return wo n't generate enough dollars *PRO* to meet <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> spending plans .
`` <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> may feel emotionally secure now because <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are not heavily in <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John H. Cammack</COREF> , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a financial planner with Alexandra Armstrong Advisors Inc. in Washington</COREF> .
`` But <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may pay a price 10 or 20 years in the future . ''
Ms. Slater reports on personal finance from The Wall Street Journal 's <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> bureau .
When it comes to investing *T*-3 , *PRO* trying *PRO*-4 to weigh risk and reward can seem like *PRO* throwing darts blindfolded : Investors do n't know the actual returns that securities will deliver *T*-2 , or the ups and downs that *T*-1 will occur along the way .
*PRO* Looking to the past can provide some clues .
Over several decades , for instance , investors who *T*-1 put up with <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market 's</COREF> gyrations earned returns far in excess of those on bonds and `` cash '' investments like <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bills .
But while history can suggest what *T*-1 is reasonable 0 *PRO* to expect *T*-2 there 's no guarantee that <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the past</COREF> will repeat <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> .
For instance , some analysts believe 0 bond returns and volatility have moved permanently closer to those of <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">returns on cash investments</COREF> may continue *-1 to exceed inflation by a wider margin than <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did *?* over the long - term past .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Portfolio A : <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Retired couple , age 65</COREF> ; $ 400,000 *U* portfolio .</COREF>
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Portfolio B : <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Two - income couple , age 45</COREF> ; $ 150,000 *U* portfolio .</COREF>
