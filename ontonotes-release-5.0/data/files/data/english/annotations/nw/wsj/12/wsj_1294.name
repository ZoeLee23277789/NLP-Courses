The estimates of real gross national product prepared by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Bureau of Economic Analysis</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Commerce</ENAMEX> significantly understate the rate of economic growth .
Since the bureau 's estimates for the business sector provide the numerator for the productivity ratios calculated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Labor</ENAMEX> , underestimated growth rates artificially depress official productivity statistics .
If this thesis is correct , it has important implications for macroeconomic policies : It may lower the sense of urgency behind efforts to enact tax incentives and other measures to increase the rate of growth in productivity and real GNP .
It would also affect the perceptions of the board of governors of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Federal Reserve System</ENAMEX> , and the informed public generally , as to what constitutes a reasonable degree of price stability .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> , I predicted a significant acceleration in productivity growth over the rest of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the decade</ENAMEX> .
This forecast was based on the apparent reversal of most of the negative forces -- such as demographic changes , the oil shock and accelerating inflation -- that had reduced productivity gains in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1970s</ENAMEX> .
There has indeed been more than a <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> percentage point improvement in productivity growth since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</ENAMEX> .
But I had expected more , which is <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> reason I began looking at evidence suggesting defects in the official output estimates .
The evidence does not clearly support the view that the downward bias in output growth has become greater during the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1948 - 89</ENAMEX> period , but all I am claiming is that the growth trend is understated .
-LRB- It is , however , possible , that further study will reveal increasing bias . -RRB-
This bias is in no way deliberate .
The understatement of growth is due largely to the conservative expedients adopted to deal with deficiencies in basic economic data .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> major sources of error is the use of labor input estimates -LRB- mainly employment or <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hours</ENAMEX> -RRB- instead of output estimates for those sectors , such as governments , paid household services and private non-profit institutions , where there are difficulties in assembling output data .
This means that no allowance is made for possible increases in output per unit of labor .
In an unrelated program in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Labor Department</ENAMEX> does estimate output per employee for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than two - thirds</ENAMEX> of federal civilian employees , it found an average <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">annual</ENAMEX> rate of productivity improvement of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</ENAMEX> during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> .
Even if it is assumed that productivity rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">no more than half</ENAMEX> as quickly in the rest of the nonbusiness sector , this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Labor Department</ENAMEX> estimate indicates a downward bias in the real GNP estimates of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.2 percentage point</ENAMEX> a year , on average .
The federal productivity estimators use labor input , rather than output , data for their calculations of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> of private financial and service industries as well .
Independent estimates of output in those industries , including <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Department of Labor</ENAMEX> for banking , suggests that productivity in finance and services appears to have risen by an average of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 1.5 %</ENAMEX> a year <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">between 1948 and 1988</ENAMEX> .
Because finance and services contribute <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 %</ENAMEX> to final business product , missing these productivity improvements depresses the overall growth rate by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.15 %</ENAMEX> a year .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> source of error in growth statistics is the use of inappropriate deflators to adjust for price changes .
I estimate that these mismeasurements as detailed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Martin N. Baily</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert J. Gordon</ENAMEX> add a further <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.12 percentage point</ENAMEX> to the downward bias in the growth rate of real business product .
Finally , the official estimates understate growth because they make inadequate allowance for improvements in quality of goods and services .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</ENAMEX> , a new price index for computers adjusted for changes in performance characteristics was introduced , and that resulted in a significantly larger increase in real outlays for durable goods than the earlier estimates had showed .
Since then , further research argues that failure to take account of quality improvements has contributed a total of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">at least 0.26</ENAMEX> percentage point to the downward bias in the growth rate .
In sum , the biases ennumerated above indicate a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">0.7 percentage point</ENAMEX> understatement in growth of total real GNP .
For the private domestic business economy , the bias was a bit over <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">0.5</ENAMEX> percentage point .
In other words , the growth rates of both total GNP and real private business product per labor hour have been underestimated by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 20 %</ENAMEX> .
