*PRO* Place a phone order through most any catalog and chances are 0 the clerk who *T*-1 answers wo n't be the only one on the line .
Bosses have big ears these days .
Or *PRO* open up an electronics magazine and peruse the ads for sneaky tape recorders and other snooping gadgets .
Some would make even James Bond green with envy .
Eavesdropping -- both corporate and private -- is on the rise , thanks to the proliferation of surveillance technologies .
And while sellers of the equipment and companies `` monitoring '' employees have few qualms , right - to - privacy advocates and some lawmakers are alarmed .
`` New technologies are changing the way 0 <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> deal with <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">each other</COREF> *T*-1 and the way 0 <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> work *T*-2 , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Janlori Goldman</COREF> , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a staff attorney at <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the American Civil Liberties Union</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> expectation of confidentiality is being eroded *-1 . ''
On the corporate side , companies claim that *PRO* <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">monitoring</COREF> employee phone conversations is both legal and necessary *PRO* to gauge productivity and ensure good service .
<COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">The practice</COREF> is common at catalog , insurance and phone companies , banks and telemarketers , according to trade groups and worker organizations .
<COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's also widespread for reservations clerks in the airline , car - rental , hotel and railroad industries .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">The Communications Workers of America , which *T*-1 opposes such monitoring ,</COREF> says 0 supervisors listen in on an estimated 400 million calls each year .
Among companies saying 0 they monitor employees are *T*-1 United Airlines , American Airlines , United Parcel Service , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Nynex Corp.</COREF> , <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Spiegel Inc.</COREF> , and the circulation department of this newspaper .
Some Wall Street firms monitor for recordkeeping purposes .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Dictaphone Corp.</COREF> says 0 there 's a big business demand for <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> voice - activated taping systems , whether <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the sophisticated Veritrac 9000 system , which *T*-1 costs from $ 10,000 to $ 120,000 *U* and can record 240 conversations simultaneously</COREF> , or simple handheld units selling for $ 395 *U* .
Businesses `` want *PRO*-1 to verify information and ensure accuracy , '' says 0 *T*-2 <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="124" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Hiltunen</COREF> , <COREF ID="124" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Dictaphone 's</COREF> manager of media relations</COREF></COREF> .
The state of Alaska recently bought <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the Veritrac system</COREF> , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says 0 *?* , `` *PRO*-1 to monitor the Exxon cleanup effort . ''
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Merrill Lynch -AMP- Co. and <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.</COREF></COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> use voice - activated systems *PRO*-1 to record and verify orders between salesmen and traders .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Shearson</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has taped some of <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> institutional trading desks , such as commodities and futures , for about four years .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Both companies</COREF> stress that <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">employees</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are being recorded *-1 and that customer conversations are n't taped *-2 .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Kidder Peabody -AMP- Co.</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> monitors bond - trading conversations between brokers and customers *PRO*-1 to safeguard order accuracy .
Eavesdropping by individuals is harder 0 *PRO* to measure *T*-1 .
But devices are there for the asking , whether in stores or through the mail .
<COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">The Counter Spy Shop in Washington , D.C.</COREF> , for instance , offers <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the `` Secret Connection '' attache case , which *T*-1 can surreptitiously record conversations for nine hours at a stretch</COREF> .
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> and other fancy gizmos may cost thousands , but simple voice - activated tape recorders sell for as little as $ 70 *U* at electronics stores like <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Radio Shack</COREF> .
The most common use of spying devices is in divorce cases , say 0 *T*-1 private investigators .
While <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">tape recordings 0 *T*-1 to uncover , say , infidelity</COREF> are n't admissible in court , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can mean leverage in a settlement .
*PRO*-1 Concerned with the increased availability of <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">surveillance technology</COREF> and heavier use of <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , lawmakers have proposed laws addressing the issue .
Nine states have introduced bills requiring that workers and customers be made *-1 aware of monitoring .
And <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">four states</COREF> -- <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> , Florida , Michigan and Pennsylvania</COREF> -- have adopted rules that all parties involved must consent when phone calls are recorded *-1 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">Two bills in <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF></COREF> hope *PRO*-1 to make such restrictions national .
In May , <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rep. Don Edwards</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">D.</COREF> <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Calif .</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> introduced <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">congressional legislation that *T*-2 would require an audible beeping during any employee monitoring , warning <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> that <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are being heard *-1</COREF> .
-LRB- <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">The legislation</COREF> is similar to <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">a <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">1987</COREF> `` beeper bill '' that *T*-2 was <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">defeated</COREF> *-1 after heavy lobbying by the telemarketing industry</COREF> . -RRB-
Also last spring , <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="133" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rep. Ron Dellums</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="133" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">D.</COREF> , <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Calif.</COREF> -RRB- ,</COREF> introduced <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">a bill requiring universal two - party consent to any tapings in cases that *T*-1 do n't involve law enforcement</COREF> .
In addition , products such as voice - activated tape recorders would have *-1 to include beep tones and labels explaining federal laws on eavesdropping .
The outlook on <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">both federal bills</COREF> is uncertain , *PRO* especially remembering <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">1987</COREF> defeat</COREF> .
<COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">The ACLU</COREF> and worker organizations back tighter laws , but employers and device manufacturers object .
`` <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm sympathetic with workers who *T*-1 feel under the gun , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Richard Barton of <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the Direct Marketing Association of America , which *T*-2 is lobbying strenuously against <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">Edwards</COREF> beeper bill</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` But the only way 0 you can find out how your people are doing *T*-2 *T*-1 is by *PRO* listening . ''
<COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">The powerful group , which *T*-1 represents many of the nation 's telemarketers ,</COREF> was instrumental in *PRO* derailing <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">1987</COREF> bill</COREF> .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">Spiegel</COREF> also opposes <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the beeper bill</COREF> , *PRO*-2 saying 0 the noise 0 <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> requires *T*-1 would interfere with customer orders , *PRO* causing irritation and even errors .
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="144" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Laura Dale</COREF> , <COREF ID="144" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">center manager at <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the catalog company 's</COREF> customer order center in Reno , Nev.</COREF> ,</COREF> defends monitoring .
`` <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> like *PRO*-2 to follow up and make sure 0 operators are achieving <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> standards of company service , '' says *T*-3 <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Dale , who *T*-1 supervises 350 operators</COREF> .
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Bonomo</COREF> , <COREF ID="146" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Nynex</COREF> spokesman</COREF> , says 0 <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the telephone company</COREF> needs *-1 to monitor operators *PRO*-1 to evaluate performance during the first six months on the job .
`` Sometimes , '' he says *?* , `` <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll pull someone off the phones for more training . ''
Federal wiretap statutes recognize the right *ICH*-1 of employers *PRO* to monitor employees ' for evaluation purposes .
And in the past , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> has viewed monitoring as an issue best handled in union negotiations .
But opponents , *PRO*-2 led * by <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the CWA</COREF> , say 0 new laws are needed *-1 because monitoring is heavily concentrated in service industries and 81 % of monitored workers are n't represented *-3 by unions .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">The CWA</COREF> claims that monitoring not only infringes on employee privacy , but increases stress .
`` <COREF ID="147" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Nine to Five</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="147" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Cleveland - based office workers organization that *T*-1 supports <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the beeper bill</COREF></COREF> , six months ago started a privacy hot line 0 *T*-2 to receive reports of alleged monitoring abuses .
Meanwhile , supporters of <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Dellums</COREF> two - party consent bill</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is needed *-1 because of a giant loophole in <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the one - party consent law</COREF> .
Currently , if the person taping is a party to the conversation , it *EXP*-1 's all right *PRO* to record without the knowledge of the other person on the line .
-LRB- *PRO* Intercepting other people 's private conversations is illegal and punishable by five years in prison and fines of $ 10,000 *U* . -RRB-
The electronics industry is closely following <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Dellums</COREF> bill</COREF> .
Some marketers of surveillance gear -- including <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Communication Control System Ltd.</COREF> , which *T*-2 owns <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the Counter Spy Shop</COREF> and others like <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> -- already put warning labels *ICH*-1 in <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> catalogs informing customers of <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the one - party law</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">vendors</COREF> contend that <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ca n't control how <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> products are used *-2 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Radio Shack</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has a policy against *PRO* selling <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">products</COREF> if a salesperson suspects 0 <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will be used *-1 illegally .
`` Everything sold at <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Radio Shack</COREF> has a legal purpose , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="149" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Bernard Appel</COREF> , <COREF ID="149" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president of <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the Tandy Corp. subsidiary</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has n't yet studied <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Dellums</COREF> bill</COREF> , but that *PRO* requiring a beeping tone on recorders `` would be ludicrous . ''
Still , <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">Radio Shack</COREF> is aware that some of <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> products are controversial .
A few years ago , <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> voluntarily stopped selling <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">`` <COREF ID="150" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The Big Ear</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="150" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a powerful microphone</COREF></COREF> .

`` But <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were getting too many complaints that <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> were using <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to eavesdrop on <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> neighbors . ''
