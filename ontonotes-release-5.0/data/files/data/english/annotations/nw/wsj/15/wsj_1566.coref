THROUGHOUT <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">THE 1980s</COREF> , investors have been looking for creative alternatives to traditional modes of financial planning .
Capital has been democratized *-1 , and people want in .
Too often , however , small investors are left *-1 with the same stale solutions that *T*-2 appealed to previous generations of fiduciary strategists .
Now <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">a startling new approach</COREF> *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> available to *PRO* building <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> financial portfolio without undue risk , without extensive planning and without *PRO* hurting <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> life style one bit !
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is particularly good news for <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-2 hate risk , who *T*-3 are incapable of *PRO* doing extensive amounts of planning and who *T*-4 refuse *PRO*-5 to see their life styles hurt *-6 in any way</COREF> .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> know who <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> revolutionary system</COREF> is also useful for those who *T*-1 have tried customary forms of *PRO* growing their currency cushion .
Like all Americans seeking chronic prosperity , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do find it *EXP*-2 necessary *PRO* to plunge certain funds into conservative monetary tools , if only *PRO*-3 to assuage <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> father - in - law , who *T*-1 believes in such things .
So throughout <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the decade</COREF> <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have maintained <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> share of individual retirement accounts and CDs , and tinkered with stocks , bonds and mutual funds , as well as *PRO*-1 preserving <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> necessary position in the residential real - estate market .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Return on this fine portfolio</COREF> has been modest when <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has not been negative *T*-1 .
Figure 1 demonstrates the performance of those businesses 0 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've invested in *T*-1 during <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">this prosperous decade</COREF> -LRB- *PRO* see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Oct. 20 , 1989 -RRB- .
Oil - related properties suffered a huge decline until <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> divested <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">myself</COREF> of all such stocks in 1985 , at which point the industry , while *PRO*-1 not lighting up any Christmas trees , began a slow recovery *T*-2 .
Likewise , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">mutual funds</COREF> remained relatively flat until <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> made what *T*-1 was , for <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , a serious investment .
By 1987 , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">these properties</COREF> were in <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">a tailspin</COREF> , *PRO* causing <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> broker at Pru - Bache</COREF> to remark that <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> 'd `` never seen anything like <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> . ''
*PRO*-1 Concerned for <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> state of mind , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> dropped <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> -- and <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> instantly began <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> steady climb back to health .
Perhaps most dramatic was *T*-2 the performance of the metropolitan <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> real - estate market , which *T*-1 was booming until <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> entered it in late 1988 , at which time it posted the first negative compound annual growth rate in years *T*-3 .
*PRO*-2 Disgusted , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> cast around for a different way 0 *PRO* to plan <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> asset distribution *T*-3 , and with hardly any heavy breathing the answer *ICH*-4 struck <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> : <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was doing it already !
We 've all got <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">money 0 *PRO* to spend *T*-1 , some of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> clearly disposable since we keep disposing of it</COREF> .
*PRO* Bank <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ?
Not really !
*PRO* Sock <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> away in long - term instruments ?
Nonsense !
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Daily living</COREF> is the best possible investment !
Your priorities may be different , but here in Figure 2 is *T*-1 where <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've chosen *PRO*-2 to build for the future *T*-3 : <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">personal space ; automotive pursuits ; children 's toys ; gardening equipment , bulbs and shrubs ; and finally , entertainment , perhaps the best investment of all</COREF> .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">All</COREF> have paid off for <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> in double - digit annual growth and continue *-1 to provide significant potential .
At least , according to <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> calculations .
Personal space -LRB- Figure 3 -RRB- has <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">grown</COREF> 35 % annually over the course of <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the decade</COREF> , <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">a performance that *T*-1 would compare positively with an investment in , say , synthetic - leather products for the interiors of cold - weather vehicles , which <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> cousin got into *T*-2 and sort of regrets *T*-2 to this day</COREF> .
The assortment of expensive children 's toys that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have purchased *T*-2 wisely at a host of discount - toy brokerage firms -LRB- Figure 4 -RRB- has increased handsomely in total asset value far beyond any personal investment except , perhaps , for <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> record collection , whose worth , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-3 's safe *PRO* to say *?* , *T*-1 is incalculable .
Continued investment in <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> 1984 subcompact</COREF> has been part of <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> strategy</COREF> -LRB- Figure 5 -RRB- , with present annual contributions now equaling more than 60 % of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the car 's</COREF> original value .
According to <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> calculations , these outlays should have brought the value of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> sedan</COREF> *ICH*-1 to more than $ 22,000 *U* on the open market -LRB- Figure 6 -RRB- , where <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> plan *PRO*-2 to offer <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> shortly *T*-3 .
Expansion of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> living space</COREF> has produced an obvious need for maintenance and construction of suitable lawns , shrubs and bushes fitting to <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> suburban locale .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have thus committed sufficient personal outlay *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">ensure</COREF> that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> grounds and lodgings will never be short of greens and flowers .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> initial stake in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">this blooming enterprise</COREF> has grown tenfold , according to <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> conservative calculations .
At the same time , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> share in a wide variety of entertainment pursuits has given perhaps the most dramatic demonstration of the benefits of creative personal financial planning .
Over the course of <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the decade</COREF> , for instance , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> return on investment in the area of poker alone -LRB- Figures 7A and 7B -RRB- has been most impressive , *PRO*-2 showing bodacious annual expansion with -- given the way 0 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> associates play *T*-1 -- no sign of abatement into the 1990s and beyond *ICH*-3 .
With <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">this personal strategy firmly in place</COREF> , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> look forward to years of fine life - style investments and increasing widespread leverage .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> kids '</COREF> college education looms as <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">perhaps the greatest future opportunity for spending</COREF> , although <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'll probably have *-1 to cash in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> toy portfolio *PRO*-1 to take advantage of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
But with every step 0 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> take *T*-1 , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm building wealth .
You can *?* , too , if you , like <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , refuse *PRO*-1 to bite the bullet .
So *PRO* go out there and eat that debt .
You 're right there in the mainstream of American business , *PRO*-1 building value on the back of insupportable expenditures .
Henry Kravis , *PRO* watch out !
