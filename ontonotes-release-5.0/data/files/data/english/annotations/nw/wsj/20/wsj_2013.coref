When <COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="342" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Maj.

<COREF ID="343" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were the signature of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="344" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> adversary</COREF> , <COREF ID="344" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Panamanian leader Manuel Antonio Noriega</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="341" TYPE="IDENT">The rebel officer 's</COREF> slow and painful death , at the headquarters of <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama 's</COREF> Battalion - 2000 squad , was personally supervised *-2001 by <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Gen.

*PRO*-2 Leaping into rages , *PRO*-2 sinking into bouts of drunkenness and mistrust , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> has put to death some 70 of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> troops involved * in <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the coup</COREF> , according to U.S. officials monitoring crematoriums and funeral parlors in <COREF ID="346" TYPE="IDENT">Panama City</COREF> .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is now changing the place 0 <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> sleeps *T*-1 every night , sometimes more than once a night .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> meals are most often prepared by <COREF ID="349" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">women 0 <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> trusts *T*-1</COREF> -- <COREF ID="349" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="347" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> full - time mistress</COREF> , <COREF ID="347" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Vicky Amado</COREF> , and <COREF ID="348" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">her mother</COREF> , <COREF ID="348" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Norma</COREF></COREF> .
And <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is collecting the names of those who *T*-1 telephoned <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the coup - makers</COREF> *PRO*-2 to congratulate <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> during <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> brief time in control of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> headquarters .
More enemies 0 *T*-1 to be dealt with *-2 .
In the two weeks since <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the rebellion , which <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> hesitantly backed *T*-1</COREF> , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> has been at <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> most brutal - and efficient - in *PRO*-2 maintaining power .
Yet , while <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">the failed coup</COREF> is a major U.S. foreign policy embarrassment , <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is merely the latest chapter in <COREF ID="313" TYPE="IDENT">a byzantine relationship between <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> and <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> that *T*-1 stretches back three decades</COREF> .
<COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">America 's</COREF> war on <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">the dictator</COREF> over the past two years , following <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> indictment on drug charges in <COREF ID="418" TYPE="IDENT">February 1988</COREF> , is the legacy of <COREF ID="313" TYPE="IDENT">that relationship</COREF> .
Before <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">American foreign policy</COREF> set out *PRO*-1 to destroy <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega</COREF> , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> helped create <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> out of the crucible of <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama 's</COREF> long history of conspirators and pirates .
For most of the past 30 years , <COREF ID="404" TYPE="IDENT">the marriage</COREF> was one of convenience .
In 1960 , for example , when <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> was both a cadet at <COREF ID="305" TYPE="IDENT">an elite military academy in <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">Peru</COREF></COREF> and a spy - in - training for <COREF ID="410" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was detained *-3 by <COREF ID="355" TYPE="IDENT">Lima</COREF> authorities for *PRO* allegedly raping *RNR*-2 and savagely beating *RNR*-2 <COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT">a prostitute</COREF> , according to a U.S. Embassy cable from that period .
<COREF ID="352" TYPE="IDENT">The woman</COREF> had nearly died .
But <COREF ID="410" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. intelligence</COREF> , rather than *PRO* rein in *RNR*-3 or cut loose *RNR*-3 <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="410" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> new spy</COREF> , merely filed the report away .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> tips on emerging leftists at <COREF ID="305" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> school</COREF> were deemed *-1 more important to U.S. interests .
From that point on , <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> would make a practice of *PRO* overlooking <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">the Panamanian 's</COREF> misadventures .
<COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> has befriended *RNR*-4 and later turned against *RNR*-4 many dictators , but none quite so resourceful .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">The 55 - year - old Mr. Noriega</COREF> is n't as smooth as <COREF ID="299" TYPE="IDENT">the shah of <COREF ID="390" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF></COREF> , as well - born as <COREF ID="411" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="353" TYPE="IDENT">Nicaragua 's</COREF> Anastasio Somoza</COREF> , as imperial as Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines or as bloody as Haiti 's Baby Doc Duvalier .
Yet <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has proved *-1 more resilient than any of them .
And out of necessity : <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> can make mistakes and still hope *PRO*-1 to remove <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> from power , but a single error on <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> part could cost <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life .
`` <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> underestimated <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega</COREF> all along , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="295" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="354" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ambler Moss</COREF> , <COREF ID="354" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a former Ambassador to <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has mastered the art of survival . ''
In *PRO* keeping with <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">America 's</COREF> long history of *PRO* propping up <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> , recent U.S. actions have extended rather than shortened <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> survival .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> might have fallen of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own weight in <COREF ID="419" TYPE="IDENT">1988</COREF> because of <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama 's</COREF> dire economic situation , says 0 *?* <COREF ID="295" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Moss</COREF> , but increasing external pressure has only given <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> additional excuses for repression , and a scapegoat for <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own mismanagement .
`` If <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> had sat back and done nothing , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> might not have made it through <COREF ID="419" TYPE="IDENT">1988</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="295" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Moss</COREF> contends *T*-1 .
Perhaps most important , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> allies have intervened *PRO*-1 to encourage *RNR*-2 -- in some cases , to demand *RNR*-2 -- that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">the dictator</COREF> maintain <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> grip of the throne .
One Colombian drug boss , upon *PRO* hearing in 1987 that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Gen. Noriega</COREF> was negotiating with <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> *PRO*-1 to abandon <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> command for a comfortable exile , sent <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a hand - sized mahogany coffin engraved * with <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> name .
`` <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is cornered , '' says *T*-2 the Rev. Fernando Guardia , who *T*-1 has led Catholic Church opposition against <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega</COREF> .
`` The Americans have left <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> without a way out .
It *EXP*-6 is easy *PRO* to fight when you do n't have any other option *T*-1 . ''
<COREF ID="366" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> chief advantage in the fight</COREF> : <COREF ID="366" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> intimate knowledge of American ways and weaknesses</COREF> .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> often tells friends that patience is the best weapon against the gringos , who *T*-1 have a short attention span and little stomach for lasting confrontation .
<COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> <COREF ID="412" TYPE="IDENT">discovered</COREF> <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">the young Tony Noriega</COREF> in late 1959 , when <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was in <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> second year at <COREF ID="305" TYPE="IDENT">the Chorrillos Military Academy in <COREF ID="355" TYPE="IDENT">Lima</COREF></COREF> *T*-1 , according to former U.S. intelligence officials .
<COREF ID="412" TYPE="IDENT">The contact</COREF> occurred through <COREF ID="278" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="356" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> half - brother</COREF> , <COREF ID="356" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Panamanian diplomat based * in <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">Peru</COREF> named * *PRO*-1 Luis Carlos Noriega Hurtado</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="278" TYPE="IDENT">Luis Carlos</COREF> , *PRO*-2 knowing that *PRO* helping the Americans could advance the career of any Panamanian officer , relayed <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Tony 's</COREF> reports on the leftist tendencies 0 <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> observed *T*-1 among <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fellow students and , more important , among <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> officers and instructors .
A spy was born *-1 .
It was a heady experience for <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">the pockmarked and slightly built Mr. Noriega , who *T*-2 was known *-1 to <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> friends as <COREF ID="358" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Cara la Pina</COREF> -- <COREF ID="358" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">pineapple face</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Born the illegitimate son of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father 's maid , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was raised *-1 on the mean streets of the central market district of <COREF ID="346" TYPE="IDENT">Panama City</COREF> .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Tony</COREF> was four years older than most of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fellow cadets , and gained admission to <COREF ID="305" TYPE="IDENT">the academy</COREF> because <COREF ID="278" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> brother</COREF> had falsified <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> birth certificate .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> considered <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> intellectually superior to <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> Peruvian peers , many of whom *T*-1 were wayward sons sent * by their well - off families to <COREF ID="305" TYPE="IDENT">the highly disciplined , French - modeled academy</COREF> as a sort of reform school .
In <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> peaked military cap and neatly pressed , French - made uniform , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega</COREF> felt more respected and powerful than ever in <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> underprivileged life , friends from the period say 0 *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had an elegant uniform with gold buttons in <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">a country where there was a cult of militarism *T*-2 , where officers were the elite with special privileges *T*-1</COREF> , '' recalls *T*-3 <COREF ID="359" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Darien Ayala</COREF> , <COREF ID="359" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a fellow student in <COREF ID="357" TYPE="IDENT">Peru</COREF> and a lifelong friend</COREF> .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> relationship to American intelligence agencies became contractual in either 1966 or <COREF ID="420" TYPE="IDENT">1967</COREF> , intelligence officials say 0 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="368" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> commanding officer at the <COREF ID="373" TYPE="IDENT">Chiriqui Province</COREF> garrison</COREF> , <COREF ID="368" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Major Omar Torrijos</COREF> , gave <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> an intriguing assignment : <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> would organize <COREF ID="369" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="373" TYPE="IDENT">the province 's</COREF> first intelligence service</COREF> .
<COREF ID="369" TYPE="IDENT">The spy network</COREF> would serve two clients *NOT* : <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">the Panamanian government</COREF> , by *PRO* monitoring political opponents in the region , and <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> , by *PRO* tracking the growing Communist influence in the unions organized * at <COREF ID="370" TYPE="IDENT">United Fruit Co. 's</COREF> banana plantations in Bocas del Toros and Puerto Armuelles .
<COREF ID="370" TYPE="IDENT">United Fruit</COREF> was one of the two largest contributors to <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama 's</COREF> national income .
*PRO* Satisfying <COREF ID="370" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> interests was a priority for any Panamanian leader .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> initial retainer was only $ 50 *U* to $ 100 *U* a month , plus occasional gifts of liquor or groceries from the American PX , a former intelligence official says 0 *T*-1 .
It was modest pay by American standards , but a healthy boost to <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> small military salary , which fellow officers remember *T*-1 as *PRO*-2 having been $ 300 *U* to $ 400 *U* monthly .
`` <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> very well , '' recalls *T*-2 <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="371" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Boris Martinez</COREF> , <COREF ID="371" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a former Panamanian colonel who *T*-1 managed <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> operation</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> started building the files that *T*-1 helped <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 gain power . ''
A National Guard job assumed * by <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Capt. Noriega</COREF> in 1964 -- as chief of the transit police in <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="372" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">David City</COREF> , <COREF ID="372" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">capital of <COREF ID="373" TYPE="IDENT">the Chiriqui Province</COREF></COREF></COREF> -- was tailor - made for an aspiring super-spy .
By *PRO*-2 pressuring taxi and bus drivers who *T*-1 needed licenses , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gained a ready cache of information .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> knew which local luminaries *T*-4 had been caught *-1 *PRO*-5 driving drunk , which *T*-3 had been found *-2 with their mistresses .
This proved *-3 particularly valuable to <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">the Panamanian government</COREF> in <COREF ID="420" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="420" TYPE="IDENT">1967</COREF> , when union leaders were planning a May Day march that <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> feared 0 *T*-1 could turn violent *T*-2</COREF> .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> had learned that <COREF ID="375" TYPE="IDENT">a local union leader</COREF> was sleeping with the wife of <COREF ID="375" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> deputy .
So <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> splashed the information on handbills that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> distributed *T*-3 throughout the banana - exporting city of Puerto Armuelles , which *T*-2 was ruled *-1 by <COREF ID="370" TYPE="IDENT">United Fruit Co</COREF> .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The campaign</COREF> so divided <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">union leaders</COREF> that <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> found <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> far easier 0 *PRO* to control *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was like a play on Broadway , '' recalls *T*-1 <COREF ID="240" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Martinez</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega</COREF> managed the whole thing .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was superb .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega</COREF> was an expert at *PRO* bribing and blackmailing people . ''
During <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> years in <COREF ID="373" TYPE="IDENT">Chiriqui</COREF> , however , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> also revealed <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> as an officer as perverse as <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was ingenious .
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="376" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rodrigo Miranda</COREF> , <COREF ID="376" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a local lawyer and human - rights monitor</COREF> ,</COREF> recalls <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">an intoxicated Noriega visiting <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">prisoners</COREF> in <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cells at the 5th Zone Garrison headquarters in <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">David , where he had his offices *T*-1</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> would order <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> all</COREF> *PRO*-1 to take off <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> clothes and run around the courtyard naked , *PRO* laughing at <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and then retreating to <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> office .
`` People started wondering if something was wrong with <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Miranda</COREF> recalls *T*-1 .
But through this period , so far as the U.S. military was concerned *-1 , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> was a model recruit .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> signed up for intelligence and counter-intelligence training under American officers at Fort Gulick in <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> in July <COREF ID="420" TYPE="IDENT">1967</COREF> , according to a copy of a 1983 resume with details 0 <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> has since classified *T*-1 as secret .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> flew to Fort Bragg , N.C. , in September of <COREF ID="420" TYPE="IDENT">that year</COREF> for a course in psychological operations , *PRO* returning to the School of the Americas in <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> for a two - month course called * *PRO*-1 `` military intelligence for officers . ''
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Some American officers</COREF> interpreted <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> eagerness and studiousness as a sign of loyalty , but <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did so falsely .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> rose to chief of intelligence in <COREF ID="381" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama 's</COREF> socalled G - 2</COREF> in 1970 after *PRO* providing <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">populist dictator Torrijos</COREF> the critical support *PRO* to defeat a coup attempt against <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a year earlier .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> became <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">Gen. Torrijos 's</COREF> inseparable shadow , and the holder of all Panama 's secrets .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="378" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Noriega</COREF> , by now <COREF ID="378" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a lieutenant colonel</COREF> ,</COREF> expanded <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> contacts *PRO*-2 to include <COREF ID="380" TYPE="IDENT">the Cubans</COREF> -- not to mention the Israelis , the Taiwanese and any other intelligence service that *T*-1 came knocking .
When U.S. diplomats complained to <COREF ID="397" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Col. Noriega 's</COREF> moonlighting *T*-1 , intelligence experts always insisted that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> allegiance was first to the Americans .
`` Early on in <COREF ID="379" TYPE="IDENT">the State Department</COREF> , <COREF ID="379" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> took to *PRO* calling <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-4 the *PRO* rent - a - colonel , in tribute to <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> ability *PRO* to simultaneously milk the antagonistic intelligence services of Cuba and <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> , '' recalls *T*-1 Francis J. McNeil , who , as deputy assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs , *T*-2 first ran across reports about <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> in 1977 *T*-3 .
`` Some of <COREF ID="379" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> wondered how <COREF ID="379" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> intelligence people could put so much stock in <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> information when <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was just as close to <COREF ID="380" TYPE="IDENT">the Cubans</COREF> *T*-1 *T*-2 . ''
Even at this early stage , drugs caused additional concerns .
During the Nixon administration , <COREF ID="382" TYPE="IDENT">the Drug Enforcement Administration</COREF> became dismayed at the extent of <COREF ID="381" TYPE="IDENT">the G - 2 's</COREF> connections to arrested drug traffickers .
One <COREF ID="382" TYPE="IDENT">DEA</COREF> agent drew up a list of five options for *PRO* dealing with <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Col. Noriega</COREF> , one of which *T*-1 was assassination .

But <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did fly to <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> *PRO*-1 to scold <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">dictator Torrijos</COREF> on the drug ties of Panamanian officials , including <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> .
<COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ingersoll</COREF> later recalled that <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">Gen. Torrijos</COREF> seemed *-1 afraid *PRO* to act on the concerns of <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> .
`` Everybody was afraid of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Ingersoll</COREF> says *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> became an even greater threat in 1976 , when U.S. intelligence services discovered that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had been buying <COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">recordings of electronically monitored conversations</COREF> from three sergeants working for the U.S. Army 's 470th Military Intelligence Group *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="182" TYPE="IDENT">The tapes</COREF> included wiretaps of <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">Gen. Torrijos 's</COREF> own phone , according to American intelligence officials .
`` We caught <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> with <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hands on our cookie jar , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="384" TYPE="IDENT">former <COREF ID="397" TYPE="IDENT">CIA</COREF> Director Stansfield Turner</COREF> .
For the first time , <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> considered cutting <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> from <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> intelligence payroll -- and the deliberations were intense , <COREF ID="384" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Turner</COREF> says 0 *T*-1 .
`` In the world of intelligence , if you want *PRO*-1 to get <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">information</COREF> , you get <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> from seedy characters .
The question is how much you get tied *-2 in with <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">seedy characters</COREF> so <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can extort you *T*-1 . ''
Intelligence officials to this day worry whether <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> sold sensitive information on the recordings to <COREF ID="380" TYPE="IDENT">the Cubans</COREF> or others .
<COREF ID="384" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Turner</COREF> was troubled *-1 enough *PRO* to cancel the U.S. contract with <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">the *PRO* rent - a - colonel</COREF> at the beginning of the Carter administration .
<COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> soon found <COREF ID="385" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">new cause for concern</COREF> : <COREF ID="385" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">gun - running</COREF> .
Prosecutors in Southern Florida <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">indicted</COREF> <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">five Panamanians</COREF> on charges of *PRO* illegally running arms to Sandinista rebels trying *PRO* to overthrow the Nicaraguan government of <COREF ID="411" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Somoza</COREF> .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> included <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">one of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> closest friends and business partners , Carlos Wittgreen</COREF> .
And the investigators were quickly closing in on <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega himself</COREF> .
At the time , though , in 1979 , <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> was once again flirting with <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> longtime Latin American spy</COREF> .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> made plans *PRO* to fly to <COREF ID="406" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> for a meeting with <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> counterpart at <COREF ID="387" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon</COREF> .
Dade County and federal authorities , *PRO*-1 learning that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> intended *PRO*-2 to fly through <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">Miami</COREF> , made <COREF ID="388" TYPE="IDENT">plans *PRO* to arrest <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> on the gun - running charges as soon as <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> hit U.S. soil</COREF> .
It was a Friday in June .
<COREF ID="387" TYPE="IDENT">The Pentagon</COREF> foiled <COREF ID="388" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> .
According to military officers at the time , word *ICH*-1 was passed *-2 to <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> by <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> American hosts that the police would be waiting .
On Monday , U.S. officials received <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">a routine , unclassified message</COREF> from the military group commander in <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> .
`` Due to health reasons , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Lt. Col. Noriega</COREF> has elected *PRO*-1 to postpone <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> visit to <COREF ID="406" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> read *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Prosecutors in <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">Miami</COREF></COREF> received yet another setback .
<COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> original indictment against <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="389" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Wittgreen</COREF> , <COREF ID="389" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the friend of <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF></COREF></COREF> , and the other four</COREF></COREF> was dismissed *-1 on a technicality .
But now , along with *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="414" TYPE="IDENT">reindicting</COREF> <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> pal</COREF> , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> intended *PRO*-2 to charge <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega himself</COREF> , on allegations that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was involved *-1 in the illegal trading of some $ 2 million *U* in arms .
In January 1980 , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Jerome Sanford</COREF> , as assistant U.S. attorney , was summoned *-1 to a meeting with a Federal Bureau of Investigation agent assigned * to the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms in <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">Miami</COREF> .
<COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT">Panamanian dictator Torrijos</COREF> , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was told *-1 0 *?* , had granted <COREF ID="299" TYPE="IDENT">the shah of <COREF ID="390" TYPE="IDENT">Iran</COREF></COREF> asylum in <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> as a favor to <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> .
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Sanford</COREF> was told *-1 0 <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="391" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> friend</COREF> , <COREF ID="391" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Wittgreen</COREF> ,</COREF> would be handling <COREF ID="299" TYPE="IDENT">the shah 's</COREF> security .
It *EXP*-1 would n't be a good idea *PRO* to <COREF ID="414" TYPE="IDENT">indict</COREF> <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *NOT* -- much less <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the prosecutor</COREF> was told *-2 0 *T*-3 .
After prodding from <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Sanford</COREF> , <COREF ID="392" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. Attorney Jack Eskenazi</COREF> pleaded with <COREF ID="395" TYPE="IDENT">Justice Department</COREF> officials in <COREF ID="406" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> *PRO* to let <COREF ID="414" TYPE="IDENT">the indictment</COREF> proceed .
`` Unfortunately , '' <COREF ID="392" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Eskenazi</COREF> wrote 0 *?* in <COREF ID="394" TYPE="IDENT">a letter</COREF> , `` those of us in law enforcement in <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">Miami</COREF> find ourselves frequently attempting *PRO*-2 to enforce the laws of <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> but simultaneously being caught *-2 between foreign policy considerations over which we have no control *T*-1 . ''
<COREF ID="394" TYPE="IDENT">The letter</COREF> , along with a detailed prosecution memo , sat on the desks of <COREF ID="395" TYPE="IDENT">Justice</COREF> officials for months before the case died a quiet death .
`` <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 if we had been allowed *-3 to go ahead then we would n't have the problems 0 we have *T*-1 now , '' <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Sanford</COREF> says *T*-2 .
`` If <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had been found *-1 guilty , we could have stopped <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> . ''
In August 1983 , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> took over as General *RNR*-2 and de-facto dictator *RNR*-2 of <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> , *PRO* having maneuvered <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> way to the top only two years after the mysterious death in a plane crash of <COREF ID="377" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> old boss Omar Torrijos</COREF> .
Soon , the military became a veritable mafia controlling legal and illegal businesses .
<COREF ID="396" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="415" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration</COREF> also put <COREF ID="381" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> G - 2</COREF> back on the U.S. payroll .
Payments *ICH*-3 averaged nearly $ 200,000 *U* a year from <COREF ID="410" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency</COREF> and <COREF ID="397" TYPE="IDENT">the CIA</COREF> .
Although *PRO*-1 working for U.S. intelligence , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> was hardly helping <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> exclusively .
During the <COREF ID="415" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> years <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> expanded <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> business and intelligence contacts with <COREF ID="380" TYPE="IDENT">the Cubans</COREF> and the Sandinistas .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> allegedly entered into <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama 's</COREF> first formal business arrangement with Colombian drug bosses , according to <COREF ID="398" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Floyd Carlton</COREF> , <COREF ID="398" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a pilot who *T*-1 once worked for <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> and who *T*-2 testified before the U.S. grand jury in <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">Miami</COREF> that *T*-3 would ultimately indict <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">the Panamanian</COREF> on drug charges</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> was convinced *-5 0 the <COREF ID="415" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> White House would n't act against <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , recalls 0 *?* <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> close ally Jose Blandon</COREF> , because <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="399" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an insurance policy</COREF> : <COREF ID="399" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> involvement with <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the Contra rebels in <COREF ID="353" TYPE="IDENT">Nicaragua</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Blandon</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">the general</COREF> allowed <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the Contras</COREF> to set up a secret training center in <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> also conveyed intelligence from <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> spy operation inside the Nicaraguan capital of Managua .
And on at least one occasion , in the spring of <COREF ID="422" TYPE="IDENT">1985</COREF> , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> helped arrange a sabotage attack on a Sandinista arsenal in <COREF ID="353" TYPE="IDENT">Nicaragua</COREF> .
Although , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> help for the <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Contra</COREF> cause</COREF> was limited *-1 , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was enough *PRO* to win <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> important protectors in <COREF ID="396" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="415" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration</COREF> , says 0 *T*-3 <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="360" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sen. Patrick Leahy</COREF> , <COREF ID="360" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Vermont Democrat who *T*-2 then served on the Senate Intelligence Committee</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega</COREF> played U.S. intelligence agencies and <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. government</COREF> like a violin , '' <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
An incident in <COREF ID="421" TYPE="IDENT">1984</COREF> suggested one additional means by which <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> might have maintained such influence with <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> *T*-1 -- by *PRO* compromising U.S. officials .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="362" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Curtin Windsor</COREF> , then <COREF ID="362" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the ambassador to Costa Rica</COREF> ,</COREF> recalls *PRO*-2 being <COREF ID="363" TYPE="IDENT">invited</COREF> *-1 to <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> by <COREF ID="278" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> brother Luis Carlos</COREF> for a weekend of deep sea fishing and `` quiet , serious conversation '' on the Aswara Peninsula .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Windsor</COREF> notified <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="361" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Everett E. Briggs</COREF> , <COREF ID="361" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the U.S. ambassador to <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> of <COREF ID="363" TYPE="IDENT">the invitation</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Briggs</COREF> screamed , '' <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Windsor</COREF> recalls *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Briggs</COREF> told <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was being set up *-1 for a `` honey trap , '' in which <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> would try *PRO*-2 to involve <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in <COREF ID="416" TYPE="IDENT">an orgy</COREF> and then record <COREF ID="416" TYPE="IDENT">the event</COREF> `` with sound and video *T*-3 . ''
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Briggs , on vacation after *PRO* resigning his position at the National Security Council ,</COREF> could n't be reached *-1 for comment .
As <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> political troubles grew , so did <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> offers of assistance to <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the Contras</COREF> , an apparent attempt *PRO* to curry more favor in <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">Washington</COREF> .
For instance , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> helped <COREF ID="409" TYPE="IDENT">steal</COREF> <COREF ID="400" TYPE="IDENT">the May <COREF ID="421" TYPE="IDENT">1984</COREF> Panamanian elections</COREF> for the ruling party .
But just one month later , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> also contributed $ 100,000 *U* to a <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Contra</COREF> leader , according to documents released * for <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Oliver North 's</COREF> criminal trial in <COREF ID="406" TYPE="IDENT">Washington , D.C</COREF></COREF> .
Yet , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> political setbacks mounted .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> was accused *-1 of *PRO*-1 ordering in <COREF ID="422" TYPE="IDENT">1985</COREF> <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the beheading of <COREF ID="401" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hugo Spadafora</COREF> , <COREF ID="401" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> most outspoken political opponent and the first man 0 *T*-2 to publicly finger <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> on drug trafficking charges</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> then ousted <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="402" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">President Nicholas Ardito Barletta</COREF> , <COREF ID="402" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a former World Bank official with close ties to <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF></COREF></COREF> , after <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Barletta</COREF> tried *PRO*-1 to create a commission *PRO* to investigate <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the murder</COREF> .
And , all the while , <COREF ID="345" TYPE="IDENT">Panama 's</COREF> debt problems continued *-1 to grow .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> was growing desperate .
In late 1986 , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> made <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">an offer 0 <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> could n't refuse *T*-1</COREF> .

''
`` <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">North</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">the document</COREF> went on *T*-2 , *PRO*-1 referring to <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Oliver North</COREF> , `` has told <COREF ID="403" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega 's</COREF> representative</COREF> that U.S. law forbade such actions .
<COREF ID="403" TYPE="IDENT">The representative</COREF> responded that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega</COREF> had numerous assets in place in <COREF ID="353" TYPE="IDENT">Nicaragua</COREF> and could accomplish many essential things , just as <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Noriega</COREF> had helped -LCB- <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> . -RCB- the previous year in *PRO* blowing up a Sandinista arsenal . ''
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Col.

<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> proposal</COREF> was turned *-1 down .
And <COREF ID="417" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Shultz</COREF> curtly told <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Abrams</COREF> that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">the general</COREF> should be told *-1 that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">only he</COREF> could repair <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> tarnished image .
The end of <COREF ID="404" TYPE="IDENT">the marriage</COREF> was at hand .
Within weeks the unfolding <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">Iran - Contra</COREF> scandal took away <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega 's</COREF> insurance policy</COREF> .
The death of <COREF ID="397" TYPE="IDENT">CIA</COREF> Director William Casey and resignation of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Oliver North</COREF> allowed <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">anti-Noriega</COREF> political forces to gain influence .
Public protests against <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> were triggered *-1 in June 1987 due to charges *ICH*-2 by <COREF ID="365" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Diaz Herrera</COREF> , <COREF ID="365" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> former chief of staff</COREF> , that <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> had <COREF ID="409" TYPE="IDENT">stolen</COREF> <COREF ID="400" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="421" TYPE="IDENT">1984</COREF> election</COREF> and had ordered the killing of Messrs. Spadafora and Torrijos .
Few American officials were willing any longer *PRO*-1 to defend <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
Lawyers in <COREF ID="364" TYPE="IDENT">Miami</COREF> -- *PRO*-1 this time working virtually without impediment -- prepared *PRO*-1 to have <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> indicted *-2 on drug charges in <COREF ID="418" TYPE="IDENT">February 1988</COREF> .
During negotiations with American officials in May 1988 over proposals *PRO* to drop the U.S. indictments in exchange for <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> resignation , <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> often asked almost plaintively how the Americans , whom <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had helped *T*-1 for so many years , could turn against <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-2 .
Now , neither side -- <COREF ID="350" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> nor <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> -- has an easy out .
President Bush has sworn *PRO*-1 to bring <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to justice .
<COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> believes 0 <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has n't any alternative but *PRO* to continue clutching to power .
It is a knock - out battle -- perhaps to the death .
In the end , is <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> the political equivalent of Frankenstein 's monster , created * by a well - intentioned but misguided foreign power ?
Not quite , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Leahy</COREF> contends 0 *T*-1 .
`` For short - term gains , people were willing *PRO* to put up with <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
That allowed <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to get stronger and stronger , '' <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 we created <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> as much as we fed <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , nurtured <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and let <COREF ID="337" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> grow up *PRO* to be big and strong .
