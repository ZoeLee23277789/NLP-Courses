<COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">The House</COREF> <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">approved</COREF> <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">a short - term spending bill 0 *T*-1 to keep <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> *PRO*-2 operating through Nov. 15 and provide <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">$ 2.85 billion *U* in emergency funds</COREF> *PRO* to assist in the recovery from <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Hurricane Hugo</COREF> and <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> earthquake</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">The 321 - 99 roll call vote</COREF> reflected broad support for <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the disaster assistance</COREF> , but the cost to the Treasury is sure *-1 to aggravate budget pressures this year and next under <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the Gramm - Rudman deficit reduction law</COREF> .
By a lopsided 401 - 18 margin , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the chamber</COREF> rejected an effort *PRO* to waive <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Gramm - Rudman</COREF> for purposes of *PRO* addressing <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the two disasters</COREF> , and budget analysts estimate 0 <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">the increased appropriations</COREF> will widen the <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">fiscal 1990</COREF> deficit by at least $ 1.44 billion *U* unless offsetting spending cuts or new revenues are found *-19 by <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">The budget impact</COREF> will be greater still in <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">fiscal 1991</COREF> , and <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> forced a confrontation between the <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Appropriations Committee</COREF> leadership and <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta , whose <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> district *T*-1 was at the center of <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the earthquake last week</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO*-1 Going to the well of <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the chamber</COREF> , <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Panetta</COREF> demanded 0 <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the costs</COREF> be fully counted *-2 .
<COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> prominent role put <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in the awkward position of *PRO* challenging the very committee members on whom <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> state</COREF> will be most dependent *T*-1 in the months ahead .
`` We do not come to <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">this House</COREF> *PRO*-1 asking for any handout , '' said *T*-2 <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> Democrat</COREF> .
`` We do not intend *PRO*-1 to hide <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">these costs</COREF> from the American people . ''
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">The $ 2.85 billion *U* package</COREF> incorporates <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">$ 500 million *U* for low - interest disaster loans</COREF> , $ 1 billion *U* in highway construction funds , and $ 1.35 billion *U* divided * between general emergency assistance and a reserve 0 *T*-1 to be available to President Bush *PRO*-2 to meet unanticipated costs from <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the two disasters</COREF> .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">The funds</COREF> are in addition to $ 1.1 billion *U* appropriated * last month *PRO* to assist in the recovery from <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Hugo</COREF> , *PRO* bringing the total for <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the two disasters</COREF> to nearly $ 4 billion *U* in unanticipated spending .
Because of the vagaries of <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Gramm - Rudman</COREF> , the immediate impact is relatively small .
But the appropriations set in motion spending that *T*-1 adds to an already grim budget picture for <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">fiscal 1991</COREF> .
Within <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations process</COREF> , the situation is even more difficult since the costs will be counted *-1 against the share of funds 0 *T*-4 to be allocated *-2 to those subcommittees that *T*-3 recently have had the greatest difficulty in *PRO* staying within the budget .
The underlying bill approved * <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> is required *-2 *PRO* to keep <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> *PRO*-3 operating past midnight <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">tonight</COREF> , and this urgency has contributed to the speed -- and , critics say 0 *?* , mistakes -- that *T*-1 have accompanied the package of disaster assistance .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">The hastily drafted measure</COREF> could hurt <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">California</COREF> by *PRO*-2 requiring <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-3 to put up more matching funds for emergency highway assistance than *PRO* otherwise would be required *-1 .
And <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> delegation</COREF> is fearful that the new funding will be counted *-1 against a separate $ 185 million *U* in federal highway funds 0 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would expect *PRO*-3 to receive *T*-2 under <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> normal allocation this year .
Also , the high price of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">San Francisco</COREF> real estate puts <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> at odds with federal regulations more attuned to the national average .
For example , disaster loans , which *T*-1 will go to small businesses and homeowners , offer credit as low as 4 % in some cases .
But <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">San Francisco</COREF> delegation</COREF> finds <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> asking that the cap per household be lifted *-1 to $ 500,000 *U* from $ 100,000 *U* *PRO* to assist the hard hit but often wealthy Marina district .
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">The Senate</COREF> is expected *-1 to make <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">some modifications</COREF> today , but both the White House and <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> appear *-2 most anxious *PRO*-3 to speed final approval before <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">tonight 's</COREF> deadline .
Administration pressure discourages any effort *PRO* to add to total funding , and <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> changes</COREF> are expected *-1 to be largely technical -- *PRO*-3 dealing with highway aid and lifting the ceiling on total Small Business Administration loans to $ 1.8 billion *U* *PRO*-2 to accommodate the increased activity expected * .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Yesterday 's</COREF> floor action came as <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">a <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> - <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> conference</COREF> approved a nearly $ 8.5 billion *U* fiscal 1990 military construction bill , representing a 5 % reduction from last year and making severe cuts from Pentagon requests for installations abroad .
An estimated $ 25.8 million *U* is allocated *-1 *PRO* to continue work in Oman .
But all funding *ICH*-3 is cut *-1 for the Philippines , and projects in South Korea are cut *-2 to $ 13.6 million *U* , or less than a sixth of the administration 's request .
Closer to home , <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the negotiators</COREF> were more generous .
An estimated $ 38.9 million *U* was set *-1 aside for military installations in the home state of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">North Carolina Rep. W.G. Hefner</COREF> , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> chairman</COREF></COREF> .
And $ 70.2 million *U* would go to projects in Tennessee represented * by <COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> Senate counterpart and fellow Democrat</COREF> , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sen. James Sasser</COREF> .
Texas and California are traditionally powerful within <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the conference</COREF> , but equally striking is *T*-1 the dominance of <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">Alaska , Pennsylvania and <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">West Virginia</COREF></COREF> because of <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> power elsewhere in <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the appropriations process</COREF> .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">Senate Appropriations Committee</COREF> Chairman Robert Byrd -LRB- D. , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">W.Va .</COREF> -RRB-</COREF> even added report language listing $ 49.4 million *U* in projects 0 <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wants *T*-1 in the budget next year .
No individual illustrated this mix of power more *ICH*-2 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> than <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Daniel Inouye -LRB- D. , <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Hawaii</COREF> -RRB- , who *T*-1 chairs the <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> defense subcommittee</COREF> .
In the final trading , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF> was insistent on *PRO* setting aside $ 500 million *U* *PRO* to carry out base closings ordered * *PRO*-1 to begin in <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">fiscal 1990</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> gave ground to <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Inouye</COREF> on a number of projects , ranging from a $ 11 million *U* parking garage here , to a land transfer in <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Hawaii</COREF> , to a provision *PRO* to assist <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the Makwah Indian Tribe in Washington state</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The tribe</COREF> is one of the poorest in the Pacific Northwest .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Inouye , who *T*-1 chairs the select committee on Indian Affairs ,</COREF> used <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> power *PRO*-2 to move $ 400,000 *U* from the Air Force to the Bureau of Indian Affairs *PRO* to assist in *PRO* renovating a decommissoned base *PRO* to accommodate a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center .
Meanwhile , <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> - <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> negotiators</COREF> have tentatively agreed on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">a $ 3.18 billion *U* anti-drug and anti-crime intitiative</COREF> , *PRO*-2 cutting other federal spending 0.43 % *PRO*-1 to pay for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
A formal <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">House</COREF> - <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> conference is expected *-1 to ratify <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the accord</COREF> later this week .
