Sales of North American - built cars and trucks plunged 20.5 % in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">mid-October</COREF> from a year earlier , as domestic manufacturers paid the price for heavy incentives earlier this year .
`` People are <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">waiting</COREF> for -LCB- new -RCB- factory giveaways , '' said *T*-2 <COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ben Kaye</COREF> , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">sales manager of Bob Brest Auto World in Lynn , Mass. , whose sales *T*-1 are slow</COREF> .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">This trend</COREF> appears *-2 to be especially true at <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">General Motors Corp. , which *T*-1 used both dealer and consumer incentives *PRO*-3 to ignite sales in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">August and September</COREF></COREF> .

Sales of domestically made trucks also continued *-1 to be sluggish in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">mid-October</COREF> , *PRO*-1 dropping 22.8 % to 94,543 from a year ago .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The Big Three auto makers</COREF> already have <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">slashed</COREF> fourth - quarter production plans 10.4 % below year - ago levels , but <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> may not be enough *PRO* to prevent inventories from ballooning if sales do n't improve .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Industry analyst John H. Qualls</COREF> , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a vice president with Hill -AMP- Knowlton in St. Louis</COREF> , forecasts that domestic auto makers will have a 93 - day supply of cars at the end of <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF> , even if car sales improve to a 6.5 million vehicle rate for the quarter .

The earlier use of incentives depleted the market of `` scavengers '' for bargain - basement <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">1989</COREF> cars , he said 0 *T*-1 .
Town -AMP- Country Ford in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Charlotte , N.C. ,</COREF> still needs *-1 to move about 850 <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">1989</COREF> cars and trucks .
Business had been fairly strong until Hurricane Hugo hit <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the area</COREF> , but has been down since .

A <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Nissan</COREF> spokesman attributed <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the increase</COREF> to the use of incentives <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> and not a year ago and to higher fleet sales .
