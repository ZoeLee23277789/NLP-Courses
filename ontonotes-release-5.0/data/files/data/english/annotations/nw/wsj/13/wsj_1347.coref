<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon Corp.</COREF> <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">filed</COREF> suit against <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the state of <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Alaska</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-1 charging 0 state officials interfered with <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the oil company 's</COREF> initial efforts *PRO* to treat <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">last spring 's giant oil spill</COREF> .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">The action</COREF> is a counterclaim to <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">a suit filed * by <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Alaska</COREF> in August against <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon</COREF> and six other oil companies</COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The state 's</COREF> suit</COREF> alleges that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon 's</COREF> response to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the spill</COREF> failed *-1 to prevent contamination of hundreds of miles of shoreline along Prince William Sound .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">That suit</COREF> and <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon 's</COREF> countersuit</COREF> were filed *-1 in a state court in Anchorage .
Neither suit lists specific dollar claims , largely because damage assessment has n't yet been completed *-1 .
Legal strategists say that damage claims against <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the oil giant</COREF> and others could well exceed $ 1 billion *U* .
Litigation , if *PRO*-1 not settled *-2 out of court , could drag on for years .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon</COREF> said in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> suit</COREF> that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will seek reimbursement from <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> for that part of the cleanup costs and damage claims 0 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> says 0 *T*-1 resulted from <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> conduct .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">The oil company</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">claims</COREF> that Alaskan officials prevented <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon</COREF> from *PRO*-1 spraying dispersant onto the almost 11 million gallons of oil dumped * when one of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> tankers ran into an underwater reef *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Craig Tillery</COREF> , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">Alaska</COREF> assistant attorney general</COREF> , said in an interview last night that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon 's</COREF> accusations</COREF> `` are not new .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon</COREF> has made <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> before , at which point <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> demonstrated 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were untrue *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The state</COREF> will vigorously defend against any counterclaim . ''
Since <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the spill last March</COREF> , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon</COREF> and <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> have been wrangling over whether *PRO* spraying dispersant on the oil in the first hours after <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the spill</COREF> , when the weather was clear and calm *T*-2 , would have helped *PRO*-1 limit the environmental damage .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon</COREF> claims that use of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">dispersants</COREF> , which *T*-1 break an oil slick into microscopic droplets ,</COREF> was a crucial part of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> immediate - response plan and that state officials banned <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> use during <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the two days of fair weather following <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the spill</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">The oil company</COREF> claims that <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had permission *ICH*-1 from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the spill</COREF> *PRO* to use dispersant during such an incident at the discretion of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. Coast Guard</COREF> .
<COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">The state 's</COREF> opposition to the use of dispersants , <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon</COREF> says 0 *?* , caused <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Coast Guard</COREF> `` to delay *PRO*-2 granting permission . ''
Alaskan and <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Coast Guard</COREF> officials say 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon 's</COREF> charges</COREF> are n't relevant because tests conducted * during <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the first two days following <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the spill</COREF></COREF> showed that the dispersant was n't working anyway .
Use of dispersants was approved *-1 when a test on the third day showed some positive results *T*-2 , officials said 0 *T*-3 .
