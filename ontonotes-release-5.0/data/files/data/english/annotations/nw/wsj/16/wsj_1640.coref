Electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. companies</COREF> billions and eroding <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> international competitive advantage .
That was the message delivered * by <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">government and private security experts</COREF> at <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">an all - day conference on corporate electronic espionage</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Hostile and even friendly nations</COREF> routinely steal <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">information</COREF> from U.S. companies and share <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own companies , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Noel D. Matchett</COREF> , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a former staffer at the federal National Security Agency</COREF> and now president of Information Security Inc. , Silver Spring , Md</COREF> .
It `` may well be '' that <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">theft</COREF> of business data</COREF> is `` as serious a strategic threat to national security '' as <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a threat to the survival of victimized U.S. firms , said 0 *T*-2 <COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Michelle Van Cleave</COREF> , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the White House 's assistant director for National Security Affairs</COREF> .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The conference</COREF> was jointly sponsored *-1 by the New York Institute of Technology School of Management and <COREF ID="51" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association</COREF> , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a joint industry - government trade group</COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Any secret</COREF> can be <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">pirated</COREF> *-1 , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the experts</COREF> said 0 *?* , if <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is transmitted *-2 over the air .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Even rank amateurs</COREF> can do <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> if <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a VCR recorder .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> need only *-1 position <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> near a company 's satellite dish and wait .
`` You can have <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">a dozen competitors</COREF> stealing your secrets at the same time , '' <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Matchett</COREF> said *T*-1 , *PRO*-2 adding : `` It 's a pretty good bet 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wo n't get caught *-3 . ''
The only way 0 *PRO* to catch <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">an electronic thief</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *?* , is *PRO* to set <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> up with erroneous information .
Even though electronic espionage may cost U.S. firms billions of dollars a year , most are n't yet taking precautions , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the experts</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 .
By contrast , European firms will spend $ 150 million *U* this year on electronic security , and are expected *-1 to spend $ 1 billion *U* by 1992 .
Already <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">many foreign firms , especially banks ,</COREF> have <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own cryptographers , conference speakers reported 0 *T*-1 .
Still , *PRO* encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">One expert</COREF> , whose job *T*-1 is so politically sensitive that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> spoke on condition that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would n't be named or quoted *-2 ,</COREF> said 0 the expected influx of East European refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computer - maintenance workers , for example , doubling as foreign spies .
Moreover , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *?* , technology *ICH*-3 now exists for *PRO* stealing <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">corporate secrets</COREF> after <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've been `` erased *-1 '' from a computer 's memory .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Oliver North</COREF> of Iran - Contra notoriety</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had erased <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> computer but that the information was later retrieved *-1 for congressional committees to read .
No personal computer , not even the one on a chief executive 's desk , is safe , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">this speaker</COREF> noted 0 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">W. Mark Goode</COREF> , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">president of <COREF ID="55" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Micronyx Inc.</COREF> , <COREF ID="55" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a Richardson , Texas , firm that *T*-1 makes computer - security products</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> provided a new definition for <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mikhail Gorbachev 's</COREF> campaign for greater openness , known * commonly as glasnost .
Under <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gorbachev</COREF> , <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Goode</COREF> said 0 *?* , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviets</COREF> are openly stealing Western corporate communications .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> cited the case of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">a Swiss oil trader who *T*-2 recently put out bids *ICH*-1 via telex for an oil tanker 0 *T*-3 to pick up a cargo of crude in the Middle East</COREF> .
Among the responses 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the Swiss trader</COREF> got *T*-2 was *T*-3 one from the Soviet national shipping company , which *T*-1 had n't been invited *-4 *PRO*-5 to submit a bid .
<COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">The Soviets '</COREF> eavesdropping paid off , however , because <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> got the contract .
