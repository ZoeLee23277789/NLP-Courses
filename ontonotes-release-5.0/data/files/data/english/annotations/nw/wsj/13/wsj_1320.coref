Crude oil futures prices fell further as analysts and traders said 0 <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> oil producers are n't putting the brakes on output ahead of the traditionally weak first quarter .
In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange , the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude fell 39 cents a barrel to $ 19.76 *U* for <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">December</COREF> delivery .
Petroleum products prices also declined .
Analysts pointed to reports that <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries</COREF> is producing substantially more than <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> official limit of 20.5 million barrels a day , with some accounts putting <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the 13 - nation group 's</COREF> output *PRO*-1 as high as <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">23 million barrels a day</COREF> .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">That level of production</COREF> did n't take <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> toll on futures prices for the fourth quarter , when demand is traditionally strong *T*-1 .
But because first - quarter demand is normally the weakest of the year , several market participants say 0 *?* , <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">OPEC</COREF> production will have *-2 to decline *PRO* to keep prices from *PRO*-3 eroding further .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">The group</COREF> plans *PRO*-1 to meet in a month *PRO*-2 to discuss production strategy for early 1990 .
With prices already headed lower , news of a series of explosions at <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">a major <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Phillips Petroleum Co.</COREF> chemical facility on the Houston Ship Channel</COREF> also was bearish for prices .
Even though such facilities use a relatively small amount of crude , analysts say 0 *?* , now <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the facility</COREF> wo n't need any , at a time of already high availability .
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Phillips</COREF> plant</COREF> makes polyethylene , polypropylene and other plastic products .
A company official said 0 the explosions began when a seal blew out *T*-1 .
Dozens of workers were injured *-1 , authorities said 0 *T*-2 .
There was no immediate estimate of damage from <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> .
Some petroleum futures traders say 0 technical considerations now will help *PRO* to put downward pressure on futures prices .
For instance , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">one trader</COREF> said that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">prices</COREF> inevitably will go lower now that <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've fallen below $ 20 *U* a barrel .
`` Our technician is a little bearish now that we 've taken out $ 20 *U* , '' <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 .
In other commodity markets <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> :
COPPER :
The selling that *T*-1 started on Friday continued <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> .
The <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">December</COREF> contract fell 3.85 cents a pound to $ 1.1960 *U* .
London Metal Exchange warehouse stocks were down only 4,800 metric tons for the week to 84,500 tons ; expectations late last week were a drop of 10,000 to 15,000 tons .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">The New York market</COREF> made <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> high for <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the day</COREF> on the opening and when <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> dropped below the $ 1.23 *U* - a - pound level *T*-1 , <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">selling</COREF> picked up as <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">previous buyers</COREF> bailed out of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> positions and aggressive short sellers -- *PRO*-2 anticipating further declines -- <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">moved</COREF> in .
Fund selling also picked up at <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">that point</COREF> .
According to <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Bernard Savaiko</COREF> , <COREF ID="113" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">senior commodity analyst at <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">PaineWebber</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> the only stability to <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> came when <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">short sellers</COREF> periodically <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">moved</COREF> in *PRO*-2 to cover <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> positions by *PRO*-3 buying contracts *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">This activity</COREF> produced small rallies , which *T*-1 in turn attracted new short selling .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Savaiko</COREF> noted that copper had a steep fall in spite of <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">a weak dollar , which *T*-1 would normally support the U.S. copper market</COREF> .
Such support usually comes from arbitragers who *T*-1 use a strong British pound *PRO*-2 to buy copper in <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">The sell - off</COREF> would probably have been worse if <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> had been strong , '' <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 .
Copper has been stuck *-1 in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">a trading range of $ 1.19 to $ 1.34 *U*</COREF> .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Savaiko</COREF> believes that if copper falls below the bottom of <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">this range</COREF> the next significant support level will be about $ 1.04 *U* .
<COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">PRECIOUS METALS :</COREF>
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">Platinum and palladium</COREF> struggled *PRO*-2 to maintain <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> prices all day despite <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">news stories *ICH*-3 over <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the weekend</COREF> that recent cold fusion experiments , which *T*-1 use <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">both metals</COREF> , showed signs of *PRO* producing extra heat</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">January platinum</COREF> closed down $ 2.80 *U* an ounce at $ 486.30 *U* , nearly $ 4 *U* above <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> low for <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the day</COREF> .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">December</COREF> palladium was off $ 1.55 *U* an ounce at $ 137.20 *U* .
Platinum is believed *-1 to have good support around $ 480 *U* and palladium at around $ 130 *U* .
Some traders were thought *-3 to be waiting for the auto sales report , which *T*-2 will be released *-1 today .
Such sales are watched *-1 closely by platinum and palladium traders because <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">both metals</COREF> are used *-2 in automobile catalytic converters .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Savaiko</COREF> theorized that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the news on cold fusion</COREF> did n't affect <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> because many traders have already been badly burnt *-1 by such stories .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the traders</COREF> are demanding a higher level of proof before <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will buy palladium again .
Also weighing on <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">both metals '</COREF> prices is *T*-1 the role of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the chief supplier</COREF> , <COREF ID="116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Soviet Union</COREF></COREF> .
Many analysts believe that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviets '</COREF> thirst for dollars *ICH*-2 this year 0 *T*-1 to buy grain and other Western commodities and goods will bring <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> whenever prices rally very much *T*-3 .
GRAINS AND SOYBEANS :
Prices closed mixed as contracts reacted to largely offsetting bullish and bearish news .
On the Chicago Board of Trade , soybeans for November delivery closed at $ 5.63 *U* a bushel , down half a cent , while the <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">December</COREF> wheat contract rose three - quarters of a cent to $ 4.0775 *U* a bushel .
Supporting prices was *T*-1 the announcement late Friday of additional grain sales to <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviet Union</COREF> .
But acting as a drag on prices was *T*-1 the improved harvest weather over <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the weekend</COREF> and the prospect for continued fair weather this week over much of the Farm Belt .
Strong farmer selling over <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the weekend</COREF> also weighed on prices .
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">SUGAR :</COREF>
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">World prices</COREF> <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">tumbled</COREF> , mostly from <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own weight , according to analysts .
The March contract ended at 13.79 cents a pound , down 0.37 cent .
For the past week or so , traders have been expecting <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">India</COREF> to buy between 150,000 and 200,000 tons of refined sugar , and there have been expectations of a major purchase by Japan .
But with no reports of either country actually entering <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> , analysts said 0 *?* , futures prices became vulnerable .
Developing countries such as <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">India</COREF> , some analysts said *?* , seem *-2 to have made it *EXP*-3 a point *PRO* to stay away whenever <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">sugar</COREF> reached <COREF ID="128" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the top of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> trading range</COREF> , <COREF ID="128" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">around 14.75 cents</COREF> , *T*-4 and wait for prices to return to <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the bottom of the range</COREF> , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">around 13.50 cents</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Erik Dunlaevy</COREF> , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a sugar analyst with Balfour Maclaine International Ltd.</COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 the explanation for <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the latest drop in sugar prices</COREF> is much simpler : Speculators , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 *?* , `` got too long too soon and ran into resistance around the old contract highs . ''
A <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">PaineWebber</COREF> analyst said that in light of a new estimate of a production increase of four million metric tons and only a modest increase in consumption , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">sugar</COREF> is n't likely *-1 to rise above the top of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> trading range without a crop problem in a major producing country .
COCOA :
Futures rallied modestly .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">December</COREF> contract</COREF> rose $ 33 *U* a metric ton to $ 1,027 *U* , near <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> high for <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">the day</COREF> .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Gill -AMP- Duffus Ltd.</COREF> , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a British cocoa - trading house</COREF> , estimated that the 1989 - 90 world cocoa surplus would be 231,000 tons , down from 314,000 tons for the previous year .
Market technicians were encouraged *-1 by the price patterns , which *T*-2 in the past have preceded sharp rallies .
Recent prices for cocoa have been near levels last seen * in the mid-1970s .
At such prices , according to <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Savaiko</COREF> , bargain hunting and <COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">short - covering</COREF> -- <COREF ID="130" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">buying back of contracts previously sold</COREF> -- by speculators is n't uncommon .
But <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Savaiko</COREF> expects stepped - up producer selling at around the $ 1,040 to $ 1,050 *U* level .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also noted that <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">a strong sterling market</COREF> <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF> might have helped cocoa in <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> as arbitragers took advantage of the currency move .
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sandra Kaul</COREF> , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">research analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton</COREF> , said 0 <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> pushed higher mainly in anticipation of a late harvest in <COREF ID="123" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Ivory Coast</COREF> , <COREF ID="123" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a major cocoa producer</COREF> .
