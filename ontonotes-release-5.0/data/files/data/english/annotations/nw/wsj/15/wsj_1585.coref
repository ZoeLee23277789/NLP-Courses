As <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the sponsor of the `` Older Americans Freedom to Work Act , '' which *T*-1 would <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">repeal</COREF> <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Social Security</COREF> earnings limit for people aged * 65 and older</COREF> , I</COREF> applaud your strong endorsement 0 *T*-2 to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">repeal</COREF> <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">this Depression - era fossil</COREF> .
For every dollar earned * over $ <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">8,880</COREF> *U* , <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Social Security</COREF> recipients</COREF> <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">lose</COREF> 50 cents of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Social Security</COREF> benefits ; <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's like a 50 % marginal tax .
But the compounded effects of `` seniors only '' taxes result in truly catastrophic marginal tax rates .
*PRO* Imagine <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">a widow who *T*-1 wants *PRO*-3 to maintain her standard of living at the same level 0 she had *T*-2 before she had *-4 to pay <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the catastrophic surtax</COREF></COREF> .
Although <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">this widow</COREF> earns only twice the minimum wage , largely due to <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the earnings limit</COREF> , <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> would have *-1 to earn an additional $ 4,930 *U* *PRO*-2 to offset <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> catastrophic surtax of $ 496 *U* .
*PRO* Eliminating <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the earnings limit</COREF> would greatly help seniors and reduce the deficit .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Repeal</COREF> would generate more in new taxes than <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> would lose *?* in increased <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Social Security</COREF> benefit payments .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> now need support from <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats on <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the Rules Committee</COREF></COREF> in order *PRO*-1 to include earnings - limit reform in <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the Reconciliation Bill</COREF> .
Since all four Republicans on <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> are co-sponsors of <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> bill</COREF> , it is <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the Democrats</COREF> who *T*-2 will be held *-1 fully accountable if an earnings test amendment *ICH*-4 is not allowed *-3 from the floor .
The time *ICH*-2 is now 0 *PRO* to lift <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the burdensome <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">Social Security</COREF> earnings limit</COREF> from the backs of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">our nation 's</COREF> seniors *T*-1 .
