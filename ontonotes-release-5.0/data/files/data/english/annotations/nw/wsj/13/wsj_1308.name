We 've heard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's property - tax - cutting <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Proposition 13</ENAMEX> blamed for a lot over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the years</ENAMEX> , but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">ABC</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Koppel</ENAMEX> came up with a new wrinkle in his earthquake coverage <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> when he asked <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Democratic</ENAMEX> Assemblyman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Katz</ENAMEX> if <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Prop. 13</ENAMEX> had withheld money needed for road maintenance .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katz</ENAMEX> happily agreed , sliding over the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> 's roads and bridges are n't funded by property taxes but by state and federal gasoline taxes .
Both have been raised <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">at least 30 %</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , even while the price of gasoline has fallen .
Dragging <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Prop. 13</ENAMEX> into this story is a pretty long stretch .
