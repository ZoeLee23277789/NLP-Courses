Bond prices took the high road and stock prices took the low road as worries mounted about the economy and the junk bond market .
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">26.23</ENAMEX> points to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">2662.91</ENAMEX> in sluggish trading .
But long - term <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> bonds staged a modest rally , with prices on most issues rising <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about half a</ENAMEX> point , or $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</ENAMEX> for each $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,000</ENAMEX> face amount .
The dollar sagged against other major currencies in lethargic trading .
Traders and analysts said the divergence between the stock and bond markets is a sign of growing unease about the economic outlook .
A sinking economy depresses corporate earnings and thus stock prices , but it buoys bond prices as interest rates fall .
That unease is expected to grow <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> when the government reports on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September</ENAMEX> durable goods orders and again <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</ENAMEX> when the first assessment of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">third - quarter</ENAMEX> economic growth is released .
Analysts say they think durable goods orders fell <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 1 %</ENAMEX> , compared with a <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">3.9 %</ENAMEX> gain in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">August</ENAMEX> , and that growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the third quarter</ENAMEX> slowed to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">about 2.3 %</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the second quarter 's</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.5 %</ENAMEX> .
The stock market 's decline , coming after a record <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">weekly</ENAMEX> gain of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">119.88</ENAMEX> points , surprised some investors .
But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">A.C. Moore</ENAMEX> , director of research at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Argus Research</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week 's</ENAMEX> rally was a reflex reaction to the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 13</ENAMEX> stock market rout .
Overall , he said , the trend in stock prices will be down as the economy weakens .
`` We think we 're on target in looking for renewed economic deterioration , '' he said .
`` Corporate profits are going to decrease faster than interest rates will fall , and the probability is that we 'll see negative economic growth in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the fourth quarter</ENAMEX> . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hugh Johnson</ENAMEX> , chief investment officer at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">First Albany Corp.</ENAMEX> , agreed that a deteriorating economy is worrisome , but he said the real concern among stock investors is that some new problem will crop up in the junk bond market .
In major market activity : Stock prices slumped in sluggish trading .
Volume on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> totaled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">135.9 million</ENAMEX> shares .
Declining issues on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Big Board</ENAMEX> were ahead of gainers , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">1,012</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">501</ENAMEX> .
Bond prices rallied .
The yield on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Treasury</ENAMEX> 's benchmark <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 - year</ENAMEX> bond slipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7.93 %</ENAMEX> .
The dollar weakened against most other major currencies .
In late <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">New York</ENAMEX> trading , the dollar was quoted at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8470 marks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">141.90 yen</ENAMEX> , compared with <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1.8578 marks</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">142.43 yen</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">late Friday</ENAMEX> .
