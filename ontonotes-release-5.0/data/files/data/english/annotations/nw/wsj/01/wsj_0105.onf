    According to Dr. Wright, homelessness is `` simultaneously a housing problem, an employment problem, a demographic
    problem, a problem of social disaffiliation, a mental health problem, a family violence problem, a problem created by
    the cutbacks in social welfare spending, a problem resulting from the decay of the traditional nuclear family, and a
    problem intimately connected to the recent increase in the number of persons living below the poverty level. ''

    Of the approximately 200 sponsors of the recent march in Washington for the homeless, you chose to cite such groups as
    the National Association of Home Builders and the International Union of Bricklayers and Allied Craftsmen, insinuating

    the crusade was based on greed or the profit motive.
