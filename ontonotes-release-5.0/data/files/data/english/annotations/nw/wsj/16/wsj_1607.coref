Until now , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">BNL 's</COREF> top managers and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> directors have been appointed *-1 by a <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> decree .
But under <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the bank 's</COREF> proposed statutes , an assembly of shareholders must approve board members .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The bank 's</COREF> chairman and director general , who *T*-2 also sit on the board , still would be appointed *-1 by <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury</COREF> .
