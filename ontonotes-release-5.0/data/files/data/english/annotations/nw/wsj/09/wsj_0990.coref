<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> reluctance *PRO* to support <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the proposal</COREF> is another blow to <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the capital - gains cut , which *T*-1 has had a roller - coaster existence since the beginning of the year , when it was considered *-2 dead *T*-3 and then suddenly revived *-2 and was passed *-2 by <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF></COREF> .
Nevertheless , <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood</COREF> , <COREF ID="151" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the ranking GOP member on the tax - writing Senate Finance Committee</COREF> ,</COREF> last night introduced <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> plan</COREF> as an amendment to a pending measure authorizing U.S. aid for Poland and Hungary .
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB-</COREF> was confident 0 <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had enough votes *PRO* to block <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the maneuver</COREF> on procedural grounds , perhaps as soon as today .
<COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Packwood</COREF> all but conceded defeat , *PRO*-1 telling <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mitchell</COREF> : `` <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> sense at this stage 0 <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> may have the votes . ''
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The two lawmakers</COREF> sparred in a highly personal fashion , *PRO*-1 violating usual <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> decorum .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> tone was good - natured , with <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Packwood</COREF> saying 0 <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> intended *PRO*-1 to offer <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the proposal</COREF> again and again on future legislation and <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Mitchell</COREF> saying 0 <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> intended *PRO*-2 to use procedural means *PRO* to block <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> again and again .
Although <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the proposal</COREF> , authored * by <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Packwood</COREF> and <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. William Roth -LRB- R. , Del. -RRB-</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> appears *-1 to have general backing by <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">Republicans</COREF> , <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> votes are n't sufficient *PRO* to pass <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">Democrats , who *T*-1 are under increasing pressure *ICH*-2 from their leaders *PRO* to reject <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the gains - tax cut</COREF> ,</COREF> are finding reasons *PRO* to say no , at least for now .
A major reason is that <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> believe 0 <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">Packwood</COREF> - <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Roth</COREF></COREF> plan</COREF> would lose buckets of revenue over the long run .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">Packwood</COREF> - <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Roth</COREF></COREF> proposal</COREF> would reduce <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">the tax</COREF> depending on how long an asset was held *-1 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> also would create a new individual retirement account that *T*-1 would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made * for a wide variety of purposes , including retirement , medical expenses , first - home purchases and tuition .
`` A number of <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> are not going *-2 to touch <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">capital gains , IRAs or anything else</COREF> unless <COREF ID="186" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> contributes to deficit - reduction , '' said *T*-3 Sen. Charles Robb -LRB- D. , Va. -RRB- , who *T*-1 is one of <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the 10 to 20 Democrats who the <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration believes 0 *T*-4 might favor *PRO*-5 giving preferential treatment to capital gains</COREF> .
<COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> has been hearing this kind of opposition first hand during meetings over the past two days with Democratic senators at the White House .
And at a luncheon meeting Tuesday of Democratic senators , there was outspoken opposition to *PRO* cutting <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">the capital - gains tax</COREF> this year , according to participants .
The trend is making advocates of <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the tax cut</COREF> less optimistic about success .
`` There is a one - out - of - three shot of *PRO* getting <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> this year , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="159" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma</COREF> , <COREF ID="159" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a leading Democratic proponent of *PRO* cutting <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">the capital - gains tax</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> called the battle *PRO*-1 `` uphill . ''
Other Democrats who *T*-1 favor a capital - gains cut are even more pessimistic .
`` There will be no capital - gains bill this year , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Dale Bumpers -LRB- D. , Ark . -RRB-</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm probably not going *-1 to vote for any capital - gains proposal .
The IRA portion -LRB- of <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">Packwood</COREF> - <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Roth</COREF></COREF> plan</COREF> -RRB- is irresponsible . ''
Another significant factor in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the capitalgains debate</COREF> is the extent to which <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has become a purely political battle between <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> and <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Senate Majority Leader Mitchell</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mitchell</COREF> has made clear to <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wavering colleagues that the issue is important to <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">him personally</COREF> .
Today , <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Mitchell</COREF> and other leading Democrats plan *PRO*-1 to turn up the heat again by *PRO*-2 holding a news conference *PRO*-3 to bash <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the proposal</COREF> .
Estimates requested * by <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Mitchell</COREF> from the Congressional Joint Taxation Committee show that the richest 100 taxpayers got an average benefit from the capital - gains differential of $ 13 million *U* each in <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">1985</COREF> , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the last year for which figures are available *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">White House</COREF> officials</COREF> acknowledged yesterday that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Democrats</COREF> still are reluctant *PRO*-1 to publicly express support for <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">Packwood</COREF> - <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Roth</COREF></COREF> capital gains proposal</COREF> because <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are loath *PRO*-2 to buck <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Mitchell</COREF> .
As a result , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the officials</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are open to *PRO* making a variety of deals with <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">Senate</COREF> Democrats</COREF> *PRO* to win <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> support for a capital - gains tax cut .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Democrats</COREF> asked in * this week for discussions with <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF></COREF> have suggested ways of *PRO* `` tinkering '' with <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">Packwood</COREF> - <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">Roth</COREF></COREF> proposal</COREF> , *PRO*-3 suggesting an interest in *PRO* looking for a modified version 0 <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can back *T*-1 , one official said 0 *T*-2 .
In addition , <COREF ID="162" TYPE="IDENT">White House</COREF> aides think that there are numerous other important measures 0 Democrats badly wanted *T*-2 passed *-3 -- such as the scaling back of a controversial catastrophic health - care plan for the elderly -- that *T*-1 might provide <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> leverage in *PRO* cutting deals with Democrats .
A capital - gains tax cut might be paired *-1 with such measures *PRO* to help *PRO* ensure passage .
Other possibilities include a child - care initiative and an increase in the minimum wage .
If <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ca n't secure immediate passage of a capital - gains plan , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">administration officials</COREF> also are n't ruling out *PRO*-1 making a deal with <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> *PRO* to put off a vote until a firm date in the future , even next year .
But <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the officials</COREF> insist that such a deal on a future vote would have *-1 to apply to <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">both <COREF ID="154" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF> and <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF></COREF> .
