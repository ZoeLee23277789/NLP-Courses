<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Jobs</ENAMEX> took a step back from the frontier of personal - computer technology in an effort to spur sales of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next Inc. 's</ENAMEX> new machine .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> moved to remedy a couple of his computer 's drawbacks <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> by lowering the entry - level price for a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> machine by $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">1,500</ENAMEX> , or <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">23 %</ENAMEX> , if the buyer chooses a hard - disk drive as an alternative to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> 's optical - storage device .
The hard drive , which is the storage device of choice for virtually every desktop computer user , also now will supplement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> 's futuristic optical device if buyers pay full price .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> , co-founder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple Computer Inc.</ENAMEX> , founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years ago</ENAMEX> in the hopes of fomenting a revolution in the way desktop computers are designed and used .
His <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> computer , introduced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about a year ago</ENAMEX> and aimed primarily at university computer users , sports snazzy graphics , digital sound , built - in networking and a sleek black design .
But the computer was proving a hard sell because of its high price , a lack of software and an optical data - storage device that was too slow .
The machine began shipping at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the end of last year</ENAMEX> .
The closely held company has n't disclosed sales .
However , most universities that have bought the machines say they are buying small numbers for evaluation purposes .
Universities can now buy a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> computer without an optical storage device for $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4,995</ENAMEX> .
A computer with the optical device will still cost $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">6,495</ENAMEX> , but from now on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> will outfit every computer with a hard drive and supply one at no cost to those who have already bought <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> machines .
Commercial customers can purchase the same system through <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Businessland Inc.</ENAMEX> , a computer retailer based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Calif.</ENAMEX> , for <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">roughly $ 3,000</ENAMEX> more .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> said the changes were prompted by requests from customers who are frustrated with the performance of the optical device , which is n't offered as standard equipment by any rivals .
Another factor was that customers were asking , `` Why do n't you give us a cheaper system ? '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> said at a conference on university computing here .
Optical - storage devices can handle very large amounts of data and make it far easier to edit film clips or audio recordings with a computer .
But the technology , while reliable , is far slower than the widely used hard drives .
To get around the delays caused by the optical device , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Businessland</ENAMEX> , which is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> 's exclusive dealer to corporations , has for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> been advising customers to purchase hard drives with the machines .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> 's decision to rely on the more - established hard drive in every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> computer does n't signal a retreat from optical storage , said Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> , who for <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">years</ENAMEX> has said this technology will play a crucial role in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next decade</ENAMEX> .
`` We 're extremely committed to optical storage technology '' he said .
`` We think everything will go this way in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a few years</ENAMEX> . ''
He said that the next generation of optical drives will be as fast as hard drives , but he depends on outside suppliers for the devices .
But university computer specialists , who welcomed the move , called it a necessary retreat from the cutting edge of technology and one that 's likely to increase <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> 's sales on campuses .
`` From the standpoint of being on the forefront of technology , this is a step backward , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry W. Sprecher</ENAMEX> , a senior computing manager for the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> state university system .
`` But it will definitely boost <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> 's sales . ''
Universities , however , say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> 's prices must go even lower before large numbers of students purchase the machine .
`` We 'd still like to see a student model , '' priced at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">about $ 3,500</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Johnson</ENAMEX> , director of academic computing at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Minnesota</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gustavus Adolphus College</ENAMEX> , which has bought <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">eight</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> machines .
Broad acceptance of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> 's computer also is hindered by difficulty in distributing software for it .
Most software is distributed on cheap floppy disks , but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> computer does n't come with a device that reads them .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> 's computer also needs more software applications , but Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jobs</ENAMEX> said he expects more soon .
He said he expects <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lotus Development Corp.</ENAMEX> to introduce a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> version of its popular <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">1 - 2 - 3</ENAMEX> spreadsheet program in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</ENAMEX> .
Educators added that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Next</ENAMEX> needs to soon offer a color version of its computer .
Every major maker offers computers with color displays .
Next wo n't comment on when it will do the same , but is believed to have a color model under development .
