<ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Silicon Valley</ENAMEX> heaved a sigh of relief <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
Though details were sketchy in the aftermath of the violent earthquake that shook the high - tech corridor along with the rest of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">San Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> area , a spot check of computer makers turned up little , if any , potentially lingering damage to facilities or fabrication equipment .
Analysts and corporate officials said they expected practically no long - term disruption in shipments from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Valley</ENAMEX> of either hardware or software goods .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Advanced Micro Devices Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">National Semiconductor Corp.</ENAMEX> were all up and running <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , though many workers were forced to stay home because of damaged roadways ; others elected to take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the day</ENAMEX> off .
`` These systems are more rugged than many people would believe , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Kurlak</ENAMEX> , who tracks the computer industry for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Merrill Lynch Research</ENAMEX> .
`` It 's not the end of the world if you shake them up a little bit . ''
Other companies , including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">International Business Machines Corp.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hewlett - Packard Co.</ENAMEX> , completely idled their operations because of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</ENAMEX> 's temblor , which registered <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">6.9</ENAMEX> on the Richter scale .
Personnel spent <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">the morning</ENAMEX> inspecting buildings for structural weaknesses , mopping up water from broken pipes and clearing ceiling tiles and other debris from factory floors .
Still , many were confident that `` in a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> , everything should be back to normal , '' according to a spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Semiconductor Industry Association</ENAMEX> , based in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cupertino</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">IBM</ENAMEX> , for instance , said it anticipates returning to a normal work schedule by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the weekend</ENAMEX> at its <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> plant , which puts out disk drives for the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">3090</ENAMEX> family of mainframes .
A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hewlett - Packard</ENAMEX> spokeswoman said that , while `` things are a big mess , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">some 18,000</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Valley</ENAMEX> employees have been called back to work <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Apple Computer</ENAMEX> added that it was being `` cautiously optimistic , '' despite not yet closely eyeballing all of its <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50</ENAMEX> buildings in the region .
Even the carefully calibrated machinery in its giant <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fremont</ENAMEX> plant , to the north of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Valley</ENAMEX> , was believed to be undamaged .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sun Microsystems Inc.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Tandem Computers Inc.</ENAMEX> also signaled that they should recover quickly .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital Equipment Corp.</ENAMEX> , with major facilities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Santa Clara</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cupertino</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mountain View</ENAMEX> , said that all of its engineering and manufacturing sites had reported to corporate headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Maynard</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Mass.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">night</ENAMEX> .
None sustained `` significant '' damage , a spokesman said , adding that `` the delicate manufacturing process machines were checked and were all found to be operating normally . ''
For many companies , of course , there is still a slew of nagging problems to grapple with , some of which have the potential to become quite serious .
For example , a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Advanced Micro Devices</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX> chip maker is worried about blackouts .
A sudden surge or drop in electric power could ruin integrated circuits being built .
But , given what might have happened to the fragile parts that are at the heart of the microelectronics business , the bulk of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Valley</ENAMEX> companies seemed to be just about shouting hosannas .
Several factors apparently spared the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Valley</ENAMEX> -- a sprawling suburban stretch from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Jose</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Palo Alto</ENAMEX> -- from the kind of impact felt in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , an <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">hour</ENAMEX> 's drive north .
For <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> thing , buildings there tend to be newer and , thus , in step with the latest safety codes .
Also , the soil in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Valley</ENAMEX> is solid , unlike the landfill of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco 's</ENAMEX> downtown <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Marina District</ENAMEX> , which was hit with fires and vast destruction .
In addition , some microelectronics companies said they were prepared for tremulous conditions like <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> 's .
Their machine tools are even bolted to the shop floor .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel</ENAMEX> said that over <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past decade</ENAMEX> , it has installed computer sensors and shutoff valves , sensitive to the shake of an earthquake , in the pipes that snake through its plants .
Like other large <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Valley</ENAMEX> companies , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Intel</ENAMEX> also noted that it has factories in several parts of the nation , so that a breakdown at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> location should n't leave customers in a total pinch .
That 's certainly good news for such companies as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Compaq Computer Corp.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Houston</ENAMEX> , which has only a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four - day</ENAMEX> supply of microprocessors from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Valley</ENAMEX> on hand because of a just - in - time manufacturing approach that limits the buildup of inventory .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Compaq</ENAMEX> said it foresees no difficulties in obtaining parts in the immediate future .
Computer makers were scrambling to help customers recover from the disaster .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital Equipment</ENAMEX> has set up disaster - recovery response centers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Dallas</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Colo</ENAMEX> .
These units were handling calls both from people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> area and from computers themselves , which are set to dial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> automatically when trouble arises .
They then run remotely controlled self - diagnostic programs .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Digital</ENAMEX> also said it has dispatched teams of technicians to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">California</ENAMEX> .
Meanwhile , several other major installations around the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Valley</ENAMEX> -- <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's center of high - tech -- said they , too , fared as well as could be expected .
<ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</ENAMEX> , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Energy Department</ENAMEX> tests and conducts research on nuclear weapons , had only `` superficial damage , '' a spokesman said .
At <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lockheed Corp. 's</ENAMEX> missiles and space systems group in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">about 40 miles</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">San Francisco</ENAMEX> , workers were asked to head to work <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> after it was realized that `` there were no show - stoppers '' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">150 - plus</ENAMEX> buildings on its <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one - square - mile</ENAMEX> campus .
Several engineering and research offices needed closer scrutiny to make sure they were n't in danger of crumbling , but `` the bulk of the place is in pretty good shape , '' an official said .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Lockheed</ENAMEX> 's most lucrative sectors -- accounting for <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than half</ENAMEX> the aerospace company 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 10.59 billion</ENAMEX> in sales in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</ENAMEX> -- the missiles and space group is the prime <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Pentagon</ENAMEX> contractor on the <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Trident II</ENAMEX> ballistic missile .
It also generates pieces of the missile shield called <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">the Strategic Defense Initiative</ENAMEX> .
Fortunately , <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Hubble Space Telescope</ENAMEX> -- set to be launched on the shuttle <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> in a search for distant solar systems and light emitted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">14 billion years ago</ENAMEX> from the farthest reaches of the universe -- was moved from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Sunnyvale</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="FAC">the Kennedy Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Florida</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of October</ENAMEX> .
