How interestingly clever *T*-3 of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Robert Goldberg</COREF> *PRO*-1 to use the form of pretend advocacy journalism *PRO*-2 to explain <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> perception of `` <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Days of Rage</COREF> '' in <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> television critique -LRB- Leisure -AMP- Arts , Sept 11 -RRB- .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> chastises <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Jo Franklin - Trout</COREF> for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> inept presentation of advocacy journalism , *PRO*-1 judging <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> project</COREF> as `` intellectually slipshod . ''
Was not the title very clear ?
One example 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gives *T*-1 : `` <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> did n't ask '' -LRB- why the Palestinian children are soldiers throwing stones *T*-2 -RRB- .
Really now , did <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> have *-1 to ask ?
Were not the pictures and happenings , which *T*-1 have been continuing news headlines , answers enough ?
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Goldberg</COREF> contends that even as `` propaganda '' <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the film</COREF> fails because <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> presents only one view .
Of course <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the Palestinians</COREF> complain about <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> treatment ; of course the Israelis feel put upon .
But <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> complaint that `` <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Days of Rage</COREF> '' does n't contain balanced comments from Israelis about how badly the Palestinians are behaving *T*-1 is irrelevant .
It 's like *PRO* doing a documentary on apartheid and insisting that equal time be given *-1 to how terrific white South Africans are *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">This film</COREF> did emphasize how long the Israeli / Palestinian stalemate has existed *T*-3 by *PRO*-7 tracing the conflict to the days of World War I when the British tried *PRO*-4 to guarantee both a Jewish state and a Palestinian state without *PRO*-6 specifying how it was *PRO*-8 to be done *-1 *T*-5 *T*-2 .
Well , `` Days of Rage '' airing with before - and - after packaging , and after repeated delays , was a beginning .
Every issue is multisided .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">This film</COREF> attempts *PRO*-1 to show a side rarely seen in our media .
Now we must endure a rash of critics who *T*-1 apparently wish *PRO*-2 to know details of one side only .
Salaam .
Shalom .
