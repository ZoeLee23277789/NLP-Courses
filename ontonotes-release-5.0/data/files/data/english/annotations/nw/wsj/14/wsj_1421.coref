<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Japan 's</COREF> Finance Ministry</COREF> strongly denied *PRO*-1 playing any role in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> stock - price free fall</COREF> .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Makoto Utsumi</COREF> , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">vice minister for international affairs</COREF> ,</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the ministry</COREF> did n't in any way suggest to <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese banks</COREF> that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stay out of <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">UAL Corp.</COREF> leveraged buy - out</COREF> .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The ministry</COREF> has never even suggested that Japanese banks be cautious about leveraged buy - outs in general , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Utsumi</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 .
`` There are no facts -LCB- behind the assertions -RCB- that <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> sent any kind of signal , '' <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> declared *T*-2 in an interview .
The comments were <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the ministry 's</COREF> first detailed public statement on the subject , and reflect <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the ministry 's</COREF> concern that foreigners will think 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF> is using <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> tremendous financial power *PRO*-1 to control events in foreign markets .
A number of accounts of the events leading to <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the 190 point drop in <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> stock prices on Oct. 13</COREF> accused the ministry of *PRO* pulling the plug on <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">UAL</COREF> deal</COREF> for one reason or another .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Utsumi</COREF> said 0 the most 0 <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the ministry</COREF> had ever done *T*-1 was *PRO* ask <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese banks</COREF> about `` the status of <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> participation '' in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">one previous U.S. leveraged buy - out</COREF> .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The ministry</COREF> <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">inquired</COREF> about <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">that deal -- which <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Utsumi</COREF> declined *PRO*-3 to identify *T*-2 --</COREF> because the large presence of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese banks</COREF> in <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the deal</COREF> was `` being strongly criticized *-1 in the U.S. Congress '' and it *EXP*-4 was `` necessary for <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> to grasp the situation . ''
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the inquiry</COREF> was n't made in a way that <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the banks</COREF> could have interpreted *T*-2 as *PRO*-1 either encouraging or discouraging participation , and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> added that <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">none of <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese banks</COREF></COREF> changed <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> posture on <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the deal</COREF> as a result of <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the inquiry</COREF> .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Utsumi</COREF> also said 0 <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">some Japanese banks</COREF> were willing *PRO*-2 to participate in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">UAL</COREF> financing</COREF> up to the very end , which *T*-1 would suggest at the very least that <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were n't under orders *PRO* to back out .
In general , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Utsumi</COREF> said *?* , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese banks</COREF> are becoming more `` independent '' in <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> approach to overseas deals .
`` <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Each Japanese bank</COREF> has <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own judgment on the profits and risks in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">that -LCB- <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">UAL</COREF> -RCB- deal</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are becoming more independent .
It 's a sound phenomenon . ''
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Sanwa Bank Ltd.</COREF> is one Japanese bank that *T*-1 <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">decided</COREF> *PRO*-2 not to participate in <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the first <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">UAL</COREF> proposal</COREF> .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">A <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Sanwa Bank</COREF> spokesman</COREF> denied that <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the finance ministry</COREF> played any part in <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the bank 's decision</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> made <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> own decision</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 .
Still , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Utsumi</COREF> may have a hard time *PRO*-2 convincing market analysts who *T*-1 have rightly or wrongly believed that <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the ministry</COREF> played a role in *PRO* orchestrating recent moves by Japanese banks .
All week there has been much speculation *ICH*-1 in financial circles in Tokyo and abroad about <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the ministry 's</COREF> real position .
Bank analysts say 0 ministry officials have been growing increasingly concerned *ICH*-1 during the past few months about <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese banks</COREF> getting in over <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> heads .
`` <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The -LCB- ministry -RCB-</COREF> thinks 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">the banks</COREF> do n't know what <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are doing *T*-2 , that <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have very little idea how *PRO* to cope with risk *T*-3 , '' said *T*-4 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">one foreign bank analyst who *T*-1 asked *PRO*-5 not to be identified *-6</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">The -LCB- ministry -RCB-</COREF> wants *PRO*-2 to see <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese banks</COREF> pull in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> horns '' on leveraged buy - outs , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> added 0 *T*-1 .
Although <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">some of the Japanese banks involved in <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the first proposed bid for <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">UAL</COREF></COREF></COREF> bowed out because <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> found the terms unattractive , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">observers</COREF> here say 0 <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have a hard time *PRO*-1 believing that commercial considerations were the only reason .
Japanese banks are under `` political pressure '' as well , <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the analyst</COREF> said 0 *T*-1 .
Moreover , analysts point out that Japanese banks have a reputation for *PRO*-2 doing <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">deals that *T*-1 are n't extremely profitable</COREF> if <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> offer the chance *PRO* to build market share , cement an important business relationship or curry favor with powerful bureaucrats .
Clearly , some financial authorities are concerned about the Japanese banks role in leveraged buy - outs .
At a news conference this week , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Bank of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Japan</COREF></COREF> Gov. Satoshi Sumita</COREF> <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">cautioned</COREF> banks *PRO*-1 to take a `` prudent '' stance regarding highly leveraged deals .
Despite <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Sumita 's</COREF> statements</COREF> , it is <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the Finance Ministry</COREF> , not <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the central bank</COREF> , that *T*-1 makes policy decisions .
While recent events may cool some of the leveraged buy - out fever , Japanese banks are n't likely *-1 to walk away from the game .
Despite the risks , the deals can be an attractive way for <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese banks</COREF> to increase <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> presence in the U.S. market , bank analysts say 0 *T*-1 .
*PRO*-2 Flush with cash at <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">home</COREF> , but with fewer customers to lend to *-1 , leading banks are eager *PRO* to expand overseas .
*PRO* Jumping in on big deals is a high profile way 0 *T*-1 to leapfrog the problem of *PRO* not having a strong retail - banking network .
