As competition heats up in <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Spain 's</COREF> crowded bank market</COREF> , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior de Espana</COREF> is seeking *PRO*-1 to shed <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> image of a state - owned bank and move into new activities .
Under the direction of <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> new chairman</COREF> , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Francisco Luzon</COREF> ,</COREF> <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Spain 's</COREF> seventh largest bank</COREF> is undergoing a tough restructuring that analysts say 0 *T*-1 may be the first step toward <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the bank 's</COREF> privatization .
The state - owned industrial holding company Instituto Nacional de Industria and the Bank of Spain jointly hold a 13.94 % stake in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> .
<COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">The government</COREF> directly owns 51.4 % and <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Factorex</COREF> , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a financial services company</COREF> , holds 8.42 % .
The rest is listed *-1 on Spanish stock exchanges .
<COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">Some analysts</COREF> are concerned , however , that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> may have waited too long *PRO*-1 to diversify from <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> traditional export - related activities .
*PRO* Catching up with commercial competitors in retail banking and financial services , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> argue 0 *?* , will be difficult , particularly if market conditions turn sour .
If that proves *-5 true , analysts say 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> could be a prime partner -- or even a takeover target -- for either a Spanish or foreign bank seeking *PRO* to increase its market share after 1992 , when the European Community plans *PRO*-3 to dismantle financial barriers *T*-4 .
With 700 branches in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Spain</COREF> and 12 banking subsidiaries , five branches and 12 representative offices abroad , the <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> group has a lot 0 *PRO* to offer a potential suitor *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Luzon</COREF> and <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> team</COREF> , however , say 0 <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are n't interested in a merger .
Instead , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are working *PRO*-1 to transform <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> into an efficient bank by the end of 1992 .
`` <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> to be a model of the way 0 a public - owned company should be run *-1 *T*-3 , '' <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Luzon</COREF> says *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> was created *-1 in 1929 *PRO*-1 to provide subsidized credits for Spanish exports .
The market for export financing was liberalized *-1 in the mid-1980s , however , *PRO* forcing <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the bank</COREF> *PRO*-2 to face competition .
At the same time , many of <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Spain 's</COREF> traditional export markets in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Latin America</COREF> and other developing areas faced a sharp decline in economic growth .
As a result , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the volume</COREF> of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior 's</COREF> export credit portfolio</COREF> <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">plunged</COREF> from <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">824 billion pesatas</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">$ 7.04 billion</COREF> *U* -RRB- as of Dec. 31 , 1986 , to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> current 522 billion pesetas .
<COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The other two main pillars</COREF> of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior 's</COREF> traditional business -- <COREF ID="67" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">wholesale banking and foreign currency trading</COREF> -- also began *-1 to crumble under the weight of heavy competition and changing client needs .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">The bank</COREF> was hamstrung *-1 in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> efforts *PRO* to face the challenges of <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">a changing market</COREF> by <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> links to <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> , analysts say 0 *T*-2 .
Until <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Luzon</COREF> took the helm last November , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> was run *-1 by politicians who *T*-2 lacked either the skills *RNR*-3 or the will *RNR*-3 0 *PRO* to introduce innovative changes *T*-4 .
But <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Luzon</COREF> has moved swiftly *PRO*-1 to streamline bureaucracy , cut costs , increase capital and build up new areas of business .
`` <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've got a lot 0 *PRO* to do *T*-2 , '' <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> acknowledged *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've got *-1 to move quickly . ''
In <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Luzon 's</COREF> first year , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the bank</COREF> eliminated 800 jobs .
Now <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 'll trim another 1,200 jobs over the next three to four years .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">The bank</COREF> employs 8,000 people in <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Spain</COREF> and 2,000 abroad .
*PRO*-1 To strengthen <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> capital base , <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> this year issued $ 105 million *U* in subordinated debt , launched two rights issues and sold stock held * in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> treasury to small investors .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">The bank</COREF> is now aggressively marketing retail services at <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> domestic branches .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Last year 's drop in export credit</COREF> was partially offset *-1 by a 15 % surge in lending to individuals and small and medium - sized companies .
Though <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Spain</COREF> has an excess of banks , analysts say 0 <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> still has <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">one of the most profitable markets in Europe , which *T*-1 will aid <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> with the tough tasks 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> faces *T*-2 ahead</COREF> .
Expansion plans also include acquisitions in growing foreign markets .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">The bank</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's interested in *PRO*-1 purchasing banks in Morocco , Portugal and Puerto Rico .
But <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the bank 's</COREF> retail activities in <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Latin America</COREF> are likely *-1 to be cut *-2 back .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Banco Exterior</COREF> was one of the last banks 0 *T*-1 to create a brokerage house before <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the four Spanish stock exchanges</COREF> underwent sweeping changes in July .
The late start may be a handicap for <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the bank</COREF> as <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Spain</COREF> continues *-1 to open up <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> market</COREF> to foreign competition .
But <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Luzon</COREF> contends that the experienced team 0 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> brought *T*-1 with <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> from Banco Bilbao Vizcaya , where <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was formerly director general *T*-2 , will whip <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the bank 's</COREF> capital market division into shape by the end of 1992 .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">The bank</COREF> also says 0 <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 'll use <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> international network *PRO* to channel investment from London , Frankfurt , Zurich and Paris into <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the Spanish stock exchanges</COREF> .
