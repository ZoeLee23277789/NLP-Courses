In <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">a speech prepared * for delivery to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">London 's</COREF> financial community</COREF> , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lawson</COREF> summed up current economic policy as <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">a battle *PRO* to wring inflation out of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the British economy</COREF> , *PRO*-1 using high interest rates as `` the essential instrument '' 0 *PRO* to carry out <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the campaign</COREF> *T*-2</COREF> .
Two weeks after *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">boosting</COREF> <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">base rates</COREF> to 15 % , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> pledged that `` rates will have *-2 to remain high for some time 0 *T*-3 to come . ''
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lawson</COREF> also made it *EXP*-1 clear that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be watching exchange rates carefully .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">A sinking pound</COREF> makes imports more expensive and increases businesses ' expectations of future inflation , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> argued 0 *T*-1 .
In an apparent warning to currency traders who *T*-1 have lately been selling <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the British currency</COREF> , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> stated that the exchange rates will have a `` major role in the assessment of monetary conditions . ''
In *PRO*-1 reaffirming the current monetary policy of *PRO* using high interest rates *PRO*-2 to fight inflation and shore up <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the pound</COREF> , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lawson</COREF> dismissed other approaches to *PRO* managing <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> monitors <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the money - supply figures</COREF> , but does n't give <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> paramount importance , as some private and government economists have suggested 0 *?* .
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lawson</COREF> also dismissed the possibility of *PRO* imposing direct credit controls on <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Britain 's</COREF> financial system .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lawson 's</COREF> speech , delivered * at <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord Mayor of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> 's annual dinner at Mansion House</COREF> ,</COREF> came on the heels of a grueling period for <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the U.K. economy</COREF> .
Two weeks ago , in a campaign *PRO* to blunt inflation at home and arrest a world - wide plunge in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the pound</COREF> , he <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">raised</COREF> <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">base rates</COREF> a full percentage point to 15 % .
Despite <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the increase</COREF> , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the British currency</COREF> slid below a perceived threshold of three marks early last week .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was quoted *-1 at 2.9428 marks in late <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> trading Wednesday .
Leading up to <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the speech</COREF> was *T*-2 a drumroll of economic statistics suggesting that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the British war on inflation</COREF> will be more bruising than *PRO* previously assumed *-1 .

While lower joblessness is generally good news , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the hefty drop <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">last month</COREF></COREF> indicates that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> is n't slowing down as much as *PRO* hoped 0 *?* -- despite a doubling of interest rates over the last 16 months .
Meanwhile , average earnings in <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Britain</COREF> were up 8.75 % *ICH*-1 in August over <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the previous year</COREF> .
Another inflationary sign came in a surge in building - society lending to <COREF ID="20" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a record # 10.2 billion *U*</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="20" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">$ 16.22 billion</COREF> *U* -RRB- <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">last month</COREF> , <COREF ID="20" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a much higher level than economists had predicted *?*</COREF> .
In a separate speech prepared * for delivery at <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the dinner</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Robin Leigh - Pemberton</COREF> , <COREF ID="22" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Bank of England governor</COREF> ,</COREF> conceded that `` demand pressures were even more buoyant than *PRO* had been appreciated *-1 '' when <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the British economy</COREF> was heating up <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> added that `` there 's no quick - fix solution '' to the economic woes , and said 0 `` tight monetary policy is the right approach . ''
*PRO*-1 Discussing the recent slide in stock prices , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the central bank governor</COREF> stated that `` the markets now appear *-2 to have steadied '' after the `` nasty jolt '' of <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the 190.58 - point plunge in the Dow Jones Industrial Average a week ago</COREF> .
Although <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> market plunge</COREF> prompted <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">a 70.5 - point drop in the London Financial Times - Stock Exchange 100 Share Index</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Leigh - Pemberton</COREF> declared `` that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the experience</COREF> owed nothing to the particular problems of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the British economy</COREF> . ''
Specifically , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> pointed out that compared with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. market</COREF> , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the U.K.</COREF> has far fewer highly leveraged junk - bond financings .
*PRO*-1 Discussing future monetary arrangements , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Lawson</COREF> repeated the Thatcher government 's commitment *PRO* to join the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System , but <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did n't indicate when .
