Some U.S. allies are complaining that <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> is pushing <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">conventional - arms talks</COREF> too quickly , *PRO*-1 creating a risk that negotiators will make errors that *T*-105 could affect the security of Western Europe for years .
Concerns about the pace of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Vienna</COREF> talks -- which *T*-1 are aimed *-71 at the destruction of some 100,000 weapons , as well as major reductions and realignments of troops in central Europe --</COREF> also are being registered *-70 at <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the Pentagon</COREF> .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> has called for an agreement by next September at the latest .
But some American defense officials believe 0 <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the North Atlantic Treaty Organization</COREF> should take more time *PRO*-1 to examine the long - term implications of the options being considered * .
For one thing , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">Pentagon</COREF> officials , who *T*-106 asked *PRO*-3 not to be identified *-4 ,</COREF> worry that <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> will have a much tougher time *PRO*-2 persuading <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Europeans</COREF> *PRO*-5 to keep some short - range nuclear weapons on <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> soil once Soviet armored forces are thinned *-1 out .
At the same time , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> contend that a reduction of <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">NATO</COREF> forces under a treaty will increase the possibility of a conventional Soviet attack unless <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the West</COREF> retains a residual force of nuclear weapons in <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Europe</COREF> .
Allies concerned about the deadline include the British , French and smaller <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">NATO</COREF> allies , some of whom *T*-107 do n't have adequate staffs 0 *T*-1 to provide quick answers to the questions being raised * by what *T*-2 generally are considered *-72 <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the most complex arms - control talks ever attempted *</COREF> .
So far , no ally has complained openly , *PRO* preserving the impression that <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">NATO</COREF> is in line with the <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> position that a quick agreement bringing Soviet conventional forces down to parity with <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">NATO</COREF> is <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the West 's</COREF> top bargaining priority .
But even though <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">NATO</COREF> negotiators</COREF> have only 10 months left * under the <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> timetable , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are still wrestling over such seemingly fundamental questions as `` What *T*-108 is a tank ? ''
Five of the six categories of weapons under negotiation have n't even been defined *-73 .
Tanks currently are defined *-74 as armored vehicles weighing 25 tons or more that *T*-1 carry large guns .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">The Soviets</COREF> complicated <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> by *PRO*-1 offering *PRO*-2 to <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">include</COREF> light tanks , which *T*-109 are as light as 10 tons .
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Oleg A. Grinevsky</COREF> , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the chief Soviet negotiator in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the conventional - arms talks</COREF></COREF> , argued that <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> would mean 0 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviets</COREF> would have *-1 to destroy some 1,800 tanks , while <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> would lose none because <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has no light tanks in <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Europe</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> is stickier than <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> seems *-1 *?* .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">France , Britain and Italy</COREF> all have light tanks 0 <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would like *PRO*-2 to keep *T*-1 out of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the talks</COREF> .
And some U.S. Army analysts worry that the proposed Soviet redefinition is aimed *-75 at *PRO*-1 blocking <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> from *PRO*-2 developing lighter , more transportable , high - technology tanks .
*PRO* Defining combat aircraft is even tougher .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">The Soviets</COREF> insisted that aircraft be brought *-76 into <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the talks</COREF> , then argued for *PRO* exempting <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">some 4,000 Russian planes</COREF> because <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are `` solely defensive . ''
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">NATO</COREF> has n't budged from <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> insistence that any gun - carrying plane has offensive capability .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">The dispute</COREF> over that issue</COREF> , according to one U.S. official , is a `` potential treaty stopper , '' and only <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev may be able *PRO*-1 to resolve <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Accounting problems raise more knotty issues .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Greece and Turkey</COREF> , for example , are suspected *-77 of *PRO*-1 overstating <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> arsenals in hopes that <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can emerge from the arms - reduction treaty with large remaining forces 0 *T*-2 to deter <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">each other</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Other nations</COREF> are n't sure how many weapons <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *T*-1 in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own arsenals .
`` It 's just going *-2 to be sloppy , both on <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> side and <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">theirs</COREF> -LCB- <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Warsaw Pact 's</COREF> -RCB-</COREF> , '' says *T*-1 one <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">NATO</COREF> analyst .
So far , neither the <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> administration nor arms - control experts in Congress seem *-1 moved *-2 by arguments that these problems *ICH*-4 may take more time *ICH*-5 0 *PRO* to thrash *T*-3 out than <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> has allowed *?* .
They argue that the bigger danger would be that <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the West</COREF> would delay action so long that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviets</COREF> might back away from the current conciliatory attitude .
`` So what if you miss 50 tanks somewhere ? '' asks *T*-1 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Rep. Norman Dicks</COREF> -LRB- D. , Wash. -RRB- , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a member of the House group that *T*-110 visited <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the talks in <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Vienna</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> .
`` The bottom line is that if <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can get that <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">-LCB- Warsaw Pact -RCB-</COREF> superiority brought *-1 down to parity , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> ought *-2 to keep *-3 pressing ahead as quickly as possible .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> worry more about things becoming so unraveled *ICH*-2 on <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the other side</COREF> that <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> might become unable *PRO*-1 to negotiate .
