WHEN <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">JAMES SCHWARTZ</COREF> was just a lad *T*-1 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> father</COREF> gave <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a piece of career advice .
`` <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> told <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *PRO*-2 to choose an area where just by *PRO*-3 being mediocre <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could be great *T*-4 , '' recalls *T*-1 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Schwartz</COREF> , now <COREF ID="50" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">40</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> tried management consulting , traded in turquoise for a while , and even managed professional wrestlers .
Now <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has settled into <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="51" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a career that *T*-1 fits the bill</COREF> -- <COREF ID="51" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">financial planning</COREF></COREF> .
It *EXP*-4 should be noted *-1 that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Schwartz , who *T*-2 operates out of <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Englewood , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Colo.</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> is a puckish sort who *T*-3 likes *PRO*-5 to give <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> colleagues <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the needle</COREF> .
But in this case <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the needle</COREF> has a very sharp point .
Though it *ICH*-2 's probably safe *PRO* to assume that the majority of financial planners are honest and even reasonably competent , the fact remains that , as one wag puts it , `` <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">anybody who *T*-1 can fog a mirror</COREF> '' can call <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *PRO*-3 a financial planner .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">Planners</COREF> now influence the investment of several hundred billion dollars , but in effect <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> operate in the dark .
There is no effective regulation of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">planners</COREF> , no accepted standard for admission into <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ranks -- <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">a dog</COREF> got into <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">one trade group</COREF> -- no way 0 *PRO* to assess <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> performance *T*-1 , no way 0 even to know how many of <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> there are *T*-2 -LRB- estimates range from 60,000 to 450,000 -RRB- *T*-3 .
All 0 anyone need do *T*-1 is *PRO* hang up a shingle and start *-2 planning .
So it *EXP*-2 should come as no shock that <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the profession</COREF> , if that 's what <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-3 , has attracted a lot of people whose principal talents *T*-1 seem *-4 to be *PRO* frittering away *RNR*-5 or flat - out stealing *RNR*-5 their clients ' money .
*PRO*-1 Alarmed , state and federal authorities are trying *PRO*-1 to devise ways 0 *PRO* to certify and regulate planners *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Industry groups</COREF> and reputable planners who *T*-1 are members of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> want comprehensive standards , too ; <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're tired of *PRO*-2 seeing practitioners depicted *-3 collectively in the business press as dumber than chimpanzees and greedier than a herd of swine .
But reform has n't taken hold yet .
`` <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">The industry</COREF> is still pretty much in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Wild West days , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Scott Stapf</COREF> , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of investor education for <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the North American Securities Administrators Association</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
An admittedly limited survey by <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">NASAA , whose members *T*-1 are state securities - law regulators ,</COREF> found that between <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">1986</COREF> and <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">1988</COREF> `` fraud and abuse '' by financial planners cost 22,000 investors $ 400 million *U* .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">The rogues ' gallery of planners involved *</COREF> includes <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">some convicted felons , a compulsive gambler or two , various businessmen who *T*-1 had planned their own previous ventures right into bankruptcy , and one man who *T*-2 scammed his wife 's grandmother</COREF> .
What *T*-1 's more , the losses 0 <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> and the others</COREF> caused *T*-3 `` are just what <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are stumbling over *T*-2 , '' says 0 *T*-5 <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Stapf</COREF> , *PRO*-4 adding that the majority of misdeeds probably go *PRO*-6 undetected .
So do *?* just about all the losses that *T*-2 could be attributed *-1 to the sheer incompetence of unqualified planners .
Nobody can estimate the toll , but <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">John Gargan</COREF> , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Tampa , Fla. ,</COREF> planner and head of <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one trade group</COREF> , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the International Association of Registered Financial Planners</COREF></COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> thinks 0 the danger to investors from incompetence is `` humongous , '' far greater than that from crookery .
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> group</COREF> , like others , wants minimum standards applied *-2 to all who *T*-1 call themselves *PRO*-3 financial planners .
*PRO*-1 Surveying all this , some people now think 0 the best planner might be no planner at all .
For most investors `` the benefits just are n't worth the risks , '' says 0 *T*-2 <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">Barbara Roper , who *T*-1 follows financial - planning issues for <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Consumer Federation of America</COREF> , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a consumer - advocacy organization based * in Washington</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> concedes that <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">such a position</COREF> is `` unfair '' to the thousands of conscientious and qualified people plying <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">the trade</COREF> , but as a consumer advocate <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> feels impelled *-1 *PRO*-2 to take <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> group</COREF> used *-2 to give <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">tips on *PRO* selecting planners -- *PRO* check educational and experience credentials , consult regulators and Better Business Bureaus --</COREF> but found that even some people who *T*-1 took <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">these steps</COREF> `` were still getting ripped *-3 off . ''
The bad news , however , has n't been bad enough *PRO* to kill the growing demand for <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">financial planning</COREF> .
The Tax Reform Act of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">1986</COREF> , which *T*-1 eliminated many tax shelters peddled * by planners , and the stock market crash the next year did cause a sharp slump in such demand , and many planners had *-2 to make an unplanned exit from <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the business</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">membership in <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the International Association of Financial Planners</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">IAFP</COREF> -RRB- , <COREF ID="74" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the industry 's</COREF> biggest trade group</COREF> ,</COREF></COREF> is still nearly triple what <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was *T*-2 in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">1980</COREF> , and it *EXP*-3 's believed that the ranks of planners who *T*-1 do n't belong to any group have soared as well .
An estimated 10 million Americans are now using <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">financial planners</COREF> , and the pool of capital 0 <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> influence *T*-1 is enormous .
A survey of <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">54,000 of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> conducted * by <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the IAFP</COREF> in April showed that <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">these practitioners alone</COREF> had controlled or guided the investment of $ 154 billion *U* of <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> clients ' money in the previous 12 months .
The sheer number of <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">planners</COREF> makes <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the business</COREF> extremely difficult *RNR*-2 , if not impossible *RNR*-2 , 0 *PRO* to regulate *T*-1 .
Even the minority of <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> who *T*-1 must register with <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the Securities and Exchange Commission</COREF> as `` <COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">investment advisers</COREF> '' -- <COREF ID="77" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">people who *T*-2 are in the business of *PRO* counseling others on the buying and selling of securities specifically</COREF> -- have been enough *PRO* to swamp <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the agency 's</COREF> capacity .
<COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">The SEC</COREF> has only about 200 staffers assigned *PRO* to keep tabs on investment advisers -- about the same as in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">1980</COREF> -- even though the number of advisers has tripled to about 15,000 over the past decade .
Currently , a registered investment adviser can expect an <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">SEC</COREF> audit only once every 12 years .
A lot of bad things can happen in 12 years .
`` It does n't take a rocket scientist *PRO*-2 to figure out <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> problem , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Kathryn McGrath</COREF> , <COREF ID="78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC 's</COREF> division of investment management</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF> has <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">proposed</COREF> to Congress that much of the job of oversight be turned *-2 over to an industry - funded , self - regulatory organization patterned * on the National Association of Securities Dealers , which *T*-1 operates in the brokerage business .
Such an organization could , among other things , set minimum standards for competence , ethics and finances and punish those investment advisers who *T*-1 broke the rules .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">The proposal</COREF> has set off a lively debate within <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">an industry that *T*-1 was far from united to begin with</COREF> .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Schwartz</COREF> , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the puckish planner from <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">Englewood , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Colo.</COREF></COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> says that *PRO* allowing <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the business</COREF> to police <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> would be `` like *PRO* putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank . ''
<COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mr. Gargan</COREF> , <COREF ID="80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">Tampa</COREF> planner who *T*-1 heads <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">one trade group</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> favors *PRO* simply assessing <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> and giving the money to <COREF ID="76" TYPE="IDENT">the SEC</COREF> *PRO*-2 to hire more staff .
-LRB- <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gargan 's</COREF> views are not greeted *-1 with wild enthusiasm over at <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the IAFP</COREF> , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the major industry organization</COREF></COREF> .
When <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the IAFP</COREF> recently assembled other industry groups *PRO* to discuss common standards that *T*-3 might be applied *-1 to planners *T*-4 , <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gargan 's</COREF> group</COREF> was <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">excluded</COREF> *-2 .
<COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> may be because <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Gargan</COREF> , *PRO*-1 smarting at what <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> considered *T*-2 slurs on <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> membership standards made * by <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the rival group</COREF> , enrolled <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> dog</COREF> , <COREF ID="83" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Beauregard</COREF></COREF> , as a member of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the IAFP</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> sent <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the pooch 's</COREF> picture with <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the certificate of membership</COREF> -- <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was made *-1 out to `` <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Boris ` Bo ' Regaard</COREF> '' -- to every newspaper 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could think of *T*-2 . -RRB-
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">The states</COREF> have <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own ideas about regulation and certification .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">NASAA</COREF> , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the organization of state securities regulators</COREF> ,</COREF> is pushing for <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">a model regulatory statute already adopted * in eight states</COREF> .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> requires financial planners *PRO*-1 to register with states , pass competency tests and reveal to customers any conflicts of interest .
The most common conflict involves compensation .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">NASAA</COREF> estimates that <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">nearly 90 % of planners</COREF> receive some or all of <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> income from sales commissions on securities , insurance and other financial products 0 <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> recommend *T*-1 .
The issue : Is <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the planner</COREF> putting <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> clients into the best investments , or the ones that *T*-1 garner the biggest commissions ?
In <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">1986</COREF> <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> attorney general 's</COREF> office got an order *ICH*-1 from a state court in <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">Albany</COREF> shutting down <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">First Meridian Corp.</COREF> , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">Albany</COREF> financial - planning firm that *T*-4 had invested $ 55 million *U* on behalf of nearly 1,000 investors</COREF></COREF> .
In <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> notice of action , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the attorney general</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> had promised *PRO*-1 to put clients into `` balanced '' investment portfolios ; instead , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the attorney general</COREF> alleged 0 *?* , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> consistently shoved unwary customers into <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">high - risk investments in paintings , coins and Florida condos</COREF> .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">Those investments</COREF> <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">paid</COREF> big commissions *ICH*-3 to <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">First Meridian</COREF> , <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">payments 0 investors were never told *-2 about *T*-1</COREF> , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the attorney general</COREF> alleged 0 *T*-4 .
Investors were further assured *-1 that only those with a minimun net worth would be accepted *-2 .

<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">First Meridian</COREF> and <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> officials are currently under investigation for possible criminal wrongdoing , according to a spokeswoman for <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the attorney general</COREF> .

Civil suits against planners by clients seeking recovery of funds are increasingly common .
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Two such actions , both filed * earlier this year in Georgia state court in <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Atlanta</COREF> ,</COREF> could be particularly embarrassing to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> : <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">both</COREF> name <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="96" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">J.

<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Peterson</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the suits against <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF></COREF> are less a measure of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> work than <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are a `` sign of the times '' in which people generally are more prone *PRO* to sue *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know anybody in <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">the industry</COREF> who *T*-1 has n't experienced litigation , '' <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Peterson</COREF> also says 0 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't consider <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> a financial planner anymore .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> now calls <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *PRO*-1 an `` investment banker . ''
In many scams or alleged scams involving planners , it *EXP*-1 's plain that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">only a modicum of common sense on the part of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the investors</COREF></COREF> would have kept <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> out of harm 's way .
*PRO*-1 Using <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , would n't a proessional hesitate *PRO*-1 to pay tens of thousands of dollars just for a chance *PRO* to invest witha planner ?
Other cases go *PRO*-1 to show that an old saw still applies : If <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> sounds too good 0 *T*-2 to be true , <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> probably is *?* .
Certificates of deposit <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">do</COREF> n't pay 23 % a year , for example , but <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> did n't give pause to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">clients of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">one Alabama planner</COREF></COREF> .
Now <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're losers and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's in jail in Mobile County .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">CDs yielding 40 %</COREF> are even more implausible -- especially when the issuing `` bank '' in the Marshall Islands is merely a mail drop watched over * by a local gas - station operator *T*-1 -- but investors fell for <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">that one too</COREF> .
And the <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Colorado</COREF> planner who *T*-1 promised *PRO*-2 to make some of his clients millionaires on investments of as litle as $ 100 *U* ?
*PRO* Never mind .
You already know the answer .
