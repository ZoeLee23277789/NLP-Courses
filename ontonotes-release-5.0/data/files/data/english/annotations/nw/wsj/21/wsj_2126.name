Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John E. Sprizzo</ENAMEX> issued the order in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Manhattan</ENAMEX> federal court , where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> has accused the tiny company of illegally knocking off the `` <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">My First Sony</ENAMEX> '' line .

The legal fight was the subject of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wall Street Journal</ENAMEX> story <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justin</ENAMEX> 's attorney , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles E. Baxley</ENAMEX> , said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justin</ENAMEX> would ask an appeals court to set aside the order temporarily , pending an expedited appeal .

`` Their likelihood of reversing us is very slim , '' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis H. Eslinger</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Sony</ENAMEX> 's attorney , who said he doubts <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Justin</ENAMEX> will go ahead with a trial .
