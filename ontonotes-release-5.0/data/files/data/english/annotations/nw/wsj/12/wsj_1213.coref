After *PRO*-2 being whipsawed *-1 by <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">a volatile stock market</COREF> , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bonds closed higher .
But junk bonds took more hits .
Early in the day , bond dealers said 0 trading volume was heavy as large institutional investors scrambled *PRO*-1 to buy long - term <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bonds on speculation that <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market 's</COREF> volatility</COREF> would <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">lead</COREF> to a `` flight - to - quality '' rally .
<COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> happens when nervous stock investors dump equities and buy Treasurys , which *T*-1 are higher in quality and thus considered *PRO*-2 safe *T*-3 .
`` Some retail accounts , such as commercial banks and pension funds , wanted *PRO*-1 to get on the bandwagon before it was too late , '' said *T*-2 <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sung Won Sohn</COREF> , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief economist at Norwest Corp. , Minneapolis</COREF> .
At one point , <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the Dow Jones Industrial average</COREF> fell about 80 points on news that UAL Corp. decided *PRO*-1 to remain independent .
In response , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> prices soared <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">1 1/8 points , or about $ 11.25 *U* for each $ 1,000 *U* face amount</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">the gains in <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bonds</COREF> were pared *-1 as stocks staged a partial recovery .
<COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">The industrial average</COREF> ended at 2659.22 , down 3.69 points .
Economists said 0 <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the bond market 's</COREF> strength also is a sign that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">investors</COREF> expect <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Federal Reserve</COREF> to cut interest rates amid growing evidence that the economy is slowing .
While <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't expect <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the Fed</COREF> to move right away , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say 0 the case for lower rates is building .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">Yesterday</COREF> , for example , the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods fell 0.1 % , while <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the nation 's</COREF> auto makers reported lackluster mid-October sales .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">The Treasury 's</COREF> 30 - year bond ended over 1/4 point higher .
Municipal , mortgage - backed and investment - grade corporate bonds rose 1/8 to 1/2 point .
But high - yield , high - risk bonds fell 1/4 to 1/2 point with <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> early in the session and never recovered .
According to a trader at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , the hardest hit junk bonds were those issued * by <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">RJR Holdings Capital Corp.</COREF> , which *T*-1 are the easiest *PRO* to sell .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">RJR 's</COREF> 14.70 % bonds due 2007 fell 2 1/2 points .
Trading activity in <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the junk market</COREF> was extremely light as dealers could n't find enough buyers 0 *T*-1 to match sellers .
`` While <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> was <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">falling</COREF> , most -LCB- junk bond holders -RCB- were just watching <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-2 not knowing what *PRO*-3 to do *T*-1 , '' said *T*-4 <COREF ID="123" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Paul Suckow</COREF> , <COREF ID="123" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">director of fixed - income securities at Oppenheimer Management Corp</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="144" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was like *PRO* driving down the highway *PRO*-1 watching a wreck .
Everybody was rubber - necking . ''
Adding to <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">the junk market 's</COREF> jitters were *T*-3 reports that <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Donaldson , Lufkin -AMP- Jenrette Securities Corp.</COREF> is having trouble *-2 structuring <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">a $ 1.6 billion *U* offering for <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">TW Food Services Inc.</COREF></COREF> and will postpone *RNR*-1 or even cancel *RNR*-1 <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">TW</COREF> is the largest franchisee of <COREF ID="127" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hardee 's</COREF> , <COREF ID="127" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a fast - food restaurant</COREF> , and operates several other food chains .
<COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Donaldson Lufkin</COREF> would n't comment .
Credit analysts said 0 <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">investors</COREF> are nervous about <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> because <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> ability *PRO* to meet debt payments is dependent on too many variables , including the sale of assets and the need *PRO* to mortgage property *PRO*-1 to retire some existing debt .
Also , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">TW</COREF> offering</COREF> includes interest - deferred and *PRO* pay - in - kind securities , which *T*-1 are currently unpopular .
Meanwhile , investors turned a cold shoulder to <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury 's</COREF> sale of <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">$ 10 billion *U* of new two - year notes</COREF> <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">yesterday</COREF></COREF> .
`` It *EXP*-2 's not too surprising that <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the auction</COREF> was sloppy , *PRO* given <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the volatility in <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the bond market</COREF> because of stocks</COREF> , '' said *T*-1 <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Robert T. McGee</COREF> , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a senior vice president at Tokai Bank Ltd</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> are looking past supply to lower interest rates , but <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're also worried about *PRO*-2 being whipsawed *-1 by the volatility in <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">The new two - year notes</COREF> were priced *-1 with <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">an average yield of 7.74 %</COREF> .
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> was higher than the 7.71 % to 7.73 % average yield that traders had expected *T*-1 .
In when - issued trading , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the notes</COREF> were quoted *-1 at a price 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.78 % .
Sluggish demand was also evidenced *-1 by <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the weak 2.41 - to - 1 bid - to - cover ratio , which *T*-2 was lower than the average 2.79 - to - 1 ratio at the last 12 similar auctions</COREF> .
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">The ratio , which *T*-1 reflects the number of bids 0 <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury</COREF> receives *T*-2 for each bid accepted * ,</COREF> is used *-3 *PRO* to gauge investor demand .
Dealers said 0 <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">players</COREF> shied away from <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the note sale</COREF> because <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were concerned that prices at the time of <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the auction</COREF> might erode if <COREF ID="116" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> staged a recovery , which , in fact , *T*-1 did happen .
Individual and Japanese participation in <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">the auction</COREF> was disappointing , according to dealers .
`` Interest by <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Japanese investors</COREF> was limited , '' said *T*-2 <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Michael Moran</COREF> , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are typically not active in two - year note auctions , but today 's participation could be viewed *-1 as lighter - than - normal . ''
However , <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Moran</COREF> added that <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">the Japanese</COREF> generally have a positive view of <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. bond market</COREF> because of expectations that the dollar will remain strong and interest rates will decline .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said , `` Possibly , <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're waiting *PRO*-2 to buy at the -LRB- quarterly -RRB- refunding '' of government debt 0 *T*-3 to be held *-1 next month by <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the Treasury</COREF> .
A trader at a Japanese firm estimated that the Japanese purchased no more than 10 % of the two - year notes .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> , Agency Securities
Today investors will focus on the long - awaited auction of $ 4.5 billion *U* of 30 - year bonds by <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Resolution Funding Corp</COREF> .
The initial bond offering by <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the new government agency , which *T*-1 was created *-2 *PRO* to help rescue <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">the nation 's</COREF> troubled thrifts ,</COREF> is n't expected *-3 to see robust demand .
A small yield premium over comparable Treasurys and a lack of liquidity is hampering dealers ' efforts *PRO* to drum up interest in the so - called bailout bonds .
In when - issued trading , the <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Refcorp</COREF> bonds were quoted *-1 at a price 0 *T*-2 to yield 8.17 % .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">Yesterday</COREF> , the benchmark 30 - year bond was quoted *-1 late at 102 18/32 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.89 % , compared with 102 9/32 0 *T*-3 to yield 7.93 % on <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Monday</COREF> .
The latest 10 - year Treasury was quoted *-1 at 100 22/32 0 *T*-2 to yield 7.88 % , compared with 100 17/32 0 *T*-3 to yield 7.9 % .
Short - term rates were unchanged to slightly lower .
The discount rate on three - month <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bills was quoted *-1 at 7.52 % for a bond - equivalent yield of 7.75 % , while the rate on six - month <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">Treasury</COREF> bills was quoted *-2 at 7.47 % for a yield of 7.85 % .
Rates are determined *-1 by the difference between the purchase price and face value .
Thus , higher bidding narrows <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the investor 's return</COREF> while lower bidding widens <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .

Meanwhile , <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">International Business Machines Corp.</COREF> paved the way for a visit to the credit markets by *PRO*-1 filing <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">a shelf registration</COREF> *ICH*-2 with the Securities and Exchange Commission for $ 800 million *U* in new debt .
<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is in addition to <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">IBM 's</COREF> existing shelf registration under which $ 200 million *U* in debt securities are available for issuance *T*-1 .
