When <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rune Andersson</ENAMEX> set out to revive flagging <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swedish</ENAMEX> conglomerate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg AB</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the early 1980s</ENAMEX> , he spurned the advice of trendy management consultants .
`` All these consultants kept coming around telling us we should concentrate on high technology , electronics or biotechnology , and get out of mature basic industries , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> recalls .
Yet under its <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">45 - year - old</ENAMEX> president , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> moved aggressively into those unfashionable base industries -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> strengthening its existing rubber and plastics division , later adding mining as well as building and construction materials .
It was a gutsy move for a little - known executive , fired after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">only two months</ENAMEX> as president of his previous company .
But going against the grain has never bothered Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> .
Stroking his trademark white goatee during a recent interview , the diminutive <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swede</ENAMEX> quips : `` It turned out to be lucky for us .
If the whole market thinks what you 're doing is crazy you do n't have much competition . ''
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> is anxious to strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's balance sheet .
Characteristically , he did n't waste much time getting started .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg 's</ENAMEX> directors announced plans to spin off <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> big divisions -- minerals processing , and building and distribution -- as separately quoted companies on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Stockholm 's Stock Exchange</ENAMEX> .
At current market prices , the twin public offerings to be completed <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> would add <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">an estimated 2.5 billion Swedish kronor</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 386 million</ENAMEX> -RRB- to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's coffers , analysts say .
The board had also been expected to approve a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr1.5 billion</ENAMEX> international offering of new <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> shares .
But that share issue -- intended to make <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> better known among international investors -- was postponed until market conditions stabilize , people familiar with the situation say .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's internationally traded `` Bfree '' series stock plunged <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr29</ENAMEX> -LRB- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">4.48</ENAMEX> -RRB- to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr205</ENAMEX> -LRB- $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">31.65</ENAMEX> -RRB- in volatile trading <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Stockholm</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</ENAMEX> , the shares regained <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr20</ENAMEX> , closing at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">SKr225</ENAMEX> .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> says he is confident that taking parts of the company public will help erase the `` conglomerate stigma '' that has held down <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's share price .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> plans to remain the dominant shareholder with stakes of slightly <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">less than 50 %</ENAMEX> of both units .
The spinoff should solve a problem for the parent .
A family foundation set up by late founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry Dunker</ENAMEX> controls <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's voting shares outstanding .
But the foundation bylaws require the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> stake to be sold in the open market if control drops <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">below 50 %</ENAMEX> .
That possibility had crept closer as repeated new share offerings to finance <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's rapid growth steadily diluted the foundation 's holding .
That growth is the result of Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> 's shopping spree , during which he has bought and sold <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 100</ENAMEX> companies during <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past five years</ENAMEX> .
Most of the new additions were barely profitable , if not outright loss makers .
Applying prowess gained during earlier stints at appliance maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">AB Electrolux</ENAMEX> , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> and a handful of loyal lieutenants aggressively stripped away dead wood -- and got quick results .
The treatment turned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> into one of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Scandinavia</ENAMEX> 's biggest and fastest - growing industrial concerns .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1985 and 1988</ENAMEX> , sales multipled <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">more than 10</ENAMEX> times and pretax profit surged almost twelvefold .
Many analysts expect Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> , who owns <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1.7 %</ENAMEX> of the company , to be named <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's new chairman when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ernst Herslow</ENAMEX> steps down <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> .
But the promotion is n't likely to alter a management style Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> describes as `` being the driving force leading the troops , not managing by sitting back with a cigar waiting for people to bring me ideas . ''
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</ENAMEX> , in his boldest move yet , Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> joined forces with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Canada</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Noranda Inc.</ENAMEX> in a joint <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 2 billion</ENAMEX> hostile takeover of another big <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Canadian</ENAMEX> mining concern , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Falconbridge Ltd</ENAMEX> .
Industry analysts suggest that the conquest of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> could vault <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> from a regional <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Scandinavian</ENAMEX> success story to a world - class mining concern .
`` <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> is n't in the same league yet as mining giants such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">RTZ Corp.</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Anglo - American Corp.</ENAMEX> , '' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Kurtanjek</ENAMEX> , a mining analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">James Capel -AMP- Co.</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">London</ENAMEX> .
`` But we certainly like what we 've seen so far . ''
But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> still must clear some tough hurdles .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> acknowledges that the company 's mining division `` will be busy for a while digesting its recent expansion . ''
Booming metals prices have fueled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's recent profit surge , raising mining 's share of pretax profit to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">68 %</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</ENAMEX> from a big loss <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">two years earlier</ENAMEX> .
But analysts caution an expected fall in metal prices <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">next year</ENAMEX> could slow profit growth .
Mining is likely to remain <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's main business .
Analysts say its chances of success will likely hinge on how well <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> manages to cooperate with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Noranda</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> venture .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Noranda</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> each came close to winning <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> alone before the successful joint bid .
Some analysts say <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Noranda</ENAMEX> would prefer to break up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> , and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Swedes</ENAMEX> -- relatively inexperienced in international mining operations -- could have problems holding their own with a much bigger partner like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Noranda</ENAMEX> operating on its home turf .
Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> insists that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Noranda</ENAMEX> have n't discussed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> break - up .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Falconbridge</ENAMEX> , he says , will continue operating in its current form .
`` We 'd be reluctant to accept <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">50 - 50</ENAMEX> ownership in a manufacturing company .
But such partnerships are common in mining , where there are n't problems or conflict of interest or risk of cheating by a partner , '' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> 's president says .
Perhaps more important , both companies share Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> 's belief in the coming renaissance of base industries .
`` If <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 1980s</ENAMEX> were <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade</ENAMEX> of consumption , the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">'90s</ENAMEX> will be <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the investment decade</ENAMEX> , '' Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andersson</ENAMEX> says .
`` The whole of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and the industrialized world is suffering from a breakdown in infrastructure investment , '' he says .
`` That 's beginning to change .
And investment is the key word for base metals , and most other businesses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Trelleborg</ENAMEX> is in .
