At age eight , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Josephine Baker</COREF> was sent *-1 by <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mother to a white woman 's house *PRO*-2 to do chores in exchange for meals and <COREF ID="84" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a place 0 *PRO* to sleep *T*-3</COREF> -- <COREF ID="84" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a place in the basement with the coal</COREF> .
At age 19 , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was a <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Paris</COREF> sensation , *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">transformed</COREF> * from unwanted child to international sex symbol in just over a decade .
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is the stuff of dreams , but also of traumas .
Only the bravest spirits survive such roller coasters .
And , for <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Baker</COREF> , the ride was far from over .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> bare breasts , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> dancing</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> voice , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> beauty and , perhaps most famously , <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> derriere</COREF> , were prominent attractions , but courage of a rare sort made <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> remarkable life</COREF> possible .
<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="87" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Bricktop</COREF> , <COREF ID="87" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">another American black woman who *T*-1 found a measure of fame in <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Paris</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> said : `` <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've ever known anyone with a less complicated view of life , or whose life *T*-2 was more complicated than <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Josephine 's</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Men</COREF> were a constant complication .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> had lots of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> did n't trust <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and did n't reward trust .
As <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> saw one key love affair , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the problem</COREF> was n't <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> infidelity , <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was his jealousy .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> appetite for children also was large .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> adopted <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">12 of assorted races</COREF> , *PRO*-1 naming <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-4 the Rainbow Tribe , and driving <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband first to despair and then to Argentina .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> made money , but spent more .
Friends pitched in .
Finally , Prince Rainier and Princess Grace saved <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> with the offer of a house in Monaco .
Another lifelong complication , as <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Phyllis Rose</COREF> makes *?* clear in <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">`` Jazz Cleopatra : Josephine Baker in Her Time '' -LRB- Doubleday , 321 pages , $ 22.50 *U* -RRB-</COREF> , was racism .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> had the good luck *PRO* to arrive in <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">1925 Paris , where blacks had become exotic *T*-1</COREF> .
African art was in vogue and some intellectuals were writing breathlessly of a dawning age 0 *T*-2 to be inspired *-1 by blacks .
*PRO* To be exotic was *PRO* to be patronized as well as prized *-1 , but for the most part <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Paris</COREF> was a friendly island in a racist world .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> had bitter experience of bigotry from <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> St. Louis childhood and <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> days in New York theater , where <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was judged *-1 too dark for an all - black chorus line -LRB- performing of course for all - white audiences -RRB- *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Paris</COREF> loved <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> at first sight .
`` <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> just wiggled <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> fanny</COREF> and all the French fell in love with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> , '' sniffed *T*-1 the literary world 's Maria Jolas , not entirely inaccurately .
`` One can hardly overemphasize the importance of <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> rear end</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Rose</COREF> writes *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Rose , who *T*-1 teaches literature at Wesleyan University ,</COREF> quickly proceeds *PRO*-2 to overemphasize , *PRO*-2 claiming that <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker 's</COREF> dancing</COREF> `` had uncovered a new region for desire '' and thereby ignoring centuries of tributes to the callipygous .
`` <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">Jazz Cleopatra</COREF> '' contains other , more important , false notes that *T*-1 undermine what *T*-2 is , for the most part , a lively account of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">a life already familiar from earlier works</COREF> .
It *EXP*-2 is easy *PRO* to see why <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Baker</COREF> , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a free spirit who *T*-1 broke many of the restraints 0 convention places *T*-3 on women</COREF> ,</COREF> attracts <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ms. Rose</COREF> , <COREF ID="91" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the author of `` <COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Parallel Lives</COREF> , '' <COREF ID="93" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a wonderful study of Victorian marriage</COREF></COREF></COREF> *T*-4 .
Still , even the title raises questions about <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the author 's</COREF> vision of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> subject</COREF> .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker 's</COREF> art was jazz only by the widest stretch of the term .
*PRO* To find parallels , other than sexual appeal , with Cleopatra , requires an equal stretch .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> was 68 years old when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">died</COREF> in <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Paris</COREF> *T*-2 , two days after the sold - out opening of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> newest show : <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">a movie - like ending to what *T*-1 was <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">a cinematic life</COREF></COREF> .
In fact , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Baker</COREF> played scenes *ICH*-2 in <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Casablanca</COREF> that *T*-1 could have made it into `` Casablanca . ''
During <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">World War II</COREF> , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> uncomplicated view of life led <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> to <COREF ID="97" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the conclusion that <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the Nazis</COREF> were evil and must be resisted *-1</COREF> , <COREF ID="97" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a decision made * by only about 2 % of French citizens</COREF> .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> was devoted to Charles de Gaulle 's cause , *PRO*-1 accepting great financial sacrifice and considerable risk *PRO*-2 to become first a spy and then a one - woman USO tour for the forces of <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Free France</COREF> .
In Humphrey Bogart 's nightclub , Victor Laszlo leads Free French sympathizers in `` La Marseillaise '' *PRO*-1 to drown out <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the Nazis</COREF> .
The night 0 the Germans occupied all of <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> performed in <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">Casablanca</COREF> .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">The Free French</COREF> wore black arm bands , and when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> sang `` J'ai deux amours '' *T*-1 <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wept .
<COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Rose</COREF> is best on the early years and <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">World War II</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> introduction , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Rose</COREF> writes that <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> feels 0 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> has much in common with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> , but as <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">`` Jazz Cleopatra ''</COREF> goes on , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> seems *-1 more rushed , as though <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">the author</COREF> were growing less interested .
It does n't help that sometimes <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Rose 's</COREF> language fails *-1 to deliver the effect 0 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> appears *-3 to want *T*-2 .
One chapter opens : `` <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">World War II</COREF> was not one of <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">France 's</COREF> glorious moments . ''
Elsewhere , in an attempt *PRO* to explain without *PRO*-2 stating <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> plainly *PPA*-5 that <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">had</COREF> a large gay following later in <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> career when <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was an overdressed singer rather than underdressed dancer *T*-3 , <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Rose</COREF> writes : `` <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> was a female impersonator who *T*-1 happened *-4 to be a woman . ''
One devoted fan who *T*-1 fell under <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker 's</COREF> spell in 1963 and began *-2 collecting <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> memorabilia was <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Bryan Hammond</COREF> .
In `` Josephine Baker '' -LRB- Jonathan Cape , 304 pages , $ 35 *U* -RRB- , which *T*-1 was published *-2 in Britain last year and distributed *-2 in the U.S. this month , <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Hammond</COREF> has used <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> collection *PRO*-3 to produce an album of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">photographs and drawings of <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">the star</COREF></COREF> .
The text by Patrick O'Connor is a tough read , but <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the pictures</COREF> make <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> magnetism clear and help *PRO* explain why Ernest Hemingway called <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Baker</COREF> *PRO*-4 `` The most sensational woman 0 anybody ever saw *T*-2 *T*-3 .
Or ever will . ''
