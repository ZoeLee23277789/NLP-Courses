In terms of sheer brutality , <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the Somali regime of <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Siad Barre</COREF></COREF> may rank as No. 1 in <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> .
The only reason that <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Somalia</COREF> remains in obscurity is numbers : a sparsely populated wasteland of 8.5 million people spread * out over an expanse nearly the size of Texas .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">The <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Barre</COREF> dictatorship</COREF> simply is limited in the amount of people 0 <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can torture and kill *T*-1 .
*PRO* Beheading small children , stabbing elderly people to death , raping and shooting women , and burying people alive are just a few of the grisly activities that <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">the Somali armed forces</COREF> have been engaged *-2 in *T*-3 over the past two years .
Up to 500,000 Somalis have escaped to the relative safety of <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Marxist Ethiopia</COREF> because of the behavior of <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">President Barre 's</COREF> troops</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the port of Berbera</COREF> , for example , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">hundreds of men of the rival Issak clan</COREF> were rounded *-2 up in May 1988 , imprisoned *-2 , and then taken out at night in groups of five to 50 men *PRO*-2 to be executed *-1 without any judicial process whatsoever .
Guns were never used *-1 : <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">Each man</COREF> was stabbed *-2 to death with a large knife .
The horrific details are only now emerging from a painstakingly documented report , based on hundreds of interviews with randomly selected refugees .
The study was done *-1 by <COREF ID="114" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Robert Gersony</COREF> , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a consultant to the U.S. State Department who *T*-2 has years of experience in *PRO* investigating human - rights abuses on both sides of the left - right ideological divide</COREF> .
What *T*-1 gives <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">these events</COREF> particular significance , however , is the fact that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are part of a wider drama affecting the strategic positions of both <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> and the Soviet Union on <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the horn of <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">Africa</COREF></COREF> .
Not since <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the late 1970s</COREF> has <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the horn</COREF> been so up for grabs as <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has suddenly become in just the past few weeks *?* .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Barre 's</COREF> rule</COREF> is crumbling fast .
Mutinies wrack <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="124" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> armed forces</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="124" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">really just an armed gang</COREF> -RRB- , which *T*-1 control less than half the country</COREF> .
Inflation is at record levels .
*PRO*-2 Desperate , <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has called in the Libyans *PRO*-3 to help *PRO* fight the rebels of the Somali National Movement in the north , which *T*-1 is only one of several groups picking away at <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the regime</COREF> in the capital of Mogadishu .
*PRO*-2 Seventy years old and <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">a self - declared `` scientific socialist , ''</COREF> <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">President Barre</COREF> has a power base , composed * only of <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> minority Mareham clan , that according to observers *T*-1 is `` narrowing . ''
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S. 's</COREF> interest in <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Somalia</COREF> consists of <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">a single runway at <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the port of Berbera</COREF> , which U.S. military aircraft have the right *PRO*-2 to use *T*-1 for surveillance of the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean</COREF> .
<COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">That strip of concrete</COREF> is backed *-1 up by a few one - story , air - conditioned shacks where <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">a handful</COREF> of American nationals -- buttressed * by imported food , cold soft drinks and back issues of Sports Illustrated --</COREF> maintain radio contact with the outside world *T*-2 .
In the past two years , the desert behind <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> has become a land of mass executions and utter anarchy , where , due to <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Barre 's</COREF> brutality and ineptitude , nobody is any longer in control *T*-1 .
As long as the rival Soviet - backed regime of <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Mengistu Haile Mariam</COREF> held a total gridlock over <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">neighboring Ethiopia</COREF> , <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> was forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to accept <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">that lonely <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">Berbera</COREF> runway</COREF> as a distant No. 2 to <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">the Soviets ' array of airfields next door</COREF> .
But due to dramatic events on the battlefield over the past few days and weeks , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">those Soviet bases</COREF> may soon be as endangered and as lonely as <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">the American runway</COREF> .
On Sept. 7 , <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wrote on these pages about the killing and capturing of 10,000 Ethiopian soldiers by Eritrean and Tigrean guerrillas .
Recently , in Wollo province in the center of <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Ethiopia</COREF> , Tigrean forces have killed , wounded and captured an additional 20,000 government troops .
-LRB- *PRO* Think what these numbers mean *T*-1 -- considering the headline space devoted * to hundreds of deaths in <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lebanon</COREF> , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a small country of little strategic importance</COREF> ! -RRB-
<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">Tigrean armies</COREF> are now 200 miles north of <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Addis Ababa</COREF> , *PRO*-3 threatening <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the town of Dese</COREF> , which *T*-1 would cut off <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mengistu 's</COREF> capital</COREF> from the port of Assab , through which all fuel and other supplies reach <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">Addis Ababa</COREF> *T*-2 .
As a result , <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mengistu</COREF> has been forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to transfer thousands of troops from <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Eritrea</COREF> just *PRO* to hold <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">the town</COREF> , *PRO* thereby risking the loss of even more territory in <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">Eritrea</COREF> only *PRO* to keep <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the Tigreans</COREF> at bay .
<COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mengistu</COREF> is in an increasingly weak position : Half <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> army is tied *-1 down *PRO*-1 defending the northern city of Asmara from the Eritreans .
The weaker <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets , the more <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> turns toward <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> for help .
While <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the Tigreans</COREF> are communists , like the Eritreans <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are among the most anti-Soviet guerrillas in <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> , *PRO*-1 having suffered more than a decade of aerial bombardment by the Soviet - supplied <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Mengistu</COREF> air force .
What this all means *T*-1 in shorthand is that Soviet dominance in <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Ethiopia</COREF> is collapsing as fast as <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">President Barre 's</COREF> regime in <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Somalia</COREF> is *?* .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> , therefore , has a historic opportunity *PRO* both to strike a blow for human rights in <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Somalia</COREF> and to undo the superpower flip - flop of <COREF ID="128" TYPE="IDENT">the late 1970s</COREF> on <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the Horn of <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">Africa</COREF></COREF> .
Back to <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Somalia</COREF> :
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">The State Department</COREF> , to <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> credit , has already begun *-2 distancing <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> from <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Barre</COREF> , *PRO* evinced * by <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> decision *PRO* to publish the Gersony report -LRB- which the press has ignored *T*-1 -RRB- .
What *T*-1 's more , <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> has suspended $ 2.5 million *U* in military aid and $ 1 million *U* in economic aid .
But this is not enough .
Because <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> is still perceived *-3 to be tied *-1 to <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Barre</COREF> , when <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> goes *T*-2 <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the runway</COREF> could go too .
Considering how tenuous the security of <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">that runway</COREF> is anyway *T*-1 , the better option -- both morally and strategically -- would be for the Bush administration to blast <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the regime</COREF> publicly , in terms clear enough for all influential Somalis *PRO* to understand .
It *EXP*-2 is a certainty that <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Barre 's</COREF> days are numbered *-1 .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> should take care , however , that <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own position in <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> does not go down with <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
Nobody is sure what *T*-1 will come next in <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Somalia</COREF> or whom <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the successor</COREF> might be *T*-2 .
But as one expert tells <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> : `` Whoever <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-1 will have *-2 to work pretty damn hard *PRO*-3 to be worse than <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Barre</COREF> . ''
While <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">the State Department</COREF> positions <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> for the <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">post-Barre</COREF> period in <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">Somalia</COREF> , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should continue *-1 to back former President Carter 's well - intentioned role as a mediator between <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mengistu</COREF> and the Eritrean guerrillas in <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Ethiopia</COREF> , while *PRO* concomitantly opening up channels of communications with the Tigrean rebels through neighboring Sudan .
Ethiopian politics are the most sophisticated , secretive and Byzantine in all of black Africa .
*PRO* Remember that it *EXP*-2 took <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Mengistu</COREF> many months , in what *T*-1 became known as the `` creeping coup , '' *PRO*-3 to topple Emperor Haile Selassie in 1974 and 1975 .
There is simply no way *PRO* to engineer a succession covertly , as *PRO* is sometimes possible elsewhere on <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the continent</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> has one great advantage : <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The Soviets</COREF> are universally loathed *-1 throughout <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Ethiopia</COREF> for what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did *T*-2 to <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> this past decade -- famine and all .
It 's not just in Eastern Europe *ICH*-2 where the march of events is finally on the U.S. side *T*-1 , but on <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the horn of <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">Africa</COREF></COREF> as well .
The only U.S. liability in <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the region</COREF> is what *T*-2 remains of the link to <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Barre</COREF> , and that should be cut *-1 fast .
