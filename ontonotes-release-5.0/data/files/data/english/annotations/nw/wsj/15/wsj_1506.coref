<COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">The U.S.</COREF> is <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">required</COREF> *-1 *PRO*-3 to notify <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">foreign dictators</COREF> if <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> knows of coup plans likely *PRO* to endanger <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives , government officials said 0 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">The notification policy</COREF> was part of <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">a set of guidelines on *PRO* handling coups outlined * in a secret 1988 exchange of <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">letters</COREF> between <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration</COREF> and <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate Intelligence Committee</COREF></COREF> .
The existence of <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the guidelines</COREF> has become known *-1 since <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">President Bush</COREF> disclosed <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> privately to <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">seven Republican senators</COREF> at <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">a <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">White House</COREF> meeting</COREF> last Monday .
<COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">Officials familiar with <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the meeting</COREF></COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> cited <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the policy</COREF> as an example of the sort of congressional requirements 0 <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> contends 0 *T*-1 contribute to the failure of such covert actions as <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">this month 's</COREF> futile effort *PRO* to oust <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega</COREF></COREF> .
According to <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">the officials</COREF> , <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> even read to <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the senators</COREF> <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">selections from a highly classified letter from <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> to <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> discussing <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the guidelines</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> conceded 0 <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the notification requirement</COREF> did n't affect <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> decision *PRO* to lend only minor support to <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">this month 's</COREF> <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> coup effort</COREF> .
No notification was ever considered *-1 , officials said 0 *?* , apparently because <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> did n't think 0 the coup plotters intended *PRO*-3 to kill <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF> , but merely sought *PRO*-3 to imprison <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
What 's more , both administration and congressional officials hint that <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the notification requirement</COREF> is likely *-3 to be dropped *-1 from <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the guidelines on coup attempts that *T*-4 are being <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">rewritten</COREF> *-2 by <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the panel</COREF> and <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">The rewriting</COREF> was launched *-1 at <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">a meeting between <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Bush</COREF> and intelligence committee leaders</COREF> <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Oct. 12 , a few days before <COREF ID="83" TYPE="IDENT">the meeting at which <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> complained about <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the rules</COREF> *T*-2</COREF></COREF> .
However , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the disclosure of <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">the guidelines</COREF> , first reported * last night by NBC News ,</COREF> is already being interpreted *-1 on Capitol Hill as an unfair effort *PRO* to pressure <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has reopened the bitter wrangling between <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> and <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF></COREF> over who *T*-1 is responsible for <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the failure *PRO* to oust <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Noriega</COREF></COREF> and , more broadly , for difficulties in *PRO* carrying out covert activities abroad .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">A statement issued * by the office of <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="94" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the committee chairman</COREF> , <COREF ID="94" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sen. David Boren</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="94" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">D.</COREF> , Okla. -RRB- ,</COREF></COREF> charged that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the disclosure</COREF> is part of a continuing effort *PRO* to shift the criticism for <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the failure of <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the recent coup attempt in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">The statement</COREF> added , `` <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">Someone</COREF> has regrettably chosen *PRO*-1 to selectively <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">summarize</COREF> <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">portions of highly classified correspondence between <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">the two branches of government</COREF></COREF> .
Not only does <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> come close to a violation of law , <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> violates the trust 0 <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have all worked *PRO*-1 to develop *T*-2 . ''
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Boren</COREF> said , `` It 's time 0 *PRO* to stop bickering and work together *PRO*-1 to develop a clear and appropriate policy 0 *PRO* to help <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> in the future *T*-3 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've invited <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF> *PRO*-1 to send <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> suggestions to <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine</COREF> , <COREF ID="101" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the panel 's</COREF> vice chairman</COREF> ,</COREF> said of <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">the disclosure</COREF> that `` a text torn * out of context is a pretext , and it *EXP*-2 is unfair for those in <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> who *T*-1 are leaking to present the evidence in a selective fashion . ''
<COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Sen. Boren</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the committee</COREF> could n't defend <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> by *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">making</COREF> <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the documents</COREF> public because <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would violate classification rules .
But <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the chairman</COREF> and other committee members stressed that <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the notification guideline</COREF> was n't imposed *-1 on <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> by <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">a meddling Congress</COREF> .
Instead , both congressional and administration officials agreed 0 *?* , <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> grew out of talks about coup - planning in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> that *T*-1 were initiated *-3 by <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> in July 1988 and stretched into last October .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">The guideline</COREF> was n't a law , but a joint interpretation of how <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> might operate during foreign coups in light of <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the longstanding presidential order banning a U.S. role in assassinations</COREF> *T*-1 .
In fact , yesterday <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the administration</COREF> and <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF></COREF> were still differing on what *T*-1 had been agreed to *-2 .
One administration official said 0 notification was <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">required</COREF> *-1 even if <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> `` gets wind '' of somebody else 's coup plans that *T*-2 seem likely *PRO*-3 to endanger a dictator 's life .
But a congressional source close to <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">the panel</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the rule</COREF> only covered coup plans directly involving <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> .
Although <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the notification guideline</COREF> was n't carried *-1 out in <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">this month 's</COREF> coup attempt , some administration officials argue that <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> may have led to hesitation and uncertainty on the part of U.S. intelligence and military operatives in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> .
One senior administration official called <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the guideline</COREF> *PRO*-2 `` outrageous '' and said 0 <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could make <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">U.S. operatives</COREF> reluctant *PRO*-1 to even listen to coup plans for fear 0 <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may get into legal trouble .
The issue came to a head last year , officials recalled 0 *?* , partly because <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">Reagan</COREF> administration</COREF> had sought unsuccessfully *PRO*-2 to win committee approval of funding for new <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF> coup efforts .
In addition , both administration and congressional officials said 0 the need for guidelines on coups and assassinations was partly spurred *-1 by a <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">White House</COREF> desire *PRO* to avoid nasty overseas surprises during the election campaign .
Though <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the assassination ban</COREF> is a White House order that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> never voted on *T*-1 , the intelligence committees can exercise influence over <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> interpretation .
Last week , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">Central Intelligence Agency</COREF> Director William Webster</COREF> publicly called on <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> to provide new interpretations of <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the assassination order</COREF> that *T*-1 would permit <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> more freedom *PRO* to act in coups .
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">The administration</COREF> has reacted to criticism that <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> mishandled <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the latest coup attempt</COREF> by *PRO*-1 seeking *PRO*-2 to blame <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Congress</COREF> for restrictions 0 <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the White House</COREF> said 0 *T*-3 have hampered <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> freedom of action .
However , last week <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Webster 's</COREF> two top <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">CIA</COREF> deputies said 0 congressional curbs had n't hampered <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">the spy agency 's</COREF> role in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the coup attempt in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Panama</COREF></COREF> .
Nevertheless , <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the administration 's</COREF> criticisms appeared *-1 to have made some headway with <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">Sens. <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">Boren</COREF> and <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">Cohen</COREF></COREF> after <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">Oct. 12</COREF> meeting with <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the president</COREF></COREF> .
The three men agreed *PRO*-2 to rewrite the guidelines , without *PRO*-3 changing <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">the basic assassination ban</COREF> , *PRO*-3 to clear up any ambiguities that *T*-1 may have hampered U.S. encouragement of coups against anti-American leaders .
The new argument over <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">the notification guideline</COREF> , however , could sour any atmosphere of cooperation that *T*-1 existed .
