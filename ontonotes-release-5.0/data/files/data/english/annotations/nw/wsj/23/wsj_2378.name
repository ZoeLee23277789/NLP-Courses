It was <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday the 13th</ENAMEX> , and the stock market plummeted <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 200</ENAMEX> points .
Just a coincidence ?
Or is triskaidekaphobia -- fear of the number <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13</ENAMEX> -- justified ?
In academia , a so - called <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday the 13th</ENAMEX> effect has been set up and shot down by different professors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kolb</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ricardo Rodriguez</ENAMEX> , professors of finance at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the University of Miami</ENAMEX> , found evidence that the market is spooked by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday the 13th</ENAMEX> .
But their study , which spanned the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1962 - 85</ENAMEX> period , has since been shown to be jinxed by an unlucky choice of data .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the '70s</ENAMEX> , the market took falls <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nine</ENAMEX> times in a row on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday the you - know - what</ENAMEX> .
But the date tends to be a plus , not a minus , for stocks , according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yale Hirsch</ENAMEX> , a collector of stock market lore .
Another study found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">82</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays the 13th</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1940 - 1987</ENAMEX> period had higher than average returns -- higher even than <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Fridays</ENAMEX> in general , which tend to be strong <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">days</ENAMEX> for stock prices .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the only other Friday the 13th this year</ENAMEX> , the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">about four</ENAMEX> points .
Professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kolb</ENAMEX> says the original study , titled <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Friday the 13th , Part VII</ENAMEX> , was published tongue - in - cheek .
In a similar vein , he adds that the anniversary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</ENAMEX> crash and <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</ENAMEX> 's full moon could have played a part , too , in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> 's market activity .
