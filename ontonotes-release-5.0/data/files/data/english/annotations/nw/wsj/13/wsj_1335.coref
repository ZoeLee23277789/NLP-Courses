<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">The dollar</COREF> weakened in indecisive trading as <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">foreign - exchange dealers</COREF> awaited fresh economic news that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> hope 0 *T*-1 will jolt <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. unit</COREF> out of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> narrow ranges .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">The Canadian dollar</COREF> climbed to <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> highest level against <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. dollar</COREF> since late August , *PRO* prompting the Bank of Canada *PRO*-1 to sell <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">the Canadian currency</COREF> on <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Traders</COREF> say that after a week of *PRO* nervously tracking every development on Wall Street , <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the foreign - exchange market</COREF> has settled back *PRO*-1 to catch <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> breath ahead of new U.S. economic data .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> noted , however , that a 26 - point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average gave <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> a sharp nudge downward late in the day .
In late <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> trading yesterday , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the dollar</COREF> was quoted *-1 at 1.8470 marks , down from 1.8578 marks <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">late Friday</COREF> , and at 141.90 yen , down from 142.43 yen <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">late Friday</COREF> .
Sterling was quoted *-1 at $ 1.6030 *U* , up from $ 1.5885 *U* <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">late Friday</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Tuesday</COREF> , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. currency</COREF> opened for trading at 141.80 yen , down from Monday 's <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> close of 142.40 yen .
<COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">The market 's</COREF> attention is especially focused *-1 on <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">a preliminary report on the U.S. third - quarter gross national product , due out Thursday , which *T*-2 could show 0 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> is continuing *-3 to expand at a relatively brisk pace</COREF> .
The consensus view on <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">real GNP</COREF> , <COREF ID="58" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the total value of the U.S. output of goods and services adjusted * for inflation</COREF> , calls for a 2.3 % gain on an annual basis , slowing somewhat from <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the second quarter 's</COREF> 2.5 % , but still fairly strong .
Few market participants expect <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. unit</COREF> to rally sharply on <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the news</COREF> , if <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> turns out as *PRO*-1 expected *-2 .
Many contend that <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the report</COREF> may overstate <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the economy 's</COREF> health and predict 0 <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the third - quarter figures</COREF> may be the last vigorous statistics for some time 0 *T*-1 to come .
`` Everyone is waiting for GNP , '' says *T*-1 <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Walter Simon</COREF> , <COREF ID="60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an assistant treasurer with Bank Julius Baer -AMP- Co</COREF> .
`` Yet <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">even a relatively strong number</COREF> -- <COREF ID="61" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">2.8 % to 2.9 %</COREF> *U* --</COREF> wo n't alter <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the market 's</COREF> view that <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> is softening . ''
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Hubert Pedroli</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">managing director of foreign exchange at Credit Suisse in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF></COREF> ,</COREF> adds , `` <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">The market</COREF> sees <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> as the last piece of good news . ''
<COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">Mr. Pedroli</COREF> notes that <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the GNP deflator</COREF> , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a measure of inflation</COREF> ,</COREF> is expected *-1 to slow , which *T*-2 would give the Federal Reserve more room 0 *PRO* to ease key U.S. rates *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Analysts</COREF> predict a 3.5 % rise in <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the deflator</COREF> , after *PRO* climbing 4.6 % in <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the second quarter</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> note that when an unexpectedly sharp widening in the U.S. trade gap in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">August</COREF> was reported *-2 earlier this month *T*-4 , hopes for a sustained narrowing of the trade deficit were dashed *-3 and sentiment *ICH*-1 gripped <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> that <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. economy</COREF> was losing <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> momentum .
A 190 - point plunge in U.S. stock shares compounded the view , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say 0 *T*-1 .
`` Everyone is extremely convinced 0 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> is slowing , '' says *T*-1 one senior <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> dealer .
`` If <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're not headed for a recession , <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're certainly headed for a major slowdown . ''
While <COREF ID="54" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> expects little reaction from news of U.S. durable goods orders , scheduled * for release today , participants note that <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the figures</COREF> will probably serve *PRO*-1 to reinforce this bearish sentiment .
U.S. durable goods orders are expected *-1 to show <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">a decline of 1.2 % in September</COREF> , according to economists .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">The anticipated drop</COREF> follows a 3.9 % rise in <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">August</COREF> .
Traders , however , are quick *PRO*-1 to point out that while there is little enthusiasm for *PRO* buying dollars , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. unit</COREF> has found a `` natural bottom '' at about 1.85 marks and 140 yen .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> resilience around these levels is pegged *-1 to persistent investor demand for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the greenback</COREF> , especially in Japan .
On the Commodity Exchange in <COREF ID="55" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> , gold for current delivery settled at $ 367 *U* an ounce , down 30 cents .
Estimated volume was a very light one million ounces .
In early trading in Hong Kong <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">Tuesday</COREF> , gold was quoted *-1 at $ 366.79 *U* an ounce .
