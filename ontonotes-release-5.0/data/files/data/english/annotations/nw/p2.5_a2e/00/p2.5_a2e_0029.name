<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The Arab Water Council</ENAMEX> is currently looking into the provision of financial funding in order to update studies relating to the financial situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries and to prepare regular reports on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> water situation and the recommendations needed to face future crises linked to water security .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Cairo</ENAMEX> was host to <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the 3rd Regional Arab Water Conference</ENAMEX> last week , attended by irrigation ministers , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud Abu Zaid</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Latif Rasheed</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Moroccan</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdulkarim Zahoud</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sudanese</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Joakok</ENAMEX> , as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">350</ENAMEX> experts from <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">22</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> and foreign countries , in the course of which they warned of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries ' increasing reliance on imported food .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Zaid</ENAMEX> asserted that the time has come to rely on non-governmental organizations and civil society associations to provide suitable conditions to face the challenge of water scarcity and pointed out that one of the priorities of the work of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Arab Water Council</ENAMEX> is to set up a program funded by eminent <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> sponsors .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Zaid</ENAMEX> said that the scarcity of water in the region dates back <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years</ENAMEX> and continues to increase at a rate in line with the population increase , alongside threats to water resources from rivers shared with neighboring countries and a worsening economic situation in several <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries which impedes steps towards development .
He said that the difficult equation in the region is that of achieving food security since food production uses up around <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 %</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> water resources .
This means that there has to be cooperation in order to make use of the excess in some countries , alongside increased <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> investments in the field mentioned and the creation of cooperation strategies .
The head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Center for Water Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shadin Abduljawad</ENAMEX> , presented a report to the conference which said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">65 %</ENAMEX> of our water resources originate from outside the borders of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries and that the percentage of water desalination in the arid <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> region is close to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 %</ENAMEX> .
