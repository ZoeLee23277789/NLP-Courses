    For his part, Ismail said that he transmitted a verbal message from President Al-Bashir to Lahoud in which he expressed
    his " concern about the developments, and the importance for all institutions and active forces to hold back this
    escalation and transfer the dialogue to meeting halls under the dome of the parliament, and reach an expanded government
    that includes the political forces, " noting that there is concern by all Lebanese parties that things could get worse
    and that there is consensus about the preference for moving the dialogue from the streets to the parliament, the
    importance of expanding the government, and that the opposition forces should effectively participate in it.
