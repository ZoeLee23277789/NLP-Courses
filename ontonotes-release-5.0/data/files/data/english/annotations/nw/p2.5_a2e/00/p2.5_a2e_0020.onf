    standards, all this is perfectly true, but what is the point of continuing to denounce and condemn this oppressive
    blockade a thousand million times without trying, even once for the sake of God and the country, to find an exit or
    solution to this crisis, even if the matter requires us to step down a little from the seats of power which are, in
    essence, no more than an autonomous authority under the hegemony of direct Israeli military occupation, and in the light
    of the Western sponsor countries ' pre-set conditions..
