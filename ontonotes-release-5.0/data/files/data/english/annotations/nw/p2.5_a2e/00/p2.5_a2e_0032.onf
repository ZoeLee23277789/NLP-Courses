    The truth of what we have warned against time after time has been proven right beyond doubt, which is that combat in the
    streets and mobilization of public opinion in futile battles can only result in more draining of the nation and the
    people, crushing any hope for economic recovery, further distorting the image of Lebanon abroad, and reaching a point of
    no return in a conflict with absolutely no end in sight except the destruction of the country on top of everyone in it.
