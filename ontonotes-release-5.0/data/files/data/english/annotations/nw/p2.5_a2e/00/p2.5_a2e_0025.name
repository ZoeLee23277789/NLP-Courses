<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al - Hayat</ENAMEX> has learned that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levni</ENAMEX> informed the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> side , during her recent visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Paris</ENAMEX> , that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> will not make moves towards withdrawing from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Shebaa Farms</ENAMEX> prior to a comprehensive peace agreement .
Sources saw <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> as wanting to hold back all its cards in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> file , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shebaa</ENAMEX> , because it does not know how things will develop in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> side insisted during talks with the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Minister on the need to strengthen <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fuad Siniora 's</ENAMEX> government through a political victory by having <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> state its willingness to withdraw from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shebaa</ENAMEX> , under a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> government that respects the implementation of Security Council resolutions .
However , sources noted that " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> does not agree to such a step " , saying that " there is a widespread impression among circles informed on <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> politics that just as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> wants the current <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> regime to stay in place - and it proved this in its war on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> last summer - then with the same logic , it is comfortable with a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> regime in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and a government in which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hizbollah</ENAMEX> is represented but under the control of a specific , known <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> regime " .
The sources said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levni</ENAMEX> did not come up with anything new on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> front but " reiterated the usual position which says that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> does a lot , is committed to the ceasefire and self - control and that the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> government -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Olmert</ENAMEX> -RRB- has extended his hand to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
She also reiterated preconditions to any change , including the need for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> to work towards putting their house in order . "
The sources concluded by saying that " a state of stagnation surrounds all open files concerning <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> and the cards that can be played are very few " .
