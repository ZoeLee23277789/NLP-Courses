Another bloody message received by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> with the assassination of the young minister fighting for the independence and sovereignty of his country , Industry Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Gemayel</ENAMEX> , who worked with the majority to reinstate sovereignty and to put an end to outside intervention .
How is it possible then for the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> to accept not having an international court ?
And is it reasonable that these crimes occur and that the noble sons of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> who fight for freedom and sovereignty continue to be eliminated one after the other , and that certain <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries still have reservations about the international court ?
The targeting of the martyred minister who paid for his country 's sovereignty with his life , is a message of intimidation from the criminals who have already assassinated former Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafik Hariri</ENAMEX> and Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basil Fleihan</ENAMEX> and their colleagues , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jibran Tueni</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samir Kasir</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Hawi</ENAMEX> .
They are also the ones who tried to assassinate Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marwan Hamadi</ENAMEX> and his colleague <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">May Shidyaq</ENAMEX> .
The killers want to terrorize the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> and spread fear and destabilization , at a time when the international court is approaching them and aims to expose the truth .
Does <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> not have the right to set an example by punishing the murderers of its officials and its youth ?
All those who resist the establishment of an international court must see today that the reason for the assassination of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Gemayel</ENAMEX> was to instigate a coup against those who want to liberate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and reinstate its sovereignty .
And preventing the adoption of the international court is a response to the will of those murderers who want to eliminate <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> 's youth and to all those who have a promising future in a sovereign and independent country .
What is noticeable is that the murderers target the youth who have a role to play in the country 's future and who follow the principles that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pierre Gemayel</ENAMEX> followed which are independence , boldness and courage .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> is being subjected to destabilization and no state , foreign or <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> , has the right to reject the international court .
