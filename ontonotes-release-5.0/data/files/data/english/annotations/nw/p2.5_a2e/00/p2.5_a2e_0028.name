President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> reminds me of the proverb , " Too much of anything will turn against itself . "
He has listened to the opinions of all the people on the subject of the war against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , to the point where he has decided to postpone his speech about any change of direction there from <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">this month</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the next</ENAMEX> .
Everyone has heard about the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baker</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hamilton</ENAMEX> report , but the president has received this week other reports from both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Department of State</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> , and from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the National Security Council</ENAMEX> .
He spoke directly with Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Condoleezza Rice</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Rumsfeld</ENAMEX> , and he listened to military commanders , including the joint chiefs of staff , and to others outside the government .
He then conducted a closed - circuit television communication with field commanders in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> as well as divine communications through his open line to " Upstairs . "
And between this and that , he met with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iraqi</ENAMEX> Vice-President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tarik Al - Hashimi</ENAMEX> , before him <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdel - Aziz Al - Hakim</ENAMEX> , the Head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq</ENAMEX> , and prior to them with Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nouri Al - Maliki</ENAMEX> .
All the preceding is either incidental or transient , but the permanent is the existence of <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">16</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> government intelligence agencies , each of which submits its own reports to the president , and together they submit the " National Intelligence Estimate " each year , with the National Intelligence Director , a newly created post currently occupied by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Negroponte</ENAMEX> , supervising the intelligence work .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> does not read , and if he reads he does not understand .
He listens and he forgets , for words go in one ear and out the other , while the president is thinking about fishing on his ranch in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Texas</ENAMEX> where the local opinion about him is that he is " A cowboy with a hat , without any cattle . "
