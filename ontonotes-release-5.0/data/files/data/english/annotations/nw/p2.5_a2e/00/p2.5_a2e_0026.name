The latest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> war on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last July</ENAMEX> dealt the economy a deadly blow while it was recovering from a harsh recession that had started after the assassination of former Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rafiq Al Hariri</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">February 2005</ENAMEX> .
The war negatively affected all economic sectors and the life of every <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> , directly or indirectly , undermining the monetary and financial situation in the country and shaking the trust of foreign investors .
It seems that the economic repercussions of this war will keep exhausting <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> for a long time , according to a comprehensive study on the case issued by " <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">InfoPro</ENAMEX> , " a private <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> organization for economic research .
The study comes in <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">200</ENAMEX> medium - sized pages .
It is published in <ENAMEX TYPE="LANGUAGE">English</ENAMEX> under the title , " <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Economic Effect of the July 2006 War and Steps for Recovery</ENAMEX> . "
It goes beyond providing a comprehensive perspective on the extent of the damage caused to the different economic sectors as a result of the war , to demonstrate practical ways to recovery in each of them , through the treatments proposed for the immediate activation of performance as well as plans to achieve sustained economic recovery .
In terms of its comprehensiveness , the study is considered the first of its kind to be published after the war .
During the days of aggression , and after the end of the violence , economic agencies as well as the public sector announced many estimates of the damages left behind by the war .
Their inconsistency left observers in a state of confusion , when the ambiguity of the general economic scene was surrounded by cloudiness .
