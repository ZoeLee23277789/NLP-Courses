The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> situation has never been worse than it is at the present time , in spite of everything the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> have lived through over a period of a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">century</ENAMEX> , with its crises and ordeals , its suffering , wars and catastrophes .
Given his responsibilities and powers , it was not possible for the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud Abbas</ENAMEX> , to postpone yet again the vital decisions he needs to take to find a peaceful , democratic way out of this all - encompassing and violent crisis which is asphyxiating the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> and threatening their security and the security of their children , preventing them from providing the bare essentials for life to continue , whether it be a loaf of bread or a sip of milk or a medicine tablet .
Everything that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abbas</ENAMEX> ' government says about the economic blockade is completely correct and true .
It is an oppressive blockade that punishes the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> people for their democratic choice and is based on double standards , all this is perfectly true , but what is the point of continuing to denounce and condemn this oppressive blockade <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">a thousand million</ENAMEX> times without trying , even once for the sake of God and the country , to find an exit or solution to this crisis , even if the matter requires us to step down a little from the seats of power which are , in essence , no more than an autonomous authority under the hegemony of direct <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> military occupation , and in the light of the Western sponsor countries ' pre-set conditions . .
