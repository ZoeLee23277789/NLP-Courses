    The statement, of which Al-Quds Al-Arabi received a copy, added that at a time when Iraqi national forces are seeking to
    obtain a timetable for the withdrawal of the occupation forces from our country, taking advantage of the political
    developments on the American scene to take this injustice and despotism away from our people, the present government is
    seeking once again to grant the occupation a chance to stay on, holding on to its presence for no other reason than to
    secure guarantees of its remaining in power at the expense of suspending the interests of the Iraqis, their violated
    sacred sites, and their blood that bleeds like rivers every day.
