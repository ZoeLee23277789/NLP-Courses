In the first hours of dawn <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the US Congress</ENAMEX> adopted the final draft of a proposed bill to isolate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> by preventing <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> from helping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> does not recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's right to exist and does not reject violence .
The bill , which was prepared by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> and adopted by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> in a show - of - hands vote , also requires that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> recognize the peace agreements that were signed between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , and prohibits the granting of entrance visas to members of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Palestinian Authority</ENAMEX> as long as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> continues to lead the government and does not accept these requirments .
But the bill , which is now ready for <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Bush</ENAMEX> to sign , allows for the continuation of humanitarian aid - food , water , and medicine - and the aid which allows <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud Abbas</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Mazen</ENAMEX> - to perform his duties .
The bill represents a slightly modified version of a bill voted on by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Senate</ENAMEX> which had raised objections by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Administration</ENAMEX> , and it allows the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Administration</ENAMEX> to rally around the ban <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Congress</ENAMEX> has imposed in the name of national security of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</ENAMEX> prayers in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Tehran</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ismail Haniya</ENAMEX> renewed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Hamas</ENAMEX> ' declaration that it will not recognize <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
He confirmed that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> movement will continue on the road of resistance until the occupied city of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Jerusalem</ENAMEX> has been liberated .
He added that the international community and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> are asking us to recognize the theft of our land , to stop jihad and resistance , and to respect previously signed agreements , confirming that these things will never happen .
