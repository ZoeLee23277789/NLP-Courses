In the midst of the deep and tragic crisis <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> is witnessing and which has devastated the existence of many people in the region , and under skies clouded over by fears of an intensification of any crisis in the region , it would seem that there is a glimmer of hope on the horizon .
This new hope draws its momentum from the ceasefire decision announced <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</ENAMEX> and from the possibility of a meeting being held between President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mahmoud Abbas</ENAMEX> and Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Olmert</ENAMEX> .
There is no doubt that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> backs all the efforts made in this context which are aimed at reviving the peace process , which is what the region needs most .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The European Union</ENAMEX> is in no way prepared to consent to this region , the closest and dearest to its heart , remaining in a state of permanent chaos .
What affects the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Middle East</ENAMEX> affects the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Europeans</ENAMEX> directly and vice versa .
This has always been so and this is the reason this relationship has a distinct and unique style .
Today , I see <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">four</ENAMEX> challenges which we have to face together : the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> - <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> conflict , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> nuclear issue , the situation in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> and the war in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> .
My view of the conflict between the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israelis</ENAMEX> is not new as I have always considered that this conflict is , in one way or another , at the heart of all the other conflicts .
Perhaps resolving this conflict will not necessarily lead to a resolution of other current regional crises but it will deprive fundamentalist rhetoric of its usual justifications and this would be a big step in its own right .
When the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> manage , tomorrow or after tomorrow , to agree to form a new national unity government , this will constitute an important step towards a solution .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">The European Union 's</ENAMEX> reaction will be prompt .
