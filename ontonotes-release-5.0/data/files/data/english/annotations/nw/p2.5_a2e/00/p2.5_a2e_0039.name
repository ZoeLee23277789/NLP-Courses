Former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> is braving a savage <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> and the rest of the Western countries because he dared to speak out and break the barrier of silence , by comparing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hebrew</ENAMEX> state to the white racist regime of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">South Africa</ENAMEX> and exposing the violations by its governments of the rights of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinians</ENAMEX> .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> faced a series of accusations beginning with anti-Semitism and ending with spreading lies , while he is the man who won the Nobel Peace Prize , and achieved for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> the greatest strategic accomplishment in its short history , which is the signing of <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the Camp David Accords</ENAMEX> that split <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> ranks and got <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> out of the confrontation , and established the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">first</ENAMEX> diplomatic relations between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> and the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> State .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> 's book , which is on the best - seller book list , came as a shock to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> lobby and a breach of its domination in the American media and political institutions , at a time when the whole world is paying an exorbitant price for the wars of the neo-conservatives , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> 's supporters , in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iraq</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> , and soon in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> .
And perhaps some might argue that President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> did not speak as forcefully and dare to confront the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Jewish</ENAMEX> lobby until after he left power , and is nearing the last stages of his senior age , which is true .
But the man did not last in power more than <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">one</ENAMEX> term -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">four years</ENAMEX> -RRB- , and when he began to understand the truth of the conflict in the region , he lost the presidential elections .
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> sided with his conscience as a human being , and he decided to speak his mind strongly and sharply against a racist state which hijacked , through its supporters , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the White House</ENAMEX> and the decision - making circle in it , and exploited it to serve its interests and its wars , and to cover for its crimes against the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Palestinian</ENAMEX> people and the entire <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> nation .
