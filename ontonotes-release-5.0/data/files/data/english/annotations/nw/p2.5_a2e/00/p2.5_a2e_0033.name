President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Emile Lahoud</ENAMEX> believed that " the opposition has a right to one - third plus one in government with the goal of participating , not invalidating " and described the idea of appointing a neutral minister who does not resign or vote on important issues as " heresy " .
He repeated that " there is no way out of the present situation other than through a national unity government in which all sides are represented and which takes charge of setting up a fair and non-politicized international court .
It will put in place modern laws for the parliamentary elections , with equality between all regions , on the basis of which a new parliament and a new President of the Republic will be elected to represent the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> " .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lahoud</ENAMEX> continued , in a speech he gave yesterday before a delegation of the follow - up committee of <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the " First Conference of the Arab Resistance in Iqlim Kharoub "</ENAMEX> led by former deputy <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zahir Al - Khatib</ENAMEX> , with his campaign against <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Chirac</ENAMEX> and the parliamentary majority , in which he emphasized that " a civil war will not occur in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> " .
He said that " I am the boy 's father and it is my duty to maintain the constitution ; this is my strength " .
Just by agreeing to an interim government , there will be <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> governments , and this will affect the army and many state matters .
I can not agree to <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">two</ENAMEX> governments in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> .
All I ask for is there in the constitution .
This ministry is not legitimate and they know it .
Can peaceful demonstrations happen in the form they are taking place today in spite of the large number of demonstrators ?
They want to create problems , then they say they want to bring the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> together .
But bringing the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> together is not only a matter of words ; it requires work as happened when the army was united .
