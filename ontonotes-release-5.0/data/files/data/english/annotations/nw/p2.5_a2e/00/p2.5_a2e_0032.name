President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Najib Mikati</ENAMEX> proposed setting up a new government " whose goal is cooperation and partnership , and not obstruction and toppling , " one that includes politicians -LRB- ... -RRB- and experts in economic affairs -LRB- ... -RRB-
One of its tasks is to put down a new election law .
In a statement <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</ENAMEX> he said : " What further dangerous signs need to appear for the parties to the conflict in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> to realize the magnitude of the harm that has been done so far , and which could take a more explosive bent if they do not rectify the situation and return immediately to dialogue , and without any pre-conditions . "
The truth of what we have warned against time after time has been proven right beyond doubt , which is that combat in the streets and mobilization of public opinion in futile battles can only result in more draining of the nation and the people , crushing any hope for economic recovery , further distorting the image of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> abroad , and reaching a point of no return in a conflict with absolutely no end in sight except the destruction of the country on top of everyone in it .
All the parties in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> understand that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Lebanon</ENAMEX> can not be governed by one side or by marginal alliances at the expense of any other side .
It therefore rests on the principle of consensual democracy , and the shared - living agreement is an unavoidable fait accompli .
All of them agreed on the principle of a special tribunal with an international character ; they acknowledged the existence of a crisis of governance and institutions ; and they recognized in principle the need to form a national unity government that constitutes the obvious prelude to a partnership in addressing the accumulating <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> crises .
