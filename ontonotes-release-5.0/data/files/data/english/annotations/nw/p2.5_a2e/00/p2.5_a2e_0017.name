A classified <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> document revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> had considered implementing a plan that would have changed the course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Nile</ENAMEX> in order to put pressure on former President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gamal Abdel Nasser</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1956</ENAMEX> to relent on his decision to nationalize <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Suez Canal</ENAMEX> .
The document , which was published yesterday as part of a number of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> Intelligence documents that were declassified after the passage of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">fifty years</ENAMEX> , stated that the commanders of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> army who prepared the plan believed the course of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Nile</ENAMEX> could be changed to cut off <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 %</ENAMEX> of the water reaching the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> lands .
This would damage vast agricultural areas in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> , as well as transportation , and would thereby destroy the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> economy and weaken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdel Nasser</ENAMEX> internally .
According to this plan , it was decided that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> would use a dam in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> in order to lower the water level in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the White Nile</ENAMEX> by seven - eighths .
The plan was actually presented to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> Prime Minister at the time , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Eden</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">several weeks</ENAMEX> before the start of the tripartite attacks on <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> , in which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> participated .
The document stated that the implementation of the plan was later abandoned because <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> feared it might backfire violently on the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptian</ENAMEX> side .
Also , those who prepared the plan realized that the project might take <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">months</ENAMEX> to carry out , and in addition would cause damage to other countries , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kenya</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Uganda</ENAMEX> .
The document also revealed that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Hunt</ENAMEX> , the former <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">British</ENAMEX> Cabinet Secretary , observed that the plan could only be effective if a rumor was spread among <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Egyptians</ENAMEX> - who were mostly illiterate at the time - that if <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdel Nasser</ENAMEX> did not step down , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Britain</ENAMEX> would lower the level of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Nile</ENAMEX> .
