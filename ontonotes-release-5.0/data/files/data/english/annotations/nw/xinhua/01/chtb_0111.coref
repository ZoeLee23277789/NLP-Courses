Xinhua News Agency , <COREF ID="chtb_111-E1" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> , January 13th , by reporter Xisheng , Zhou
In recent years , a large number of foreign enterprises of great strength and great developmental vision have entered <COREF ID="19232" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Stock Exchange</COREF> .
According to statistics , currently , foreign enterprises listed * on <COREF ID="19232" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Stock Exchange</COREF> have reached more than 340 , *PRO* tripling the figure 5 years ago .
According to presentations by people from <COREF ID="19232" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Stock Exchange</COREF> , in the early '90's , big enterprises entering <COREF ID="19251" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="chtb_111-E1" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> market</COREF> were mainly from economically developed countries in Europe , Japan , etc. , but things have changed in recent years .
The number of non-governmental enterprises from countries in Central and South America , such as Mexico , Argentina , etc. , that *T*-1 have come to <COREF ID="chtb_111-E1" TYPE="IDENT">New York</COREF> *PRO*-1 to enter <COREF ID="19251" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> has distinctly increased .
Powerful enterprises from developing countries in Asia and the Middle and Eastern Europe , including Russia , China , etc. are beginning *-3 to be listed *-3 on <COREF ID="19232" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Stock Exchange</COREF> .
Currently , the number of countries and regions whose enterprises *T*-5 are listed *-5 on <COREF ID="19232" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Stock Exchange</COREF> is almost 50 .
<COREF ID="19299" TYPE="IDENT">Last year</COREF> , there were 61 foreign enterprises recently listed * on <COREF ID="19232" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Stock Exchange</COREF> , *PRO* creating the highest record in the history .

On the basis of analysis , the main reason why so many foreign enterprises are listed *-12 on the US securities exchange market *T*-13 is the continuous and steady increase of the US economy , and that <COREF ID="19232" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Stock Exchange</COREF> is a relatively ideal place for *PRO* raising capital , with its strict management and regulated operation .
Statistics show that , capital that foreign enterprises raised *T*-17 on <COREF ID="19232" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Stock Exchange</COREF> has reached 60 billion US dollars since 1992 .
But financial experts from Wall Street warn that , <COREF ID="19347" TYPE="IDENT">foreign enterprises</COREF> entering <COREF ID="19232" TYPE="IDENT">the New York Stock Exchange</COREF> , to a large extent , means that <COREF ID="19347" TYPE="IDENT">these enterprises</COREF> need *-18 to adopt <COREF ID="19353" TYPE="IDENT">the strict operations and financial management methods</COREF> of the US .
If <COREF ID="19355" TYPE="IDENT">foreign enterprises</COREF> still lack the conditions *PRO* to apply <COREF ID="19353" TYPE="IDENT">these methods</COREF> , <COREF ID="19355" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should not rush blindly *PRO*-1 to enter <COREF ID="19251" TYPE="IDENT">the New York market</COREF> , lest <COREF ID="19355" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> be left *-19 *PRO*-19 out in the cold .
