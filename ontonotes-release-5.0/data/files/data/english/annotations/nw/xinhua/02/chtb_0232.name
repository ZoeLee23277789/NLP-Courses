Recently , related experts and scholars discovered a large quantity of dinosaur bones fossils in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yangcheng Township , Xixia County</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Henan Province</ENAMEX> .
This is another big discovery coming after an abundance of precious dinosaur eggs fossils were discovered here at <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the beginning of last year</ENAMEX> .

Because of long - term exposure at the ground 's surface , some are already broken .
From the view of stratigraphy , they all belong to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the Cretaceous period</ENAMEX> .
