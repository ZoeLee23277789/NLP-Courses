The White Paper , <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">" Regarding the China - US Balance of Trade Problem "</ENAMEX> , announced by <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">State Department News Office</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , pointed out that the unreasonableness of trade statistics determined according to the original site of manufacture principle was where the essence lay in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's trade deficit with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> being seriously exaggerated , and in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sino - American</ENAMEX> trade balance situation being distorted .
The White Paper said that because of a lack of unified original production site rules , each country , when formulating its own original production site rule , often starts out from the needs of its own country , and standards differ , degrees of strictness vary , and randomness sometimes exists in assessing the original production site of imported goods .
The White Paper said that now , because economic trade relationships among countries in the world develop rapidly , cross-national investments increase daily , exchanges in international trade are no longer goods produced in an individual country , but " world products " crossing national boundaries .
Methods of calculating export trade according to current original production sites , make it obviously difficult to accurately reflect general trends in changes in world economic development .
It could even distort the balance of trade situation among countries .
In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the past two to three decades</ENAMEX> , rapid development in the processing trade in some countries and regions had increased the complexity of this problem .
The White Paper said , since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 90's</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of the important ingredients of the growth of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's foreign trade exports was the expansion of processing trade exports .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's processing trade was mainly developed from the transfer of labor - intensive manufacturing industries or work processes from developed countries such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Japan</ENAMEX> , etc. and countries and regions such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Singapore</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Korea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Taiwan</ENAMEX> , etc. , in order to reduce production costs and raise competitiveness .
Its products rely on original sales channels , transferring from places like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> , etc. to traditional markets such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> etc .
By original production site rule statistics , product exporting countries shifted from these countries and regions to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
The White Paper said that in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">recent years</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two thirds</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's exports to the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> were transferred out through the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> region .
These products ' value - added rates in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> are far higher than the value - added rates in mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> actual benefits are far higher than mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> .
If <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> larger value - added portions are counted as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Hong Kong 's</ENAMEX> exports , then <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> 's trade surplus with the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> could correspondingly decrease , even becoming a deficit .
The White Paper thereby drew the conclusion and held that , when using original production site statistics , its limitations must be fully recognized , superficial figures must be seen through , and the actual benefit that each party achieves from trade must be seriously analyzed .
This will then help to eliminate misunderstanding , and appropriately solve trade disputes between countries .
At the same time , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> must also consider the increasingly growing trend of increasingly close international economic interaction and international investment , service trade , etc. , improve and perfect trade statistical methods , make statistical data objective and realistic , create good conditions for mutually beneficial co-operation among various countries of the world and healthy development of world economic trade .
