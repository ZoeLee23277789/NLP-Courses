News of victory came again from <COREF ID="22397" TYPE="IDENT">the Qinghai Oil Field</COREF> in the New Year : by the end of December of 97 , oil output reached 1.6 million tons .
<COREF ID="22397" TYPE="IDENT">This oil field 's</COREF> oil output has exceeded 1 million tons for 7 years in a row .
<COREF ID="22397" TYPE="IDENT">The Qinhai Oil Field</COREF> is located *-21 in <COREF ID="22414" TYPE="IDENT">the Chaidamu Basin</COREF> in the north of the Qingzang Plateau , with a total area of 24 square kilometers .
Since *PRO* being prospecting and explored * in 1954 , more than 15.5 million tons of crude oil have been produced *-23 , and almost 8 million tons of crude oil have been processed *-24 .
According to presentations , in recent years , <COREF ID="22397" TYPE="IDENT">the oil field 's</COREF> dynamics of exploration , development and investment in oil resources has been strengthened *-25 , nearly one billion yuan of exploration funds has been invested *-26 , and prospected oil reserves have annually increased by over 40 million tons on average .
Through measurements and calculations of new exploration data , nearly 4.2 billion tons of oil resources in <COREF ID="22414" TYPE="IDENT">the Chaidamu Basin</COREF> have been confirmed *-27 .
Currently , proven oil reserves of 22 oil fields are more than 200 million tons , and natural gas is more than 150 billion cubic meters .
This scale is only second to Sichuan , Shanganning , and Tarim , *PRO* claiming the fourth place of all gas fields in <COREF ID="22470" TYPE="IDENT">the whole country</COREF> .
It *EXP*-38 was learned *-39 that , <COREF ID="22470" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> has planned *PRO*-29 to take advantage of the rich oil gas resources in <COREF ID="22414" TYPE="IDENT">this area</COREF> during the " ninth five - year plan " -LRB- 1996 to 2000 -RRB- , through methods such as *PRO* introducing foreign investment , jointly raising funds with the locality , etc. *PRO* to build a large - scale combination project of the natural gas industry and the salt industry , which *T*-30 will be capable of *PRO* producing 120,000 tons of PVC , 100,000 tons of caustic soda , 200,000 tons of synthetic ammonia , and 300,000 tons of carbamide .
Currently , the supplementary construction of two gas pipes nearly 300 kilometers in total length and a natural gas power station with a capacity of 16 kilowatts have been completed *-31 and put *-31 into production .
The 280 kilometer long third natural gas pipe leading through the residential and scientific research base of <COREF ID="22535" TYPE="IDENT">the Qinghai Petroleum Bureau</COREF> - Gansu , Dunhuang and <COREF ID="22539" TYPE="IDENT">the Ge'ermu oil refinery</COREF> with an annual production capacity of 100,000 tons of carbinol will break ground and start construction this year .
Moreover , in order *PRO* to improving the added value of oil products , <COREF ID="22554" TYPE="IDENT">the second phase project of <COREF ID="22539" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="22535" TYPE="IDENT">the Qinghai Petroleum Bureau 's</COREF> Ge'ermu oil refinery</COREF></COREF> , with a total investment of 260 million yuan , has been completed *-34 and put *-34 into production .
<COREF ID="22554" TYPE="IDENT">The project</COREF> mainly consists of the catalysis and reconditioning of # 90 unleaded gasoline with an annual output of 150,000 tons and a hydrogenation diesel oil unit with an annual output of 150,000 tons .
*PRO* Putting <COREF ID="22554" TYPE="IDENT">this project</COREF> into production will further improve <COREF ID="22539" TYPE="IDENT">the factory 's</COREF> oil products structure , and increase market competitive ability .
The China Petroleum and Natural Gas Corporation has determined *PRO*-37 to list <COREF ID="22414" TYPE="IDENT">the Chaidamu Basin</COREF> as a major area for <COREF ID="22470" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> oil gas exploration , and has planned *PRO*-37 to achieve an annual oil gas output of 3 million tons , and an annual output reaching 10 million tons by the year 2005 .
People in economic circles pointed out that the rich oil gas resources in <COREF ID="22414" TYPE="IDENT">the Chaidamu Basin</COREF> would lay a good material foundation for *PRO* shifting <COREF ID="22470" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> energy industry center to the west .
