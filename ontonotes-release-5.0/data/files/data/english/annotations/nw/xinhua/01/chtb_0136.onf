    Director of Tianjin's Taiwanese Affair Department, Gengxin Qu said, although there was a slowing down in the growth rate
    of Taiwanese merchants ' investments in Tianjin due to the hindrance of Taiwanese authorities last year, resulted in
    only 94 recently approved Taiwanese capital corporations and the total agreed investment value reaching 250 million US
    dollars which were both lower than that achieved in the previous year, but the quality and technological standards of
    investments both have further improvements.
