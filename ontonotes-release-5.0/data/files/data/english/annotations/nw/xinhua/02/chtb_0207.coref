At 3,776 meters above sea level , <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Mount Fuji</COREF> does n't even reach one half way up Mount Qomolangma , but in this archipelago on the western rim of the Pacific Ocean , <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> <COREF ID="31929" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> still the greatest of 1,000 peaks and a masterpiece of nature .
<COREF ID="31929" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> makes <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> stand out among the world 's innumerable volcanic remnants like a crane among chickens .
No wonder that Japanese people regard <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> as a gift of nature and call <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> *PRO*-1 " sacred mountain . "
It just so happened that the annual meeting of the International Germanic Language and Literature Association that *T*-21 is held *-21 every five years was <COREF ID="31955" TYPE="IDENT">held</COREF> *-23 in <COREF ID="31953" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> this year .
<COREF ID="31955" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> allowed <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">this writer</COREF> to get a glance at <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Fuji 's</COREF> charisma and to be able *PRO*-24 to settle *PRO*-24 realizing an " inordinate ambition " of many years .
<COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Mount Fuji</COREF> <COREF ID="31970" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> only 80 kilometers from <COREF ID="31953" TYPE="IDENT">Tokyo</COREF> -- <COREF ID="31970" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> obviously was also specially arranged *-36 by good fortune : <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31975" TYPE="IDENT">this island nation 's</COREF> highest mountain</COREF> and <COREF ID="31953" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31975" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> largest city</COREF> depend on <COREF ID="31977" TYPE="IDENT">one another</COREF> as partners and mutually reflect <COREF ID="31977" TYPE="IDENT">one another</COREF> .
Thereupon , like a light boat on a familiar route , <COREF ID="31983" TYPE="IDENT">the large tour bus that <COREF ID="32091" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> rode *T*-26</COREF> raced directly toward the southwest -- the direction of <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Mount Fuji</COREF> .
Without anyone being aware of <COREF ID="31992" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , the dense forest almost completely <COREF ID="31992" TYPE="IDENT">sealed</COREF> <COREF ID="31994" TYPE="IDENT">the road</COREF> off from the sky above .
It turned out that <COREF ID="31994" TYPE="IDENT">the road</COREF> had already narrowed , moreover <COREF ID="31994" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was sloping .
One look out the window was enough for one to know that <COREF ID="31983" TYPE="IDENT">the bus</COREF> was already suspended *-27 half way up <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">the mountain</COREF> !
In just a little bit , at a small patch of open terrain , <COREF ID="32013" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32014" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the tour guide</COREF> --- <COREF ID="32014" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a woman with mastery of five European languages</COREF> --</COREF> ordered <COREF ID="31983" TYPE="IDENT">the bus</COREF> *PRO*-28 to stop .
<COREF ID="32013" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> let <COREF ID="32022" TYPE="IDENT">everyone</COREF> hasten *PRO*-29 to view and enjoy <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">the sacred mountain 's</COREF> countenance , *PRO* taking advantage of an opportune moment of <COREF ID="32030" TYPE="IDENT">the sun</COREF> revealing <COREF ID="32030" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> smiling face and extending <COREF ID="32030" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> greeting to <COREF ID="32022" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
<COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> raised <COREF ID="32035" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> head</COREF> in expectation .
Holy Cow !
<COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was at least still more than 1,000 meters in height and the precipitous slope was n't under 60 plus degrees .
Nearby there was a level slope a few hundred meters wide amidst rows of green trees and withered trees , *PRO*-30 exposing <COREF ID="32053" TYPE="IDENT">raked brown - grey gravel</COREF> .
<COREF ID="32053" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> apparently was the remains of the volcanic ash from the most recent eruption in 1707 .
<COREF ID="32013" TYPE="IDENT">The tour guide</COREF> was urging <COREF ID="32022" TYPE="IDENT">everyone</COREF> *PRO*-31 to board <COREF ID="31983" TYPE="IDENT">the bus</COREF> .
<COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> asked <COREF ID="32013" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> : how long would it take *PRO* to climb to <COREF ID="32069" TYPE="IDENT">the summit</COREF> from here on foot *T*-32 ?
<COREF ID="32013" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> replied *PRO*-33 proclaiming : four to seven hours !
<COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> extended <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> tongue and raised <COREF ID="32035" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> head</COREF> , *PRO*-34 imagining *RNR*-63 and hoping for *RNR*-63 a glance at <COREF ID="32069" TYPE="IDENT">the summit</COREF> , but only saw clouds wafting in the air .
<COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw no lofty mountain peak .
<COREF ID="31983" TYPE="IDENT">The large tour bus</COREF> started up again and <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> thought , this time <COREF ID="32091" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *-35 to be going straight to <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Fuji 's</COREF> " ears . "
Suddenly a sound broke <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> train of thought : " It 's not right <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">, Old Ye ,</COREF> how can <COREF ID="31983" TYPE="IDENT">this bus</COREF> go straight down *T*-65 ? " --- that was one of <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> Chinese colleagues .
Thereupon , <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> agitatedly got up and asked <COREF ID="32013" TYPE="IDENT">the tour guide</COREF> : " Why are <COREF ID="32091" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> going back after *PRO* only just getting half way up <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">the mountain</COREF> *T*-66 ? "
<COREF ID="32013" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said : " *PRO* Touring <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Mount Fuji</COREF> does n't at all imply mountain climbing .
What *T*-69 's more , <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Fuji 's</COREF> scenery is not all concentrated *-37 at <COREF ID="32069" TYPE="IDENT">the summit</COREF> y' know .
The scenic spots at <COREF ID="32185" TYPE="IDENT">the foot of <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">the mountain</COREF></COREF> are plentiful ! "
So evidently <COREF ID="31983" TYPE="IDENT">the bus</COREF> really was <COREF ID="32131" TYPE="IDENT">carrying</COREF> <COREF ID="32091" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> down <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">the mountain</COREF> !
<COREF ID="32131" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> being the case , <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> lost no time in *PRO* again catching an eyeful of <COREF ID="32069" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Fuji 's</COREF> peak</COREF> --- <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> practically glued <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> eyes to the glass of the bus window , *PRO*-38 facing the rear in hope .
By coincidence , just while *PRO* looking at <COREF ID="32150" TYPE="IDENT">the ever - changing clouds</COREF> , <COREF ID="32150" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were fortuitously located *-39 at <COREF ID="32069" TYPE="IDENT">the summit</COREF> , and *PRO*-40 resembling cotton , <COREF ID="32150" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> tore open a hole as if *PRO* deliberately allowing <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">the " sacred " one 's</COREF> forehead to venture out , as if *PRO* seeing <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> off and also as if *PRO* laughing at <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
For an instant , a sigh of regret for " great aspirations difficult 0 *PRO* to fulfill *T*-41 " overwhelmed <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> !
Because <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd already come across a face that *T*-42 resembled an old man of lofty mountains many times !
At a spacious and luxurious restaurant at <COREF ID="32185" TYPE="IDENT">the foot of <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Fuji</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="32091" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> ate a definitely not sumptuous western meal .
<COREF ID="32022" TYPE="IDENT">Everyone</COREF> hurriedly cast aside cups and plates , then without leave went nearby and viewed and enjoyed <COREF ID="32194" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32195" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the famous first of " <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Fuji 's</COREF> Five Lakes , "</COREF> <COREF ID="32195" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lake Kawaguchi</COREF></COREF> , and the enchanting sights of <COREF ID="32194" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> surroundings .
At this time the weather got overcast and the water of <COREF ID="32194" TYPE="IDENT">the lake</COREF> was still like a mirror , *PRO* causing people to think of our country 's Jiuzhaigou 's Mirror Lake , and with the result that <COREF ID="32194" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had a kind of special , mysterious flavor .
In the middle of <COREF ID="32194" TYPE="IDENT">the lake</COREF> , besides a couple of slowly moving pleasure boats , there was also the reflection of a group of hills , rising and falling .
It was especially the reflection of <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">the " sacred mountain "</COREF> that *T*-43 most caused people to express wonder .
The luxurious growth by the shore seemed *-1 exactly like <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> emerald necklace .
In the forest the crow 's calls accompanied the happy appearance of the flowers ... ... yet this place still did n't hold <COREF ID="32022" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> so enthralled by the scenery as *PRO* to forget *PRO* to go home .
After some hours <COREF ID="32091" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> then arrived at the famous Hakone scenic area that *T*-47 together with <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">Fuji</COREF> belongs to Izu Park .
<COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">The volcano 's</COREF> wonders appeared prominently before <COREF ID="32091" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> eyes .
The " fire " had already been dormant for 400,000 years , yet vapors rising everywhere and <COREF ID="32270" TYPE="IDENT">crystal clear , boiling hot springs</COREF> testified to <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> vitality and power .
Even though the stink of sulfur filled the air in all directions , nevertheless , people still bravely competed in *PRO*-67 eating those eggs that *T*-48 had been cooked *-48 *PRO*-48 done and cooked *-48 *PRO*-48 black by <COREF ID="32270" TYPE="IDENT">the hot springs</COREF> .
Amazing girls still extended tiny hands into <COREF ID="32270" TYPE="IDENT">the hot springs</COREF> *PRO*-55 to test the temperature , but strangely cried out with sharp sounds on *PRO* being scalded * .
<COREF ID="32270" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was just " <COREF ID="32299" TYPE="IDENT">Hakone 's</COREF> Seven Scalds " -LRB- meaning the seven hot springs -RRB- whose name *T*-57 is known *-57 far and wide .
<COREF ID="32303" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="32270" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> , along with the landscape of the Impenetrable Pass Ancient Road and One Thousand Streams Waterfall , the Nine Headed Dragon , the Immortal 's Stone Field , as well as the numerous Stone Buddhas Groups , etc. of " <COREF ID="32299" TYPE="IDENT">Hakone 's</COREF> Eight Li "</COREF> , makes up a large tourist attraction .
The mountain - climbing bus , the electric cable car , and the suspended cable car that *T*-59 shuttle back and forth make <COREF ID="32303" TYPE="IDENT">this whole group all</COREF> visible to the eye below .
<COREF ID="32331" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The volcano lake , seven kilometers in circumference , below not far away</COREF> --- <COREF ID="32331" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Reed Lake</COREF> , forms a splendorous contrast with <COREF ID="32303" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> once had the thought that , *PRO* relying on <COREF ID="31975" TYPE="IDENT">Japan 's</COREF> technology and economic strength <COREF ID="31975" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> would be able *PRO*-60 to build a road to <COREF ID="32069" TYPE="IDENT">the summit</COREF> or simply put up a cable car , that the reason that <COREF ID="31975" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> has buses come *PRO*-61 to make a sharp turnabout at 2,400 meters above sea level just possibly is in order *PRO* to leave you with a certain degree of difficulty or " uncertain " feeling , to put you into the state of *PRO* having something within sight but beyond reach , to suspend your appetite for a long , long time .
Because beauty really does n't lie in the time of the realization of a desire but lives profoundly in the yearning for the goal .
If <COREF ID="31908" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had ascended <COREF ID="32069" TYPE="IDENT">this dangerous peak</COREF> that day then perhaps <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">this " sacred mountain "</COREF> then would lose <COREF ID="31912" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> eternal enchantment .
