But because <COREF ID="21293" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition <COREF ID="21293" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has over 100 billion US dollars in foreign exchange reserves , <COREF ID="21293" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is n't likely *-2 to sink into the crisis like the other Asian nations .
