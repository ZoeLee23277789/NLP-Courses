<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Russian</ENAMEX> troops held the last ceremony to bid farewell to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the 31st</ENAMEX> .
Soldiers from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> countries , namely , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> will also withdraw from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Berlin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">early September</ENAMEX> .
The occupying armies existing in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> territory will end soon .
On <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1st , 1939</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hitler</ENAMEX> 's army attacked <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Poland</ENAMEX> .
It has just been <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">55 years</ENAMEX> now since <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">the Second World War II</ENAMEX> which brought great suffering to the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and the world .
A total of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four million</ENAMEX> people from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> countries died in this war , including those from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> .
Among them , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USSR</ENAMEX> made a great sacrifice in the war to win over <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">German</ENAMEX> invaders .
Its casualties were <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">nearly 28 million</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">Half a century</ENAMEX> has passed in a flash , with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> experiencing hot war , cold war , turmoil and tremendous changes .
Currently , both the hot and cold wars have passed , but the end of turmoil and conflict is not yet to be seen .
In the early period after the war , the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> large countries , namely the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USSR</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , carved out their spheres of influence in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">the " Yalta agreement "</ENAMEX> , and occupied <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> and its capital by districts .
The highest policy - making authorities in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> then were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the " Control Committee of the Allied States "</ENAMEX> .
Henceforth , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> was split up and in a powerless state for a long period .
Not long after , the contest between the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USSR</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> caused a split in the original anti-fascist coalition , resulting in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">German</ENAMEX> 's division into <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> .
On the western side , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">NATO</ENAMEX> and supported <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West Germany</ENAMEX> for the purpose of keeping the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USSR</ENAMEX> " in check " ; on the eastern side , the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USSR</ENAMEX> organized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> , and built up <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East Germany</ENAMEX> as the bridgehead against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> , being split up , became the frontline of the cold - war confrontation between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">East</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">West</ENAMEX> .
Henceforth , there has not been a single day of peace in the political situation of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , a crisis - ridden continent .
But , <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">since the start of 1989</ENAMEX> , a new turn has occurred in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">European</ENAMEX> situation .
Radical changes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX> , the re-unification of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> , the dissolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Warsaw Pact</ENAMEX> and the disintegration of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">USSR</ENAMEX> all occurred successively , causing difficulties in continuing the original " <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yalta</ENAMEX> system " .
In this great change , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> became the largest beneficiary .
The rise of a re-unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> has changed the proportion of strength in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> , making the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">UK</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , which originally were large world powers , worry about dropping to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">second</ENAMEX> - class big countries .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> , the only superpower <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> , has recently started to regard <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> as a " partner in leadership " , encouraging it to " exercise a leadership role " in world politics .
The reason is obvious : the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">US</ENAMEX> wants to make use of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> 's strength .
A unified <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> is moving <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> from a large economic country to a large political country .
Depending on its own tremendous strength , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Germany</ENAMEX> is playing a leading role in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the European Union</ENAMEX> , and its role as a " giant " is obviously seen by common people .
It spares no efforts in playing a " bridging role " between eastern and western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Europe</ENAMEX> and participating in the " peacekeeping mission " under the banner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations</ENAMEX> , and is striving to be a permanent member country of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the United Nations Security Council</ENAMEX> .
Currently , the historical post-war period is drawing to an end .
But the lesson of blood and tears and the painful experience it left for later generations still needs to continue and earnestly conclude .
