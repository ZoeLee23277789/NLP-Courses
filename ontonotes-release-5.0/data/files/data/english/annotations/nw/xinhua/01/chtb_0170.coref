According to what *T*-11 has been reported *-11 in the Soviet " Science and Life " magazine , biologists in Moscow have discovered that <COREF ID="28629" TYPE="IDENT">a mold element in the cells of plants</COREF> can not only control the propagation of plasmodium in mosquitoes , but can also kill mosquitoes .
<COREF ID="28639" TYPE="IDENT">This method</COREF> will not pollute the environment .
Biologists mixed <COREF ID="28629" TYPE="IDENT">a mold element in the cells of plants</COREF> with pearl powder *PRO*-13 to produce a granulated drug .
This kind of drug can slowly discharge <COREF ID="28629" TYPE="IDENT">the mold element</COREF> from the cells of plants in water .
When <COREF ID="28659" TYPE="IDENT">mosquitoes</COREF> feed *T*-1 , <COREF ID="28659" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> suck <COREF ID="28629" TYPE="IDENT">the mold element</COREF> from the cells of plants into <COREF ID="28659" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bodies .
Experiments have shown that *PRO* adopting <COREF ID="28639" TYPE="IDENT">this method</COREF> can reduce the chances of mosquitoes transmitting malaria down to 1/70th to 1/80th of the original ratio .
