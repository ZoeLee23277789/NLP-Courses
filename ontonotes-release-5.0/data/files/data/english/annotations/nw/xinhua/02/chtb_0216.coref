The International Information Telegraph Agency reports that <COREF ID="33323" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33348" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the heavy - duty transport spaceship</COREF> <COREF ID="33348" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">" Progress M - 24 "</COREF></COREF> was sent *-8 into outer space from the Baikonur spaceship launching site on August 25 .
Carried *-10 aboard were *T*-9 639 kilograms of such articles as food , water , fuel , scientific instruments , etc .
By design , <COREF ID="33323" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="33368" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the heavy - duty spaceship</COREF> <COREF ID="33368" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">" Progress M - 24 "</COREF></COREF> , in unmanned operating mode , can perform automated docking with <COREF ID="33329" TYPE="IDENT">the orbital station</COREF> .

<COREF ID="33394" TYPE="IDENT">This time</COREF> will employ manual control method by <COREF ID="33338" TYPE="IDENT">the astronauts working in <COREF ID="33329" TYPE="IDENT">the orbital station</COREF></COREF> *PRO* to achieve docking from <COREF ID="33329" TYPE="IDENT">the orbital station</COREF> .
<COREF ID="33394" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> will be the last chance for <COREF ID="33323" TYPE="IDENT">this cargo spaceship</COREF> to dock with <COREF ID="33329" TYPE="IDENT">the orbital station</COREF> because the fuel on <COREF ID="33323" TYPE="IDENT">the spaceship</COREF> is already very limited .
If <COREF ID="33394" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> fails , a new cargo spaceship must be launched *-14 *PRO* to transport cargo to <COREF ID="33329" TYPE="IDENT">the orbital station</COREF> .
Also , <COREF ID="33418" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Russian Correspondence Agency</COREF> - <COREF ID="33418" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tass</COREF> reported that <COREF ID="33420" TYPE="IDENT">the Inter-department Committee of the Russian Space Orbital Station Operations</COREF> will also convene a meeting <COREF ID="33317" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> *PRO*-15 to research countermeasures .
