Yet the people of <COREF ID="37854" TYPE="IDENT">our two countries</COREF> nevertheless are similar to one another .
The great Chinese people offered up to <COREF ID="37886" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> <COREF ID="37866" TYPE="IDENT">cultural riches on the spiritual plane and material plane</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="37866" TYPE="IDENT">these riches</COREF> did n't exist , people would not be able *PRO*-13 to describe the course of history . "
