    I once had the thought that, relying on Japan's technology and economic strength she would be able to build a road to
    the summit or simply put up a cable car, that the reason that she has buses come to make a sharp turnabout at 2,400
    meters above sea level just possibly is in order to leave you with a certain degree of difficulty or " uncertain "
    feeling, to put you into the state of having something within sight but beyond reach, to suspend your appetite for a
    long, long time.
