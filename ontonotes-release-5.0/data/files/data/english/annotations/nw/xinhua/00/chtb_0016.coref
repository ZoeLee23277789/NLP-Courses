The second is <COREF ID="3016" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> large margin reduction of tariffs in <COREF ID="3013" TYPE="IDENT">1996</COREF> which *T*-79 will further improve <COREF ID="3016" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> investment environment and attract more foreign businessmen to come *PRO*-83 to invest .
