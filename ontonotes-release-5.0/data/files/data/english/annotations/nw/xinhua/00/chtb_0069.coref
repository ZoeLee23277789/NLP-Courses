Guizhou <COREF ID="11318" TYPE="IDENT">Mao - tai Distillery , which *T*-29 is well - known in <COREF ID="11351" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> and abroad</COREF> , plans *PRO*-30 to implement <COREF ID="11323" TYPE="IDENT">a technology renovation project with an investment surpassing 400 million RMB</COREF> *PRO* to further increase the output of Mao - tai in the next three years .
In order *PRO* to solve the enormous need for capital , <COREF ID="11318" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> is now striving *PRO*-31 to issue stock and to attempt more financing channels .
The information was revealed *-33 a few days ago by <COREF ID="11345" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="11346" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Keliang Ji</COREF> , <COREF ID="11346" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the board chairman of <COREF ID="11318" TYPE="IDENT">the Guizhou Mao - tai Distillery -LRB- Group -RRB- Company of <COREF ID="11351" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="11345" TYPE="IDENT">Keliang Ji</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="11323" TYPE="IDENT">this expansion project</COREF> would increase the annual output capacity of Mao - tai by 2,000 tons , *PRO* reaching an output of 6,000 tons per year by 2000 .
Mao - tai , which *T*-34 is praised *-34 as <COREF ID="11351" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> " national alcoholic drink " , has a very long history , and is called *-36 *PRO*-36 one of the world 's three famous distilled spirits , the other two being French Cognac and the UK 's Scotch whiskey .
Because the art of *PRO* manufacturing <COREF ID="chtb_069-E15" TYPE="IDENT">Mao - tai</COREF> is complicated and <COREF ID="chtb_069-E15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> production cycle is long , the output of Mao - tai is extremely limited .
The annual output only reached 1,200 tons in 1987 .
In recent years , under the support of the national Ministry of Finance and the Light Industry Headquarters , <COREF ID="11318" TYPE="IDENT">the Mao - tai Distillery</COREF> invested 530 million yuan RMB *PRO*-38 to successively implement a two - phase expansion and technology renovation .
Currently , <COREF ID="11318" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has an annual production capacity of 4,000 tons .
In 1997 , <COREF ID="11318" TYPE="IDENT">this plant</COREF> made over 4,400 tons of Mao - tai ; with sales income exceeding 500 million yuan RMB , and profit and taxes reaching 370 million RMB , both being the best levels in history .
<COREF ID="chtb_069-E16" TYPE="IDENT">Mao - tai , which *T*-39 is made *-39 in the <COREF ID="chtb_069-E9" TYPE="IDENT">Chishui river</COREF> valley area in the northern part of Guizhou Province in southwest China</COREF> , is known *-41 for <COREF ID="chtb_069-E16" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> extremely special fermentation technique .
The water used * comes from <COREF ID="chtb_069-E9" TYPE="IDENT">the Chishui river that *T*-42 flows over cinnabar quality soil</COREF> and selectively uses such locally produced raw materials as sorghum , high quality wheat , etc. and is fermented *-43 during the period from the Chinese Dragon Boat Festival to the Double Ninth Festival .
After a total of 10 months fermentation , which *T*-44 requires *PRO* adding material twice , distilling 7 times , fermenting 8 times , and braising and boiling 9 times , <COREF ID="chtb_069-E16" TYPE="IDENT">the spirit</COREF> is then put *-47 into specially made earthen jars , sealed *-47 and stored *-47 for over three years .
Finally , <COREF ID="chtb_069-E16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is finished *-51 by veteran brewers carefully mixing additives .
What *T*-52 makes <COREF ID="chtb_069-E17" TYPE="IDENT">Mao - tai</COREF> even more famous is that first generation leaders of new China had used <COREF ID="chtb_069-E17" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-53 to entertain distinguished guests such as former president Nixon of the US , <COREF ID="11487" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tanaka Kakuei</COREF> , <COREF ID="11487" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">former prime minister of Japan</COREF> , etc .
