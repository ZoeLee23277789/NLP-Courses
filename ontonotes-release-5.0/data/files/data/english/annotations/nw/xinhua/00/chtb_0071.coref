<COREF ID="11716" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said that <COREF ID="11728" TYPE="IDENT">next year 's</COREF> main tasks of economic system reform will be : *PRO* maintaining the direction of the reform of <COREF ID="11749" TYPE="IDENT">the socialist market economy</COREF> ; further adjusting and perfecting ownership structures ; accelerating the pace of *PRO* creating a modern enterprise system for state - owned enterprises ; vigorously promoting strategic reform of the state owned economy ; accelerating restructuring ; appropriately placing departing extraneous personnel ; implementing re-employment projects ; deepening financial system reforms ; continuing * to strengthen and improve macroscopic control ; promoting grain and cotton circulation system reform ; actively developing agriculture industrialization operations ; actively promoting organization reform ; transforming <COREF ID="11729" TYPE="IDENT">the government 's</COREF> economic management methods ; examining the system of management , supervision , and operation of state - owned assets ; deepening reforms in the systems of social security and housing ; striving *PRO* to improve urban integrated support reform ; and making substantial progress in *PRO* setting up new systems .
<COREF ID="11716" TYPE="IDENT">Tieying Li</COREF> said that <COREF ID="11728" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF> <COREF ID="11788" TYPE="IDENT">the focus on *PRO* deepening reform in <COREF ID="11729" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> state - owned enterprises</COREF> is advancing as a whole and would use companies as <COREF ID="11788" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> main units of operation *PRO* to implement comprehensive system innovation for the goal of *PRO* establishing a modern enterprise system .
<COREF ID="11729" TYPE="IDENT">The Chinese government</COREF> recently pointed out that it would take about 3 years *PRO* to extricate <COREF ID="11810" TYPE="IDENT">the majority of large and medium - sized state - owned enterprises with a deficit</COREF> from <COREF ID="11810" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> current plight through *PRO* reforming , restructuring , renovating and strengthening management .

Currently , the State Council is researching *RNR*-70 and laying *RNR*-70 down specific plans and policies for the 3 - year state - owned enterprise reform .

When *PRO* rebuilding state - owned enterprises into limited companies and stock companies with multiple principle investments and reasonable stock rights structure *T*-71 , and when *PRO* using capital as the link for *PRO* structuring parent - subsidiary corporate systems *PRO* to smooth out reasonable internal group relations *T*-72 , we need *-73 to prevent administrative " mandatory matching " and " *PRO* arbitrarily creating piles " .
The development of a number of large companies and large groups *ICH*-74 through purchase , merger and alliance that *T*-96 would combine industry , technology and trade and would operate across regions , across industries , across systems of ownership and across countries needs *-75 to be encouraged *-75 .

When *PRO* talking about rural system reform *T*-97 , <COREF ID="11716" TYPE="IDENT">Tieying Li</COREF> stressed that the household - factory contract responsibility system needs *-82 to persist *PRO*-82 unchanged for a long time , a system of land rights and compensated circulation needs *-84 to be actively sought *-84 and established and land scaled operations need *-86 to be promoted *-86 .
Through reform , a grain circulation system with a clear division of central and local responsibilities and rights which *T*-88 would be under national macroscopic control and would meet the needs of <COREF ID="11749" TYPE="IDENT">the socialist market economy</COREF> and would suit the national situation needs *-89 to be gradually established *-89 .
Through *PRO* implementing industrialized agricultural operations , peasants ' income and local fiscal revenues should be increased *-91 and new economic growth spots should be cultivated *-92 .
