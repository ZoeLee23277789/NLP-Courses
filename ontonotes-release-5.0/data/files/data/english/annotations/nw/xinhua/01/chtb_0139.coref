In <COREF ID="23840" TYPE="IDENT">1997</COREF> , <COREF ID="23843" TYPE="IDENT">Mexico 's</COREF> total amount of foreign trade broke through 220 billion US dollars , which *T*-26 created a new historical record .
However , in *PRO* reviewing <COREF ID="23849" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="23843" TYPE="IDENT">Mexico 's</COREF> foreign trade situation</COREF> <COREF ID="chtb_139-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> , it *EXP*-37 might be appropriate *PRO* to say that <COREF ID="23849" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is between joy and sorrow .
The joy lies in that the total amount of foreign trade still maintains a strong growth momentum , and has realized trade surpluses for the third year in a row , whereas the sorrow is that the amount of trade surplus has sharply reversed , and <COREF ID="chtb_139-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> , a relatively large deficit may appear .
According to official journals published * recently by <COREF ID="23843" TYPE="IDENT">Mexico 's</COREF> Treasury Department , <COREF ID="23843" TYPE="IDENT">Mexico 's</COREF> foreign trade in <COREF ID="23840" TYPE="IDENT">1997</COREF> continued *-42 to grow rapidly , <COREF ID="23882" TYPE="IDENT">the total amount of imports and exports</COREF> reached 220.178 billion US dollars , 18.85 % higher than that of <COREF ID="23889" TYPE="IDENT">the previous year</COREF> , and within <COREF ID="23882" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> the amount of exports was 110.380 billion US dollars , the amount of imports was 109.798 billion US dollars , *PRO* 15 % and 22.7 % higher than <COREF ID="23889" TYPE="IDENT">1996</COREF> , respectively .
The trade surplus was 582 million US dollars .
Foreign trade occupies a pivotal position in <COREF ID="23843" TYPE="IDENT">Mexico 's</COREF> economy .
At present , exports account for more than 30 % of its GDP , which *T*-29 is one of the primary economic growth forces .
After the outbreak of <COREF ID="23843" TYPE="IDENT">Mexico 's</COREF> financial crisis in <COREF ID="23922" TYPE="IDENT">1994</COREF> , <COREF ID="23926" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="23843" TYPE="IDENT">Mexico 's</COREF> currency</COREF> , <COREF ID="23926" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the peso</COREF> was greatly devalued *-30 , *PRO* thus greatly strengthening <COREF ID="23843" TYPE="IDENT">Mexico 's</COREF> export competitiveness .
In the last several years , the government has been vigorously supporting exports , and exports grew rapidly .
In <COREF ID="23935" TYPE="IDENT">1995</COREF> , the situation of successive foreign trade deficit reversed , and up to now , has maintained trade surpluses for three years in a row .
However , in the past three years , <COREF ID="23843" TYPE="IDENT">Mexico 's</COREF> foreign trade surplus showed a substantial degradation : 7.889 billion US dollars in <COREF ID="23935" TYPE="IDENT">1995</COREF> , 6.424 billion US dollars in <COREF ID="23889" TYPE="IDENT">1996</COREF> , and only 582 million US dollars <COREF ID="23840" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> .
Especially deserving *PRO*-44 to be pointed *-44 out is *T*-43 that , after the first monthly deficit in <COREF ID="23962" TYPE="IDENT">July</COREF> <COREF ID="23840" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> , the rest of <COREF ID="23840" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF> saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling , roaring from 20 million US dollars in <COREF ID="23962" TYPE="IDENT">July</COREF> to 722 million US dollars in December , *PRO* reducing the <COREF ID="23840" TYPE="IDENT">1997</COREF> annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number .
Local economic analysts felt that the trade deficit in the second half of <COREF ID="23840" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> was mainly due to an overly high import growth rate , which *T*-33 is even higher than that of exports .
In the second half of <COREF ID="23840" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> , the average growth rate of imports was 6 % to 7 % higher than that of exports .
Among import sectors , swift growth comes mainly from imports of consumer products and capital goods , 39.9 % and 38.2 % higher than that of <COREF ID="23889" TYPE="IDENT">1996</COREF> respectively .
The growth of imports of semi-finished products was up by 18.8 % .
Secondly , the overly high valuation of the peso is also an indispensable factor .
An overly high peso exchange rate stimulated imports , but hindered exports .
It *EXP*-45 is commonly known *-34 that in <COREF ID="23922" TYPE="IDENT">1994</COREF> , before the outbreak of the financial crisis , the trade deficit was once as high as more than 18 billion US dollars .
The huge trade deficit was one of the internal reasons that *T*-35 triggered this crisis .
Hence , the trade situation <COREF ID="23840" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF> has caused extreme concern among <COREF ID="24049" TYPE="IDENT">people from economic circles , who *T*-36 even predicted that in <COREF ID="chtb_139-E2" TYPE="IDENT">1998</COREF> , foreign trade deficit would revive</COREF> .
<COREF ID="24049" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> pointed out that , <COREF ID="chtb_139-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> , except for an overly high peso exchange rate , exports would also face some new unfavorable factors .
For instance , Asian currency devaluation will decrease export competitiveness , and the fall of oil price will significantly reduce oil revenues .
Under these circumstances , if the import growth momentum can not be restrained *-46 , <COREF ID="chtb_139-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> , a trade deficit of 4 to 5 billion US dollars may appear .
