<COREF ID="15751" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15752" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jiaju Hou</COREF> , <COREF ID="15752" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> economist</COREF> ,</COREF> published an article with the title " Three comments on ' *PRO* do n't rush , be patient ' " in <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> " Daily Economy " on Monday , *PRO*-1 pointing out that <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> authorities ' adopting a " *PRO* do n't rush , be patient " restriction policy for <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> businessmen investing in <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> mainland</COREF> would give rise to many abuses .
<COREF ID="15751" TYPE="IDENT">Jiaju Hou</COREF> points out that <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> authorities say that " *PRO* do n't rush , be patient " is *PRO* to restrict large - sized <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> companies from *PRO* going to <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> mainland</COREF> *PRO* to invest and would have no impact on medium - and small - sized companies , but this is actually not the case .
Currently , <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> authorities define medium - and small - sized companies as *PRO* having capital of under 60 million <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> dollars , but actually <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> current medium - and small - sized companies mostly have significant scale .
*PRO* Taking <COREF ID="15798" TYPE="IDENT">medium and small - sized companies listed * last year</COREF> as top ten for example , the smallest net operating revenue of <COREF ID="15798" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> was 3.365 billion <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> dollars , the highest reached 10 billion <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> dollars .
Obviously , *PRO* implementing <COREF ID="15879" TYPE="IDENT">a " *PRO* do n't rush , be patient " policy</COREF> will result in *PRO* losing many business opportunities in <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> mainland</COREF> for no reason .
<COREF ID="15751" TYPE="IDENT">Jiaju Hou</COREF> believed that <COREF ID="15879" TYPE="IDENT">the " *PRO* do n't rush , be patient " policy</COREF> would also have influence on exports to <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> mainland</COREF> .
Because , among exports from <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> to <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> mainland</COREF> , a large portion are due to <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> businessmen investing in *PRO* setting up factories in <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> mainland</COREF> and needing *-1 to ship spare parts for machines and equipment and intermediate raw materials .
In recent years , <COREF ID="15845" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> trade surplus with <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> mainland</COREF></COREF> has accumulatively reached 80 billion US dollars , which *T*-2 is almost the same as <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan 's</COREF> foreign currency reserve .
While the financial storm shows no sign of relief today , the importance of <COREF ID="15845" TYPE="IDENT">this surplus</COREF> is more and more obvious .
How can <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> <COREF ID="15873" TYPE="IDENT">decrease</COREF> exports to <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> mainland</COREF> for the sake of " *PRO* do n't rush , be patient " *T*-4 ?
Because <COREF ID="15873" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> will reduce <COREF ID="15845" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> trade surplus with <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> mainland</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="15751" TYPE="IDENT">Jiaju Hou</COREF> pointed out that <COREF ID="15879" TYPE="IDENT">the " * do n't rush , be patient " policy</COREF> would also restrain foreign businessmen from *PRO* investing in <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
Because most foreign businessmen investing in <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> want *PRO*-3 to take this opportunity *PRO* to jointly invest in <COREF ID="15770" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15771" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> mainland</COREF> with <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> investments .
Therefore , <COREF ID="15879" TYPE="IDENT">this policy</COREF> , while *PRO* blocking the development of local enterprises , will also limit foreign businessmen 's wishes *PRO* to invest in <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> .
It *EXP*-6 is reported *-7 that <COREF ID="15751" TYPE="IDENT">Jiaju Hou</COREF> has successively published 3 articles in <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> newspapers on <COREF ID="15879" TYPE="IDENT">the " *PRO* do n't rush , be patient " policy</COREF> , *PRO* pointing out to <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> authorities that <COREF ID="15879" TYPE="IDENT">this erroneous mainland economic and trade policy</COREF> violates the " basic philosophy of free economy " , and hopes that <COREF ID="15762" TYPE="IDENT">Taiwan</COREF> authorities " are warned *-5 of the consequences " .
