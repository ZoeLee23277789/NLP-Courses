    The joy lies in that the total amount of foreign trade still maintains a strong growth momentum, and has realized trade
    surpluses for the third year in a row, whereas the sorrow is that the amount of trade surplus has sharply reversed, and
    this year, a relatively large deficit may appear.

    saw successive monthly deficits with the amounts of deficit almost doubling, roaring from 20 million US dollars in July
    to 722 million US dollars in December, reducing the 1997 annual accumulative trade surplus amount to a trivial number.
