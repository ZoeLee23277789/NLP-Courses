Russian troops held the last ceremony 0 *T*-18 to bid farewell to <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> on the 31st .
Soldiers from three countries , namely , the <COREF ID="38452" TYPE="IDENT">US</COREF> , <COREF ID="38453" TYPE="IDENT">UK</COREF> and <COREF ID="38393" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF> will also withdraw from <COREF ID="38394" TYPE="IDENT">Berlin</COREF> in early September .
The occupying armies existing in German territory will end soon .
On September 1st , 1939 , Hitler 's army attacked Poland .
It has just been 55 years now since <COREF ID="38405" TYPE="IDENT">the Second World War II which *T*-19 brought great suffering to the people of <COREF ID="38412" TYPE="IDENT">Europe</COREF> and the world</COREF> .
<COREF ID="38414" TYPE="IDENT">A total of four million people from European countries</COREF> died in <COREF ID="38405" TYPE="IDENT">this war</COREF> , including those from <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> .
Among <COREF ID="38414" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , <COREF ID="38424" TYPE="IDENT">the USSR</COREF> made a great sacrifice in <COREF ID="38405" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> *PRO*-20 to win over German invaders .
<COREF ID="38424" TYPE="IDENT">Its</COREF> casualties were nearly 28 million .
Half a century has passed in a flash , with <COREF ID="38412" TYPE="IDENT">Europe</COREF> experiencing hot war , cold war , turmoil and tremendous changes .
Currently , both the hot and cold wars have passed , but the end of turmoil and conflict is not *PRO* yet to be seen * .
In the early period after <COREF ID="38405" TYPE="IDENT">the war</COREF> , <COREF ID="38448" TYPE="IDENT">the four large countries , namely <COREF ID="38424" TYPE="IDENT">the USSR</COREF> , <COREF ID="38452" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> , <COREF ID="38453" TYPE="IDENT">the UK</COREF> and <COREF ID="38393" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF></COREF> , carved out <COREF ID="38448" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> spheres of influence in accordance with the " Yalta agreement " , and occupied <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> and <COREF ID="38394" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> capital</COREF> by districts .
The highest policy - making authorities in <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> then were the " Control Committee of the Allied States " .
Henceforth , <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> was split *-22 up and in a powerless state for a long period .
Not long after , the contest between <COREF ID="38452" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> and <COREF ID="38424" TYPE="IDENT">the USSR</COREF> in <COREF ID="38412" TYPE="IDENT">Europe</COREF> caused a split in the original anti-fascist coalition , *PRO*-23 resulting in <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">German 's</COREF> division into two .
On the western side , <COREF ID="38452" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> organized NATO and supported West Germany for the purpose of *PRO* keeping <COREF ID="38424" TYPE="IDENT">the USSR</COREF> " in check " ; on the eastern side , <COREF ID="38424" TYPE="IDENT">the USSR</COREF> organized <COREF ID="38500" TYPE="IDENT">the Warsaw Pact</COREF> , and built up East Germany as the bridgehead against the West .
<COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> , being split * up , became the frontline of the cold - war confrontation between the East and West .
Henceforth , there has not been a single day of peace in the political situation of <COREF ID="38412" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38521" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Europe</COREF> , <COREF ID="38521" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a crisis - ridden continent</COREF></COREF> .
But , since the start of 1989 , a new turn has occurred in the European situation .
Radical changes in Eastern Europe , the re-unification of <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> , the dissolution of <COREF ID="38500" TYPE="IDENT">the Warsaw Pact</COREF> and the disintegration of <COREF ID="38424" TYPE="IDENT">the USSR</COREF> all occurred successively , *PRO* causing difficulties in *PRO* continuing the original " Yalta system " .
In this great change , <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> became the largest beneficiary .
The rise of a re-unified Germany has changed the proportion of strength in <COREF ID="38412" TYPE="IDENT">Europe</COREF> , *PRO*-24 making <COREF ID="38453" TYPE="IDENT">the UK</COREF> and <COREF ID="38393" TYPE="IDENT">France</COREF> , which *T*-28 originally were large world powers , worry about *PRO* dropping to second - class big countries .
<COREF ID="38452" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="38566" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The US</COREF> <COREF ID="38566" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">, the only superpower today ,</COREF></COREF> has recently started *-30 to regard <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> as a " partner in leadership " , *PRO*-30 encouraging <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 to " exercise a leadership role " in world politics .
The reason is obvious : <COREF ID="38452" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> wants *PRO*-32 to make use of <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany 's</COREF> strength .
A unified Germany is moving today from a large economic country to a large political country .
*PRO* Depending on <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own tremendous strength , <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">Germany</COREF> is playing a leading role in the European Union , and <COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> role as a " giant " is obviously seen *-34 by common people .
<COREF ID="38384" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> spares no efforts in *PRO* playing a " bridging role " between eastern and western Europe and participating in the " peacekeeping mission " under the banner of <COREF ID="38607" TYPE="IDENT">the United Nations</COREF> , and is striving *PRO*-35 to be a permanent member country of the <COREF ID="38607" TYPE="IDENT">United Nations</COREF> Security Council .
Currently , the historical post-war period is drawing to an end .
But <COREF ID="38615" TYPE="IDENT">the lesson of blood and tears</COREF> and the painful experience 0 <COREF ID="38615" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> left *T*-36 for later generations still needs *-38 to continue and earnestly conclude .
