    It can be said that Gong Li gives a poignant portrayal in the movie of the Empress, a character full of emotion and
    bitterness, while Jay Chou's portrayal of the second prince as he leads his soldiers in a " rebellion plot, " even
    though the plot ultimately fails, is nevertheless moving and tragic.
