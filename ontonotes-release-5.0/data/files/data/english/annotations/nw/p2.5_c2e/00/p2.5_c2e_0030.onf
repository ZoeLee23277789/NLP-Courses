Plain sentence:

    Currently, in areas like Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Gansu, and Xinjiang, employers no longer directly pay the heating bills
    ; instead, work units would distribute special subsidies to their employees, who would then pay their own heating
    expenses ; hence, the reform of heating bill payment has changed from an " implicit subsidy " to an " explicit subsidy "
    system.
