<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> looked up and saw <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">some rich people</COREF> putting <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> gifts to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> into <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Temple</COREF> collection box</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> saw <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">a poor widow</COREF> put <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">two small copper coins</COREF> into <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the box</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said , `` <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">This poor widow</COREF> gave <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">only two small coins</COREF> .
But the truth is , 0 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> gave more than <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">all those rich people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have plenty , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> gave only what <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did not need *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">This woman</COREF> is very poor , but <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> gave all 0 <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had 0 *PRO* to live on *T*-2 . ''
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">Some of the followers</COREF> were talking about <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the Temple</COREF> .
<COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> said , `` <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is a beautiful Temple , built with the best stones .
*PRO* Look at the many good gifts that *T*-1 have been offered *-2 to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> . ''
But <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> said , `` The time *ICH*-1 will come when all that you see *T*-4 here will be destroyed *-3 *T*-2 .
Every stone of these buildings will be thrown *-1 down to the ground .
Not one stone will be left *-1 on another . ''
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Some followers</COREF> asked <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Teacher</COREF> , when will <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">these things</COREF> happen *T*-1 ?
What *T*-1 will show <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> that it is time 0 for <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">these things</COREF> to happen *T*-2 ? ''
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> said , `` *PRO* Be careful !
*PRO* Do n't be fooled *-1 .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Many people</COREF> will come *PRO*-1 using <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> name .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will say , ' <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the Christ</COREF> ' and ' The right time has come ! '
But *PRO* do n't follow <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
When <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> hear about <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">wars and riots</COREF> *T*-1 , *PRO* do n't be afraid .
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">These things</COREF> must happen first .
Then the end will come later . ''
Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> said to <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , `` Nations will fight against other nations .
Kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms .
There will be great earthquakes , sicknesses , and other bad things in many places .
In some places there will be no food 0 for the people to eat *T*-1 .
Terrible things will happen , and amazing things will come from heaven *PRO* to warn people .
`` But before all these things happen , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> will arrest <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> and do bad things to <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will judge <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> synagogues and put <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> in jail .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> will be forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to stand before kings and governors .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will do all these things to <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> because <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> follow <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
But this will give <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> an opportunity *PRO* to tell about <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
*PRO* Decide now *PRO*-1 not to worry about what <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will say *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will give <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> the wisdom *PRO* to say things that none of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> enemies can answer *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">Even <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> parents , brothers , relatives , and friends</COREF> will turn against <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will have some of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> killed *-1 .
Everyone will hate <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> because <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> follow <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
But none of <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">these things</COREF> can really harm <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> will save <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">yourselves</COREF> by *PRO* continuing *PRO*-2 strong in <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> faith through <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">all these things</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> will see armies all around <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Jerusalem</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will know that <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">the time for <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> destruction</COREF> has come .
The people in Judea at <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">that time</COREF> should run away to the mountains .
The people in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">Jerusalem</COREF> must leave quickly .
If <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are near <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> , *PRO* do n't go in !
The prophets wrote many things about the time when <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> will punish <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> people *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">The time 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am talking about *T*-1</COREF> is when all these things must happen *T*-2 .
During <COREF ID="137" TYPE="IDENT">that time</COREF> , it will be hard for women who *T*-1 are pregnant or have small babies , because very bad times will come to this land .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> will be angry with <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> .
Some of <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> will be killed *-1 by soldiers .
Others will be made *-1 prisoners and taken *-1 to all the different countries .
<COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">The holy city of Jerusalem</COREF> will be under the control of <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">foreigners</COREF> until <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> time is completed *-1 .
`` Amazing things will happen to the sun , moon , and stars .
And <COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">people all over <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF></COREF> will be upset and confused *-1 by the noise of <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">the sea</COREF> and <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> crashing waves .
<COREF ID="179" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will be afraid and worried about what *T*-1 will happen to <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> .
Everything in the sky will be changed *-1 .
Then people will see <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the Son of Man</COREF> coming in a cloud with power and great glory .
When <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">these things</COREF> begin *-2 to happen *T*-1 , *PRO* stand up *PRO*-3 tall and do n't be afraid .
*PRO* Know that it is almost time 0 for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> to free <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *T*-1 ! ''
Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> told this story : `` *PRO* Look at all the trees .
<COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">The fig tree</COREF> is a good example .
When <COREF ID="205" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> turns green *T*-1 , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know that summer is near .
In the same way , when <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> see <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">all these things</COREF> happening *T*-1 , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will know that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> kingdom is coming very soon .
`` <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> assure <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> that <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">all these things</COREF> will happen while some of the people of this time are still living .
<COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="223" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">The whole world</COREF> , <COREF ID="223" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">earth and sky</COREF></COREF> , will be destroyed *-1 , but <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> words will last forever .
`` *PRO* Be careful *PRO* not to <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">spend</COREF> <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> time *PRO*-1 having parties and getting drunk or worrying about this life .
If <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> wo n't be able *PRO*-1 to think straight , and <COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">the end</COREF> might come when <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are not ready *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="234" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> will come as a surprise to everyone on <COREF ID="187" TYPE="IDENT">earth</COREF> .
So *PRO* be ready all the time .
*PRO* Pray that <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will be able *PRO* to get through <COREF ID="197" TYPE="IDENT">all these things that *T*-2 will happen</COREF> and stand *PRO*-1 safe before <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the Son of Man</COREF> . ''
During the day <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> taught the people in the <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Temple</COREF> area .
At night <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went out of <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> and stayed all night on the Mount of Olives .
Every morning all the people got up early *PRO*-1 to go *PRO*-2 listen to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> at <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">the Temple</COREF> .
