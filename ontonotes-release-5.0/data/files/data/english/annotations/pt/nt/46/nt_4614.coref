Love should be the goal of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> life , but <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> should also want *PRO*-1 to have the gifts that *T*-2 come from <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Spirit</COREF> .
And the gift 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> should want *T*-1 most is *PRO* to be able *PRO* to prophesy .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will explain why .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Those who *T*-1 have the gift of *PRO* speaking in a different language</COREF> are not speaking to people .
<COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are speaking to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
No one understands <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> -- <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are speaking secret things through <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the Spirit</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-1 prophesy</COREF> are speaking to people .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> help people grow stronger in faith , and <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> give encouragement and comfort .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Those who *T*-1 speak in a different language</COREF> are helping <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">only themselves</COREF> .
But those who *T*-1 prophesy are helping <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the whole church</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would like <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">all of <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF></COREF> to have the gift of *PRO* speaking in different languages .
But what <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *T*-1 more is for <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to prophesy .
Anyone who *T*-1 prophesies is more important than <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-2 can only speak in <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">different languages</COREF></COREF> .
However , if <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can also interpret <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">those languages</COREF> , <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are as important as the one who *T*-1 prophesies .
If <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can interpret , then <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the church</COREF> can be helped *-1 by what <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">Brothers and sisters</COREF> , will it *EXP*-1 help <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> if <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> come to <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *PRO*-2 speaking in different languages ?
No , it will help <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> only if <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> bring <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> a new truth or some knowledge , prophecy , or teaching .
This is true even with lifeless things that *T*-1 make sounds -- like a flute or a harp .
If the different musical notes are not made *-1 clear , <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ca n't understand what song *T*-2 is being played *-3 .
Each note must be played *-1 clearly for <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to be able *PRO* to understand the tune .
And in a war , if the trumpet does not sound clearly , the soldiers will not know 0 it is time 0 *PRO* to prepare for *PRO* fighting *T*-1 .
It is the same with <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do n't speak clearly in a language 0 <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> know *T*-1 , <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can not understand what <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are saying *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> will be talking to the air !
It *EXP*-1 is true that there are <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">many different languages</COREF> in the world , and <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">they <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> have meaning .
But if <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't understand the meaning of what <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">someone</COREF> is saying *T*-1 , it will just be strange sounds to <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , and <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will sound just as strange to <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
That 's why you who *T*-2 want spiritual gifts so much should prefer those gifts that *T*-3 help <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the church</COREF> grow stronger *T*-1 .
So <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-1 have the gift of *PRO* speaking in a different language</COREF> should pray that <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can also interpret what <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say *T*-2 .
If <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> pray in a different language , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> spirit</COREF> is praying , but <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> mind</COREF> does nothing .
So what should <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will pray with <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> spirit</COREF> , but <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will also pray with <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> mind</COREF> .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will sing with <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> spirit</COREF> , but <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will also sing with <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> mind</COREF> .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> might be praising <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> with <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> spirit .
But <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">someone there without understanding</COREF> can not say `` Amen '' to <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> prayer of thanks , because <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't know what <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are saying *T*-1 .

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> may be thanking <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> in a good way , but others are not helped *-1 .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> thank <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> gift of *PRO* speaking in different kinds of languages is greater than any of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">yours</COREF> .
But in the church meetings <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would rather *ICH*-2 speak five words that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> understand *T*-1 than thousands of words in a different language .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would rather speak with <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> understanding , so that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can teach others .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Brothers and sisters</COREF> , *PRO* do n't think like children .
In evil things *PRO* be like babies , but in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> thinking <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> should be like full - grown adults .
As the Scriptures say , `` *PRO*-2 Using those who *T*-1 speak a different language and using the lips of foreigners , <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will speak to <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> .
But even then , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will not obey <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is what <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> says *T*-1 .
And from <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> we see that the use of different languages shows how <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> deals with those who *T*-2 do n't believe , not with those who *T*-3 believe *T*-1 .
And prophecy shows how <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> works through those who *T*-2 believe , not through unbelievers *T*-1 .
*PRO* Suppose 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the whole church</COREF> meets together and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> speak in different languages .
If <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">some people *EXP*-1</COREF> come in who *T*-2 are without understanding or do n't believe , <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will say 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are crazy .
But *PRO* suppose 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are all prophesying and <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">someone *ICH*-1</COREF> comes in who *T*-2 does not believe or who *T*-3 is without understanding .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> sin will be shown *-1 to <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , and <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will be judged *-2 by everything 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> say *T*-3 .
The secret things in <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> heart will be made *-1 known .
So <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will bow down and worship <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will say , `` Without a doubt , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> is here with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> . ''
So , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">brothers and sisters</COREF> , what should <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do *T*-1 ?
When <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> meet together *T*-1 , one person has a song , another has a teaching , and another has a new truth from <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
One person speaks in <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">a different language</COREF> , and another interprets <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">that language</COREF> .
The purpose of whatever <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do *T*-1 should be *PRO* to help everyone grow stronger in faith .
When <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> meet together *T*-1 , if anyone <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">speaks</COREF> to the group in a different language , it should be <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">only two or no more than three people who *T*-2 do <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF></COREF> .
And <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should speak one after the other .
And someone else should interpret what <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say *T*-1 .
But if there is no interpreter , then <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">anyone who *T*-1 speaks in a different language</COREF> should be quiet in the church meeting .
<COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> should speak only to <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> and to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">only two or three prophets</COREF> should speak .
The others should judge what <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say *T*-1 .
And if a message from <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> comes to someone who *T*-1 is sitting , the first speaker should be quiet .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> can all prophesy one after the other .
This way everyone can be taught and encouraged *-1 .
The spirits of <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">prophets</COREF> are under the control of <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">the prophets <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> is not a God of confusion but a God of peace .
This is the rule for <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">all the meetings of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">The women</COREF> should keep quiet in <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">these church meetings</COREF> .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are not allowed *-1 to speak out but should be under authority , as the Law of Moses says .
If there is something 0 <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-2 to know *T*-1 , <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should ask <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own husbands at home .
It *EXP*-1 is shameful for a woman to speak up like that in the church meeting .
<COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> teaching</COREF> did not come from <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are not the only ones who *T*-1 have received <COREF ID="167" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are a prophet or that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have a spiritual gift , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> should understand that what <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am writing *T*-1 to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> is <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord 's</COREF> command</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do not accept <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will not be accepted *-1 .
So <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> brothers and sisters</COREF> , *PRO* continue *-1 to give <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> attention to *PRO* prophesying .
And *PRO* do n't stop anyone from *PRO* using the gift of *PRO* speaking in different languages .
But everything should be done *-1 in a way that *T*-2 is right and orderly .
