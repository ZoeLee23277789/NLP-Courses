Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was given *-1 a measuring rod as long as a walking stick .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was told *-1 , `` *PRO* Go and measure <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the temple of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF></COREF> and the altar , and count the people worshiping there .
But *PRO* do n't measure <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the yard outside <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the temple</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* Leave <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 alone .
<COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has been given *-1 to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-2 are not <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will show <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> power over the holy city for 42 months .
And <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will give power to <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> two witnesses</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will prophesy for 1260 days .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will be dressed in sackcloth . ''
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">These two witnesses</COREF> are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that *T*-1 stand before <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF></COREF> .
If anyone tries *PRO*-1 to hurt <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the witnesses</COREF> , fire comes from the mouths of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the witnesses</COREF> and kills <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> enemies .
Anyone who *T*-1 tries *PRO*-2 to hurt <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> will die like this .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">These witnesses</COREF> have the power *PRO* to stop the sky from *PRO* raining during the time 0 <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are prophesying *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">These witnesses</COREF> have power *PRO* to make the water become blood .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have power *PRO* to <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">send</COREF> every kind of plague to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> can do <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> as many times as <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want .
When <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the two witnesses</COREF> have finished *PRO*-2 telling <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> message *T*-1 , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the beast</COREF> will fight against <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is the beast that *T*-1 comes up from the bottomless pit .
<COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> will defeat and kill <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">The bodies of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the two witnesses</COREF></COREF> will lie in the street of <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the great city</COREF> .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">This city</COREF> is named *-1 *PRO*-2 <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">Sodom and Egypt</COREF> .
<COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">These names for <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF></COREF> have a special meaning .
<COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is the city where <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> was killed *-2 *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">People from every race of people , tribe , language , and nation</COREF> will look at <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the bodies of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the two witnesses</COREF></COREF> for three and a half days .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">The people</COREF> will refuse *PRO*-1 to bury <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">Everyone on <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF></COREF> will be happy because <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">these two</COREF> are dead .
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will have parties and *PRO* send each other gifts .
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will do this because <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">these two prophets</COREF> brought much suffering to <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the people living on <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">earth</COREF></COREF> .
But after three and a half days , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> let life enter <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the two witnesses</COREF> again .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> stood on <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> feet .
All those who *T*-2 saw <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> were filled *-1 with fear .
Then <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the two witnesses</COREF> heard a loud voice from <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">heaven</COREF> say , `` *PRO* Come up here ! ''
And <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">both of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> went up into <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">heaven</COREF> in a cloud .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> enemies watched <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 go .
At that same time there was <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">a great earthquake</COREF> .
A tenth of <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> was destroyed *-1 .
And 7000 people were killed *-1 in <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">the earthquake</COREF> .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">Those who *T*-1 did not die</COREF> were very afraid .
<COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> gave glory to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the God of <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">heaven</COREF></COREF> .
The second terror is now past .
The third terror is coming soon .
<COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">The seventh angel</COREF> blew <COREF ID="141" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> trumpet .
Then there were <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">loud voices in <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">heaven</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">The voices</COREF> said , `` The kingdom of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> has now become the kingdom of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> Lord</COREF> and of <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> Christ</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will rule forever and ever . ''
Then <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the 24 elders</COREF> bowed down on <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> faces and worshiped <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
These are <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the elders who *T*-1 sit on <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> thrones before <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">The elders</COREF> said , `` <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> give thanks to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Lord God All - Powerful</COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are the one who *T*-1 is and who *T*-2 always was .
<COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> thank <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> because <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have used <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> great power and have begun *-1 to rule .
The people of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> were angry , but now is *T*-1 the time for <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> anger .
Now is *T*-1 the time 0 for the dead to be judged *-3 *T*-2 .
It is time 0 *PRO* to reward <COREF ID="187" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> servants</COREF> , <COREF ID="187" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the prophets</COREF> , and to reward <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> holy people , the people , great and small , who *T*-2 respect <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *T*-1 .
It is time 0 *PRO* to destroy those people who *T*-2 destroy <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> *T*-1 ! ''
Then <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> temple in <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">heaven</COREF></COREF> was opened *-1 .
The Box of the Agreement could be seen *-1 in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> temple</COREF> .
Then there were flashes of lightning , noises , thunder , an earthquake , and a great hailstorm .
