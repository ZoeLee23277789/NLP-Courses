Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> looked , and there before <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> was *T*-1 an open door in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">heaven</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> heard <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the same voice that *T*-1 spoke to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> before</COREF> .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was the voice that *T*-1 sounded like a trumpet .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> said , `` *PRO* Come up here , and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will show <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> what *T*-1 must happen after this . ''
Immediately the Spirit took control of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , and there in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">heaven</COREF> was *T*-1 <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">a throne with <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">someone sitting on <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">The one sitting there</COREF> was as beautiful as precious stones , like jasper and carnelian .
All around <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF> was *T*-1 a rainbow with clear colors like an emerald .
In a circle around <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF> were *T*-1 <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">24 other thrones with <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">24 elders sitting on <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">The elders</COREF> were dressed *-1 in white , and <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">golden crowns</COREF> on <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> heads .
Lightning flashes and noises of thunder came from <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF> .
Before <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF> there were seven lamps burning , which *T*-1 are the seven Spirits of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
Also before <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF> there was something that *T*-1 looked like a sea of glass , as clear as crystal .
In front of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF> and on each side of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> there were <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">four living beings</COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> had eyes all over <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , in front and in back .
The first living being was like a lion .
The second was like a bull .
The third had a face like a man .
The fourth was like a flying eagle .
Each of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">these four living beings</COREF> had six wings .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were covered *-1 all over with eyes , inside and out .
Day and night <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> never stopped *-1 saying , `` Holy , holy , holy is *T*-2 <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord God All - Powerful</COREF> .
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> always was , <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is , and <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is coming . ''
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">These living beings</COREF> were giving glory and honor and thanks to <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the one who *T*-1 sits on <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="92" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the one who *T*-2 lives forever and ever</COREF></COREF> .
And every time 0 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did this *T*-1 , <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the 24 elders</COREF> bowed down before <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">the one who *T*-2 sits on <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> worshiped <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">him who *T*-1 lives forever and ever</COREF> .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> put <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> crowns</COREF> down before <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF> and said , `` <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> Lord and God</COREF> !
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are worthy *PRO*-1 to receive glory and honor and power .
<COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> made all things .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">Everything</COREF> existed and was made *-1 because <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> wanted <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> . ''
