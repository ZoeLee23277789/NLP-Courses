<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Faith</COREF> is what *T*-1 makes real the things 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> hope for *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is proof of what <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can not see *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> was pleased with <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the people who *T*-1 lived a long time ago</COREF> because <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had faith like this .
Faith helps <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> understand that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">created</COREF> the whole world by <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> command .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> means that the things 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> see *T*-2 were made *-1 by something that *T*-3 can not be seen *-4 .
<COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">Cain and Abel <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">both</COREF></COREF> offered sacrifices to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Abel</COREF> offered a better sacrifice to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> because <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was pleased with what <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Abel</COREF> offered *T*-1 .
And so <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> called <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> a good man because <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith .
<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Abel</COREF> died , but through <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> faith <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is still speaking .
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Enoch</COREF> was carried *-1 away from <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">this earth</COREF> , so <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> never died .
The Scriptures tell <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> that before <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was carried *-1 off , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was a man who *T*-2 pleased <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
Later , no one knew where <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was *T*-1 , because <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> had taken <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">Enoch</COREF> *PRO*-2 to be with <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">This <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> happened because <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith .
Without faith no one can please <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
Whoever *T*-1 comes to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> must believe that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is real and that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> rewards those who *T*-2 sincerely try *PRO*-3 to find <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Noah</COREF> was warned *-1 by <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> about things that <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could not yet see *T*-2 .
But <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith and respect for <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> , so <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> built a large boat *PRO*-1 to save <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> family .
With <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> faith , <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">Noah</COREF> showed that the world was wrong .
And <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> became one of those who *T*-1 are made *-2 right with <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> through faith .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> called <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> *PRO*-1 to travel to <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">another place that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> promised *PRO*-3 to give <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-2</COREF> .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> did not know where <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">that other place</COREF> was *T*-1 .
But <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> obeyed <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> and started *-1 traveling because <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> lived in <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the country that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> promised *PRO*-2 to give <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">lived</COREF> there like a visitor who *T*-1 did not belong .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> because <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> lived in tents with Isaac and Jacob , who *T*-1 also received the same promise from <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> was waiting for <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the city that *T*-1 has real foundations</COREF> .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was waiting for <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the city that *T*-1 is planned and built *-2 by <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF></COREF> .
Sarah was not able *PRO*-1 to have children , and <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> was too old .
But <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith in <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> , *PRO*-1 trusting <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 to do what <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> promised *T*-3 .
And so <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> made them able *PRO* to have children .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> was so old 0 <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was almost dead .
But from <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">that one man</COREF> came *T*-1 as many descendants as there are stars in the sky .
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">So many *ICH*-1 people</COREF> came from <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are like grains of sand on the seashore .
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">All these great people</COREF> continued *-1 living with faith until <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> died .
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> did not get <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the things 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> promised <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> people *T*-1</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were happy *PRO*-1 just to see <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">those promises</COREF> coming far in the future .
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> accepted <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">the fact that <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were like visitors and strangers here on <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">earth</COREF></COREF> .
When <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> accept something like <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> show 0 <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are waiting for a country that *T*-2 will be <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own .
If <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were thinking about the country 0 <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had left *T*-1 , <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could have gone back .
But <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were waiting for <COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a better country</COREF> -- <COREF ID="179" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a heavenly country</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> is not ashamed *PRO* to be called *-1 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> God</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has prepared a city for <COREF ID="164" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> tested <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham 's</COREF> faith .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> told <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 to offer <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Isaac</COREF> as a sacrifice .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> obeyed because <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> already had the promises from <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> had already said to <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , `` It is through <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Isaac</COREF> 0 that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> descendants will come *T*-1 . ''
But <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> ready *PRO*-1 to offer <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> only son</COREF> .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did <COREF ID="209" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> because <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> believed that <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> could raise people from death .
And really , when <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> stopped <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> from *PRO* killing <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Isaac</COREF> *T*-1 , it was as if <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> got <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> back from death .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">Isaac</COREF> <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">blessed</COREF> the future of Jacob and Esau .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did <COREF ID="227" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> because <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith .
And <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">Jacob</COREF> , also because <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith , <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">blessed</COREF> each one of <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">Joseph 's</COREF> sons .
<COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> while <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was dying , *PRO*-1 leaning on <COREF ID="230" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> rod and worshiping <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
And when <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">Joseph</COREF> was almost dead *T*-1 , <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> spoke about <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">the people of Israel</COREF> leaving Egypt .
And <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> told <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> what <COREF ID="244" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should do *T*-1 with <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> body .
<COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did this because <COREF ID="235" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had faith .
And <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">the mother and father of <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">Moses</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="262" TYPE="IDENT">hid</COREF> <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> for three months after <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was born *-1 .
<COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> did <COREF ID="262" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> because <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had faith .
<COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> saw that <COREF ID="257" TYPE="IDENT">Moses</COREF> was a beautiful baby .
And <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were not afraid *PRO* to disobey the king 's order .

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Moses</COREF> grew up and became a man .

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Moses</COREF> prepared the Passover and spread the blood on the doorways of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the people of Israel</COREF> , so that the angel of death would not kill <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> firstborn sons .

<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> marched around <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the walls</COREF> for seven days , and then <COREF ID="66" TYPE="IDENT">the walls</COREF> fell .
