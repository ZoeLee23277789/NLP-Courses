The day after the Sabbath day was the first day of the week .
That day at dawn <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Mary Magdalene and the other woman named * *PRO*-2 Mary</COREF> went *PRO*-1 to look at <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the tomb</COREF> .
Suddenly <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">an angel of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF></COREF> came from the sky , and there was a huge earthquake .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The angel</COREF> went to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the tomb</COREF> and rolled <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the stone</COREF> away from the entrance .
Then <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> sat on top of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the stone</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The angel</COREF> was shining *PRO*-1 as bright as lightning .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> clothes were as white as snow .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">The soldiers guarding <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the tomb</COREF></COREF> were very afraid of <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the angel</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> shook with fear and then became like dead men .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">The angel</COREF> said to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the women</COREF> , `` *PRO* Do n't be afraid .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are looking for <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jesus</COREF> , <COREF ID="40" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the one who *T*-1 was killed *-2 on the cross</COREF></COREF> .
But <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is not here .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has risen from death , as <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would *?* .
*PRO* Come and see the place where <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> body was *T*-1 .
And *PRO* go quickly and tell <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> followers</COREF> , ' <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> has risen from death .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is going into <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Galilee</COREF> and will be there before <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> will see <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> there . ' ''
Then <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the angel</COREF> said , `` Now <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have told <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> . ''
So <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the women</COREF> left <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the tomb</COREF> quickly .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were afraid , but <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were also very happy .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> ran *PRO*-1 to tell <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> followers</COREF> what *T*-2 happened .
Suddenly , <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> was there in front of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said , `` Hello ! ''
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">The women</COREF> went to <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and , *PRO*-1 holding on to <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> feet , worshiped <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> said to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , `` *PRO* Do n't be afraid .
*PRO* Go tell <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> followers</COREF> *PRO*-1 to go to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Galilee</COREF> .
<COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will see <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> there . ''
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">The women</COREF> went *PRO*-1 to tell <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the followers</COREF> .
At the same time , <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">some of <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the soldiers who *T*-1 were guarding <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the tomb</COREF></COREF></COREF> went into the city .
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> went *PRO*-1 to tell <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the leading priests</COREF> everything that *T*-2 happened .
Then <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the priests</COREF> met with the older Jewish leaders and made a plan .
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> paid <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the soldiers</COREF> <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">a lot of money</COREF> and said to <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , `` *PRO* Tell the people that <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus '</COREF> followers</COREF> came during the night and stole the body while <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were sleeping .
If <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the governor</COREF> hears about this , <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will talk to <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and keep <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *PRO*-1 out of trouble . ''
So <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the soldiers</COREF> kept <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the money</COREF> and obeyed <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the priests</COREF> .
And that story is still spread *T*-1 among the Jews even today .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">The eleven followers</COREF> went to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">Galilee</COREF> , to <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">the mountain where <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> told <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-2 to go *T*-1</COREF> .
On <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">the mountain</COREF> <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the followers</COREF> saw <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> worshiped <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
But some of <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the followers</COREF> did not believe that it was really <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> came to <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and said , `` All authority in heaven and on earth is given *-1 to <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
So *PRO* go and make followers of <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">all people in the world</COREF> .
*PRO* Baptize <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in the name of <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the Father</COREF> and <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the Son</COREF> and the Holy Spirit .
*PRO* Teach <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to obey everything that <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have told <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *PRO*-3 to do *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> can be sure that <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will be with <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> always .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will continue with <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> until the end of time . ''
