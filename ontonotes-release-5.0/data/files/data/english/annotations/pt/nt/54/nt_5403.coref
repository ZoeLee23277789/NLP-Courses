It *EXP*-1 is a true statement that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">anyone whose goal *T*-2 is *PRO* to serve as an elder</COREF> has <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> heart set *-3 on a good work .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">An elder</COREF> must be such a good man that no one can rightly criticize <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must be faithful to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must have self - control and be wise .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must be respected *-1 by others .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must be ready *PRO*-1 to help <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> by *PRO* welcoming <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> into <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> home .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must be a good teacher .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must not drink too much , and <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> must not be someone who *T*-1 likes *PRO*-2 to fight .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must be gentle and peaceful .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must not be someone who *T*-1 loves money .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> a good leader of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own family .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> means that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> children obey <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> with full respect .
If <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">a man</COREF> does not know how *PRO* to lead <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own family *T*-1 , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will not be able *PRO*-2 to take care of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> church</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">An elder</COREF> must not <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> a new believer .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> might make <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> too proud of <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be condemned *-1 for <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> pride the same as <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the devil</COREF> was *?* .
<COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">An elder</COREF> must also have the respect of people who *T*-1 are not part of <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the church</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will not be criticized *-1 by others and be caught *-1 in <COREF ID="58" TYPE="IDENT">the devil 's</COREF> trap .
In the same way , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the men who *T*-1 are chosen *-2 *PRO*-3 to be special servants</COREF> must have the respect of others .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> must not be <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">men who *T*-1 say things 0 <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't mean *T*-2 or who *T*-3 spend <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> time *PRO*-4 drinking too much</COREF> .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> must not be men who *T*-1 will do almost anything for money .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> must follow the true faith that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> has now made *-1 known to <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> and always do what <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> know 0 *T*-2 is right .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> should test <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> first .
Then , if <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> find that <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have done nothing wrong , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can be special servants .
In the same way , <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">the women</COREF> must have the respect of others .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> must not be women who *T*-1 speak evil about other people .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> must have self - control and be women who *T*-1 can be trusted *-2 in everything .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">The men who *T*-1 are special servants</COREF> must be faithful in marriage .
<COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> must be good leaders of children and <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own families .
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Those who *T*-1 do well as special servants</COREF> are making an honorable place for <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will feel very sure of <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> faith in <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Christ Jesus</COREF> .
<COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hope 0 <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can come to <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> soon .
But <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am writing this to <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> now , so that , even if <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can not come soon , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will know how people should live in <COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">the family of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF></COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="135" TYPE="IDENT">That family</COREF> is <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the church of <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">the living God</COREF></COREF> .
And <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> church</COREF> is the support and foundation of the truth .
Without a doubt , the secret of <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> life of worship is great : <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> was shown *-1 to <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> in human form ; the Spirit proved that <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was right ; <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was seen *-2 by angels .
The message about <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> was told *-1 to the nations ; people in the world believed in <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> ; <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was taken *-2 up to heaven in glory .
