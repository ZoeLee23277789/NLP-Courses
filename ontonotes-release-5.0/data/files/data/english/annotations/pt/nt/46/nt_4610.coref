<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Brothers and sisters</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to know what *T*-1 happened to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> ancestors who *T*-2 were with <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Moses</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were all under <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the cloud</COREF> , and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> walked through <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the sea</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were all baptized *-1 into <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">Moses</COREF> in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the cloud</COREF> and in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">the sea</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">They <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> ate the same spiritual food , and <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> drank the same spiritual drink .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> drank from <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">that spiritual rock that *T*-1 was with <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">that rock</COREF> was <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> was not pleased with <COREF ID="nt_4610.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">most of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">those people</COREF></COREF> , so <COREF ID="nt_4610.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were killed *-1 in the desert .
And <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">these things that *T*-1 happened</COREF> are <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">examples</COREF> for <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">These examples</COREF> should stop <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> from *PRO* wanting evil things like <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">those people</COREF> did *?* .
*PRO* Do n't worship idols as <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">some of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> did .
As the Scriptures say , `` <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">The people</COREF> sat down *PRO*-1 to eat and drink and then got up *PRO*-1 to have a wild party . ''
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> should not commit sexual sins as some of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> did .
In one day <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">23 , 000 of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> died because of <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sin .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> should not test <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> as <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">some of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">did</COREF> *?* .
Because of <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were killed *-1 by snakes .
And *PRO* do n't complain as <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">some of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> did *?* .
Because <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> complained , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were killed *-1 by the angel that *T*-2 destroys .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">The things that *T*-1 happened to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">those people</COREF></COREF> are examples .
<COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were written *-1 *PRO*-2 to be warnings for <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> live in the time that all those past histories were pointing to *T*-1 .
So <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">anyone who *T*-1 thinks 0 <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are standing *PRO*-2 strong</COREF> should be careful that <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't fall .
The only temptations that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have *T*-1 are the same temptations that all people have *T*-2 .
But <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> can trust <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> will not let <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> be tempted *-1 more than <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> can bear .
But when <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are tempted *-2 *T*-1 , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> will also give <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> a way 0 *PRO* to escape <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">that temptation</COREF> *T*-3 .
Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will be able *PRO*-1 to endure <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
So , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> dear friends</COREF> , *PRO* stay away from *PRO* worshiping idols .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are intelligent people .
*PRO* Judge for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">yourselves</COREF> the truth of what <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> say *T*-1 now .

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The cup of blessing that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> give thanks for *T*-1</COREF> is a sharing in the blood sacrifice of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> , is n't <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *?* ?
And <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the bread that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> break *T*-1</COREF> is a sharing in the body of <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> , is n't <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *?* ?
There is <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">one loaf of bread</COREF> , so <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we who *T*-1 are many</COREF> are one body , because <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> share in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">that one loaf</COREF> .
And *PRO* think about what <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the people of Israel</COREF> do *T*-1 .
When <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> eat <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the sacrifices</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are united *-2 by *PRO* sharing what *T*-3 was offered *-4 on the altar .
So , am <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saying that sacrifices to idols are the same as <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">those Jewish sacrifices</COREF> ?
No , because an idol is nothing , and the things offered * to idols are worth nothing .
But <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am saying that when <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">food</COREF> is sacrificed *-2 to idols *T*-1 , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is an offering to demons , not to <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't want <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to share anything with demons .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> can not drink the cup of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> and then go *PRO*-1 drink a cup that *T*-2 honors demons .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> can not share a meal at <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord 's</COREF> table and then go *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">share</COREF> a meal that *T*-2 honors demons .
*PRO* Doing <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">make</COREF> <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> jealous .
Do <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> really want *PRO*-1 to do <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> ?
Do <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are stronger 0 than <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is *T*-1 ?
`` All things are allowed *-2 , '' <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> say *T*-1 .
But not all things are good .
`` All things are allowed *-1 . ''
But some things do n't help anyone .
*PRO* Try *PRO*-1 to do what *T*-2 is good for others , not just what *T*-3 is good for <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">yourselves</COREF> .
*PRO* Eat <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">any meat that *T*-1 is sold *-2 in the meat market</COREF> .
*PRO* Do n't ask questions about <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-1 to see if <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is something 0 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 *T*-2 is wrong 0 *PRO* to eat *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> can eat <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , `` because <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> and everything in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> belong to <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">Someone who *T*-1 is not a believer</COREF> might invite <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *PRO*-2 to eat with <COREF ID="91" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to go , then *PRO* eat <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">anything that *T*-2 is put *-3 before <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* Do n't ask questions *PRO*-1 to see if <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is something 0 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 *T*-2 is wrong 0 *PRO* to eat *T*-3 .
But if <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">someone</COREF> tells <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">That food</COREF> <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> offered *-1 to idols , '' then *PRO* do n't <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">eat</COREF> <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
That 's because some people think 0 <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is wrong , and <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> might cause a problem for <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the person who *T*-1 told <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't mean that <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is wrong .
But <COREF ID="102" TYPE="IDENT">the other person</COREF> might <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">think</COREF> 0 <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is wrong .
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's the only reason 0 *PRO* not to eat <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> own freedom should not be judged *-1 by what another person thinks *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> eat <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">the meal</COREF> with thankfulness .
So <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to be criticized *-2 because of something 0 <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> thank <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> for *T*-3 .
So if <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> eat , or if <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> drink , or if <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">anything</COREF> , *PRO* do <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> for the glory of <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
Never *PRO* do anything that *T*-1 might make other people *ICH*-2 do wrong -- Jews , non-Jews , or anyone in <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> church .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do the same thing .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> try *PRO*-1 to please everyone in every way .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am not trying *PRO*-1 to do what *T*-2 is good for <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am trying *PRO*-1 to do what *T*-2 is good for <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">the most people</COREF> so that <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can be saved *-3 .
