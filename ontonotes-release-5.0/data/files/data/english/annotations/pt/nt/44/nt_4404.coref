There were <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">some priests , the captain of the soldiers that *T*-1 guarded the Temple , and some Sadducees</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were upset because of what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> and <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF></COREF> were teaching <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> *T*-1 .
By *PRO* telling people about <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> , <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the apostles</COREF> were teaching that people will rise from death .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The Jewish leaders</COREF> arrested <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> and <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF></COREF> and put <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">jail</COREF> .
It was already night , so <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> kept <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 in <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">jail</COREF> until <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the next day</COREF> .
But many of the people who *T*-1 heard <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the apostles</COREF> believed what <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> said *T*-2 .
There were now about 5000 men in the group of believers .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">The next day</COREF> <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">the Jewish rulers</COREF> , <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">the older Jewish leaders</COREF> , and the teachers of the law</COREF> met in <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Jerusalem</COREF> .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Annas</COREF> <COREF ID="47" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the high priest</COREF></COREF> , Caiaphas , John , and Alexander were there .
Everyone from <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">the high priest 's</COREF> family was there .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> made <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> and <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF></COREF> stand before all the people .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> asked <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> over and over , `` How did <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">make</COREF> <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">this crippled man</COREF> well *T*-1 ?

By whose authority did <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> *T*-1 ? ''
Then <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> was filled *-1 with the Holy Spirit and said to <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">Rulers of the people</COREF> and <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> older leaders</COREF></COREF> , are <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> questioning <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> about what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did *T*-3 *PRO*-2 to help <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">this crippled man</COREF> ?
Are <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> asking <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> what *T*-1 made <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> well ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> want <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">all of <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF></COREF> and all the people of Israel to know that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">this man</COREF> was made *-1 well by <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the power of <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus Christ from Nazareth</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> nailed <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> to a cross , but <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> raised <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> from death .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">This man</COREF> was crippled , but <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is now well .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is able *PRO*-1 to stand here before <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> because of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the power of <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF></COREF> !
<COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> is ' <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the stone that you builders thought 0 *T*-1 was not important</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">this stone</COREF> has become the cornerstone . '
<COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> is the only one who *T*-1 can save people .
<COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> name</COREF> is the only power in the world that *T*-1 has been given *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to save anyone .
We must be saved *-1 through <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> ! ''
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">The Jewish leaders</COREF> understood that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> and <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF></COREF> had no special training or education .
But <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> also saw that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were not afraid *PRO*-1 to speak .
So <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the leaders</COREF> were amazed .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> also realized that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> and <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF></COREF> had been with <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> saw <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the crippled man</COREF> standing there beside <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the apostles</COREF> .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> saw that <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was healed *-1 , so <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could say nothing against <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the apostles</COREF> .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">The Jewish leaders</COREF> told <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to leave the council meeting .
Then <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the leaders</COREF> talked to each other about what <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should do *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> said , `` What shall <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do *T*-1 with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">these men</COREF> ?
Everyone in <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">Jerusalem</COREF> knows about <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the miracle 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did *T*-1 as a sign from <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's too obvious .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> ca n't say 0 <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did n't happen .
But <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> must make <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> afraid *PRO*-1 to talk to anyone again about <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that man</COREF> .
Then this problem will not spread among the people . ''
So <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the Jewish leaders</COREF> called <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> and <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF></COREF> in again .
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> told <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the apostles</COREF> *PRO*-1 not to say anything or to teach anything in <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">the name of <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF></COREF> .
But <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Peter</COREF> and <COREF ID="nt_4404.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">John</COREF></COREF> answered <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , `` What do <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 *T*-1 is right ?
What would <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> want *T*-1 ?
Should <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> obey <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> or <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> can not be quiet .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> must tell people about what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have seen and heard *T*-1 . ''
<COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">The Jewish leaders</COREF> could not find a way 0 *PRO* to punish <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the apostles</COREF> *T*-1 , because all the people were praising <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> for what *T*-2 had been done *-3 .
<COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">This miracle</COREF> was a sign from <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">The man who *T*-1 was healed *-2</COREF> was more than 40 years old .
So <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the Jewish leaders</COREF> warned <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the apostles</COREF> again and let <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> go *PRO*-1 free .

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Peter and John</COREF> left the meeting of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Jewish leaders</COREF> and went to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own group</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> told <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the group</COREF> <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">everything that <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the leading priests and the older Jewish leaders</COREF> had said *T*-1 to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> .

<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> said , `` <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">Master</COREF> , <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are the one who *T*-1 made the sky , <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> , the sea , and everything in the world .

That 's what *T*-1 actually happened when <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">Herod , Pontius Pilate , the other nations , and the people of Israel <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> came together against <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> here in Jerusalem *T*-2 .
