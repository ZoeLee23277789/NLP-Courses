Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">a scroll in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the right hand of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the one sitting on <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF></COREF></COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">The scroll</COREF> had writing on both sides and was kept *-1 *PRO*-2 closed *-3 with <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">seven seals</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw a powerful angel , who *T*-1 called in a loud voice , `` Who *T*-2 is worthy *PRO*-3 to break <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the seals</COREF> and open <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the scroll</COREF> ? ''
But there was no one in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">heaven</COREF> or on <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">earth</COREF> or under <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> who *T*-1 could open <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the scroll</COREF> or look inside <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> cried and cried because there was no one who *T*-1 was worthy *PRO*-2 to open <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the scroll</COREF> or look inside .
But one of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the elders</COREF> said to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , `` *PRO* Do n't cry !
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">The Lion from the tribe of Judah</COREF> has won the victory .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is David 's descendant .

Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">a Lamb</COREF> standing in the center near <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF> with <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the four living beings</COREF> around <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The elders</COREF> were also around <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the Lamb</COREF> .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">The Lamb</COREF> looked as if <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had been killed *-1 .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> had seven horns and seven eyes , which *T*-1 are the seven spirits of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> that *T*-2 were sent *-3 into all the world .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">The Lamb</COREF> came and took <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the scroll</COREF> from <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the right hand of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the one sitting on <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF></COREF></COREF> .

Each one of <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> had a harp .
Also , <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were holding golden bowls full of incense , which *T*-1 are the prayers of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> holy people .
And <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">they <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> sang a new song *ICH*-1 to <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the Lamb</COREF> : `` <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are worthy *PRO*-2 to take <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the scroll</COREF> and to open <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> seals</COREF> , because <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were killed *-3 , and with <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> blood sacrifice <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> bought <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> from every tribe , language , race of people , and nation .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> made <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to be a kingdom and to be priests for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">our God</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will rule on <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> . ''
Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> looked , and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> heard the voices of <COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">many angels</COREF> .
<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">The angels</COREF> were around <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF> , <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">the four living beings</COREF> , and <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the elders</COREF> .

<COREF ID="106" TYPE="IDENT">The angels</COREF> said in a loud voice , `` All power , wealth , wisdom , and strength belong to <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the Lamb who *T*-1 was killed *-2</COREF> .
<COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is worthy *PRO*-1 to receive honor , glory , and praise ! ''
Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> heard every created being that *T*-1 is in <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">heaven</COREF> and on <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">earth</COREF> and under <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> and in the sea , everything in all these places , saying , `` All praise and honor and glory and power forever and ever to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the one who *T*-2 sits on <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the throne</COREF></COREF> and to <COREF ID="42" TYPE="IDENT">the Lamb</COREF> !
