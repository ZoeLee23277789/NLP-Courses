So what can <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> say *T*-1 about <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Abraham</COREF> , <COREF ID="3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the father of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> people</COREF></COREF></COREF> ?
What did <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> learn *T*-1 about faith ?
If <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> was made *-1 right by the things 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did *T*-2 , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had a reason 0 *PRO* to boast about <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *T*-3 .
But <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> knew different .
That 's why <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the Scriptures</COREF> say , `` <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">believed</COREF> <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> , and because of <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was accepted *-2 as one who *T*-3 is right with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> *T*-1 . ''
When <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> work *T*-1 , <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> pay</COREF> is not given *-2 to <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> as a gift .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> earn <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the pay 0 <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> get *T*-1</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> can not do any work that *T*-1 will make <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> right with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must trust in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> accepts <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> faith , and that makes <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> right with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is the one who *T*-1 makes even evil people right .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">David</COREF> said the same thing when <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was talking about the blessing 0 <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> have *T*-2 when <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> accepts <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> as good without *PRO* looking at what <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have done *T*-4 *T*-3 *T*-1 : `` It is a great blessing when <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> are forgiven *-6 for the wrongs 0 <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have done *T*-7 *T*-5 , when <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sins are erased *-9 *T*-8 !
It is <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">a great blessing</COREF> when <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> accepts <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> as if <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are without sin *T*-1 ! ''
Is <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">this blessing</COREF> only for <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-1 are circumcised *-2</COREF> ?
Or is <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> also for those who *T*-1 are not circumcised *-2 ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have already said that it was because of <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham 's</COREF> faith</COREF> 0 that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was accepted *-2 as one who *T*-3 is right with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> *T*-1 .
So how did this happen *T*-1 ?
Did <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> accept <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> before or after <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was circumcised *-1 ?
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> accepted <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> before <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> circumcision</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> was circumcised *-1 later *PRO* to show that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> accepted <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> circumcision</COREF> was proof that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was right with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> through faith before <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was circumcised *-1 .
So <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> is the father of <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">all those who *T*-1 believe but are not circumcised *-2</COREF> .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> believe and are accepted *-1 as people who *T*-2 are right with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> is also the father of <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-1 have been circumcised *-2</COREF> .
But it is not <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> circumcision that *T*-1 makes <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> father .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> father only if <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> live *PRO*-1 following <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT">the faith that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> father</COREF> <COREF ID="118" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Abraham</COREF></COREF> had *T*-2 before <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was circumcised *-3</COREF> .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> descendants</COREF> received <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the promise that <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would get the whole world</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> did not receive <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">that promise</COREF> because <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> followed <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> received <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">that promise</COREF> because <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was right with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> through <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> faith</COREF> .
If people could get <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> promise</COREF> by *PRO* following <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> , then faith is worthless .
And <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> promise to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF></COREF> is worthless , because <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the law</COREF> can only bring <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> anger on those who *T*-1 disobey <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
But if there is no law , then there is nothing 0 *PRO* to disobey *T*-1 .
So people get what <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> promised *T*-1 by *PRO* having faith .
This happens so that <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the promise</COREF> can be a free gift .
And if <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">the promise</COREF> is a free gift , then all of <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham 's</COREF> people</COREF> will get <COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">that promise</COREF> .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">The promise</COREF> is not just for those who *T*-1 live under <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">the Law of Moses</COREF> .
<COREF ID="125" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is for all who *T*-1 live with faith as <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> did *?* .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is the father of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> .
As <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the Scriptures</COREF> say , `` I have made <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> a father of many nations . ''
This is true before <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">God</COREF> , <COREF ID="188" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the one 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> believed *T*-1 -- the God who *T*-2 gives life to the dead and speaks of <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">things that *T*-3 do n't yet exist</COREF> as if <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are real</COREF></COREF> .
There was no hope that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> would have children , but <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">believed</COREF> <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> and continued *-1 to hope .
And <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is why <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> became the father of many nations *T*-1 .
As <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> told <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> will have many descendants . ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> was almost a hundred years old , so <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was past the age for *PRO* having children .
Also , Sarah could not have children .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> was well aware of this , but <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> faith in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF></COREF> never became weak .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> never doubted that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> would do what <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> promised *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> never stopped *-1 believing .
In fact , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> grew stronger in <COREF ID="74" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> faith</COREF> and just praised <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> felt sure that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> was able *PRO*-1 to do what <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> promised *T*-2 .
So that 's why `` <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was accepted *-2 as one who *T*-3 is right with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> *T*-1 . ''
<COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">These words -LRB- `` <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was accepted *-2</COREF> '' -RRB- were written *-1 not only for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Abraham</COREF> .
<COREF ID="239" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were also written *-1 for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> will also accept <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> because <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> believe .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> believe in <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the one who *T*-1 raised <COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="250" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jesus</COREF> <COREF ID="250" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> Lord</COREF></COREF> from death</COREF> .
<COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> was handed *-1 over *PRO*-2 to die for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> sins , and <COREF ID="249" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was raised *-3 from death *PRO*-4 to make <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> right with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
