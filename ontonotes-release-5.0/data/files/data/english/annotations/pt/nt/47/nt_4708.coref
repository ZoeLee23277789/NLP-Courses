And now , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">brothers and sisters</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to know about the grace that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> gave <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the churches in Macedonia</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Those believers</COREF> have been tested *-1 by great troubles , and <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are very poor .
But <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> gave much because of <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> great joy .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> can tell <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> that <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">gave</COREF> as much as <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were able and even more 0 than <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could afford *T*-1 .
No one told <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 to do <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> .
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> idea .
But <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> asked <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> again and again -- <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> begged <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> *PRO*-1 to let <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> share in this service for <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> people .
And <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> gave in a way that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did not expect *T*-1 :
<COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">gave</COREF> <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> and to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> before <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> gave <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> money .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is what <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> wants *T*-1 .
So <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> asked <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Titus</COREF> *PRO*-1 to help <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> finish <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">this special work of giving</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is the one who *T*-1 started <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">this work</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are rich in everything -- in faith , in speaking ability , in knowledge , in the willingness *PRO* to help , and in the love 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> learned *T*-1 from <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
And so <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to also be rich in <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">this work of giving</COREF> .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am not ordering <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *PRO*-1 to give , but <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-2 to see how real <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> love is *T*-3 by *PRO* comparing <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> with others who *T*-4 have been so ready and willing *PRO* to help .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> know the grace of <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> Lord Jesus Christ</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> know that <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gave up <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> heavenly riches for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> gave up everything so that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> could be richly blessed *-1 .
This is what <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> should do *T*-1 : Last year <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were the first 0 *T*-2 to want *PRO*-3 to give , and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were the first who *T*-4 gave .
So now *PRO* finish the work 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> started *T*-1 .
Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> `` doing '' will be equal to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> `` wanting *PRO*-1 to do . ''
*PRO* Give from what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have *T*-1 .
If <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to give , <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> gift</COREF> will be accepted *-2 .
<COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Your</COREF> gift</COREF> will be judged *-1 by what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have *T*-2 , not by what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do n't have *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do n't want <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to have troubles while <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">others</COREF> are comforted *-1 .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> want everything to be equal .
At this time <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have plenty and can provide what <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> need *T*-1 .
Then later , when <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have plenty *T*-1 , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can provide what <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> need *T*-2 .
Then everyone will have an equal share .
As the Scriptures say , `` Those who *T*-1 gathered much did not have too much , and those who *T*-2 gathered little did not have too little . ''
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> thank <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> because <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gave <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Titus</COREF> the same love for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Titus</COREF> agreed *PRO*-1 to do what <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> asked *T*-2 .
In fact , <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">he <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> wanted very much *PRO*-1 to come see <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are sending with <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Titus</COREF> <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">the brother who *T*-1 is praised *-2 by <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">all the churches</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is praised *-1 because of <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> service to the Good News .
Also , <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was chosen *-1 by <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the churches</COREF> *PRO*-2 to go with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> when <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> carry <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">this gift</COREF> *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are doing this service *PRO*-1 to bring honor to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> and to show that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> really want *PRO*-2 to help .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are being careful so that no one will criticize <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> about the way 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are caring for <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">this large gift</COREF> *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are trying *PRO*-1 to do what *T*-2 is right .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to do what <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> accepts *T*-2 as right and also what people think 0 *T*-3 is right .
Also , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are sending with them <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> brother who *T*-1 is always ready *PRO* to help</COREF> .
<COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> has proved this to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> in many ways .
And <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to help even more now because <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has much faith in <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
Now about <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">Titus</COREF> -- <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> partner .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is working together with <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> *PRO*-1 to help <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
And about <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">the other brothers</COREF> -- <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are sent *-1 from <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">the churches</COREF> , and <COREF ID="195" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> bring honor to <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> .
So *PRO* show <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">these men</COREF> that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> really have love .
*PRO* Show <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> why <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are proud of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *T*-1 .
Then <COREF ID="151" TYPE="IDENT">all the churches</COREF> can see it .
