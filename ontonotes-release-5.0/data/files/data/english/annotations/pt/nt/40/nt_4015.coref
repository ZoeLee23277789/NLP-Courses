Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">some Pharisees and teachers of the law</COREF> came to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> came from Jerusalem and asked <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , `` Why do <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> followers</COREF> not obey the traditions 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have *T*-2 from <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> great leaders who *T*-3 lived long ago *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Your</COREF> followers</COREF> do n't wash <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hands before <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> eat ! ''
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> answered , `` And why do <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> refuse *PRO*-2 to obey <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> command so that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> can follow those traditions 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have *T*-3 *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> said , ' <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> must respect <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> father and mother . '
And <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> also said , ' Whoever *T*-2 says anything bad to their father or mother must be killed *-1 . '
But <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> teach that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">a person</COREF> can say to <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> father or mother</COREF> , ' <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">something 0 <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> could use *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to help <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF></COREF> .
But <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will not use <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> for <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will give <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> . '
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are teaching <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-1 not to respect <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> father .
So <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are teaching that it *EXP*-1 is not important *PRO* to do what <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> said *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-1 is more important *PRO* to follow those traditions 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are hypocrites !
<COREF ID="nt_4015.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Isaiah</COREF> was right when <COREF ID="nt_4015.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> spoke for <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> about <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> *T*-1 : ' <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">These people</COREF> honor <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> with <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> words , but <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am not really important to <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> worship of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> is worthless .
The things 0 <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> teach *T*-1 are only human rules . ' ''
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> called the people to <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said , `` *PRO* Listen and understand what <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am saying *T*-1 .
It is not what <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> put *T*-1 in <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mouth that *T*-2 makes <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> wrong .
It is what *T*-1 comes out of <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mouth that *T*-2 makes <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> wrong . ''

Then <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the followers</COREF> came to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> and asked , `` Do <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Pharisees</COREF> are upset about what <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> said *T*-1 ? ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> answered , `` Every plant that <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> Father in heaven</COREF> has not planted *T*-2 will be pulled *-1 up by the roots .
*PRO* Stay away from <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the Pharisees</COREF> .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> lead the people , but <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are like blind men leading other blind men .
And if a blind man leads another blind man , both of them will fall into a ditch . ''
Peter said , `` *PRO* Explain to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> what <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> said *T*-2 earlier to the people . ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> said , `` Do <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> still have trouble *PRO* understanding ?
Surely <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know that <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">all the food that *T*-1 enters the mouth</COREF> goes into the stomach .
Then <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> goes out of the body .
But the bad things 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> say *T*-1 with <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mouth come from <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the way 0 <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think *T*-2</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's what *T*-1 can make people wrong .
All these bad things *ICH*-1 begin in the mind : <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">evil thoughts , murder , adultery , sexual sins , *PRO* stealing , lying , and insulting people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">These</COREF> are the things that *T*-1 make people wrong .
*PRO* Eating without *PRO* washing <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hands will never make <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> unacceptable to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> went from there to <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the area of Tyre and Sidon</COREF> .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">A Canaanite woman from <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">that area</COREF></COREF> came out and began *-1 shouting , `` <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Lord</COREF> , <COREF ID="66" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Son of David</COREF></COREF> , please *PRO* help <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> !
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> daughter</COREF> has a demon inside <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> , and <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is suffering very much . ''
But <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> did not answer <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the followers</COREF> came to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and said , `` *PRO* Tell <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> *PRO*-1 to go away .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> keeps *-1 crying out and will not leave <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> *PRO*-2 alone . ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> answered , `` <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> sent <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> only to the lost people of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> . ''
Then <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the woman</COREF> came over to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> and bowed before <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said , `` <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Lord</COREF> , *PRO* help <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> ! ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> answered <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> with this saying : `` It *EXP*-1 is not right *PRO* to take <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">the children 's bread</COREF> and give <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">the dogs</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">The woman</COREF> said , `` Yes , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Lord</COREF> , but <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">even the dogs</COREF> eat the pieces of food that *T*-1 fall from <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> master 's table . ''
Then <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> answered , `` <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">Woman</COREF> , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have great faith !
<COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> will get what <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> asked for *T*-1 . ''
And right then <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">the woman 's</COREF> daughter</COREF> was healed *-1 .
Then <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> went from there to the shore of Lake Galilee .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> went up on a hill and sat down .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">A large crowd of people</COREF> came to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> brought <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">many other sick people</COREF> and put <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> before <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
There were <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">people who *T*-1 could not walk , people who *T*-2 were blind , crippled , or deaf , and many others</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> healed <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">them <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> were amazed when <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> saw that those who *T*-3 could not speak were now able *PRO*-2 to speak *T*-1 .
Crippled people were made *-1 strong .
Those who *T*-2 could not walk were now able *PRO*-1 to walk .
The blind were able *PRO*-1 to see .
Everyone thanked <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the God of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF></COREF> for this .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> called <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> followers</COREF> to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and said , `` <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> feel sorry for <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">these people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> have been with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> three days , and now <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have nothing 0 *PRO* to eat *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-1 to send <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> away *PRO*-2 hungry .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> might faint while *PRO* going home . ''
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The followers</COREF> asked <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> , `` Where can <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> get enough bread *PRO*-2 to feed <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">all these people</COREF> *T*-1 ?
We are a long way from any town . ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> asked , `` How many loaves of bread do <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have *T*-1 ? ''
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> answered , `` <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">seven loaves of bread</COREF> and <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">a few small fish</COREF></COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> told <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> *PRO*-1 to sit on the ground .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> took <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the seven loaves of bread</COREF> and <COREF ID="178" TYPE="IDENT">the fish</COREF></COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gave thanks to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> for <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the food</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> broke <COREF ID="184" TYPE="IDENT">the bread</COREF> into pieces , which <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gave *T*-1 to <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the followers</COREF> , and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> gave <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">the food</COREF> to <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">the people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">All the people</COREF> <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">ate</COREF> until <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were full .
After <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the followers</COREF> filled seven baskets with the pieces of food that *T*-1 were not eaten *-2 .
