Now , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">brothers and sisters</COREF> , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to understand about spiritual gifts .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> remember the lives 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> lived *T*-1 before <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were believers .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> let <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">yourselves</COREF> be influenced *-1 and led *-1 away *PRO*-2 to worship <COREF ID="13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">idols</COREF> -- <COREF ID="13" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">things that *T*-3 have no life</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> tell <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> that no one who *T*-1 is speaking with the help of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> Spirit</COREF> says , `` <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> be cursed *-2 . ''
And no one can say , `` <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> is <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">Lord</COREF> , '' without the help of <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the Holy Spirit</COREF> .
There are different kinds of <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">spiritual gifts</COREF> , but <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are all from <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the same Spirit</COREF> .
There are different ways 0 *PRO* to serve *T*-1 , but <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> serve <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the same Lord</COREF> .
And there are different ways that <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> works in people *T*-1 , but it is <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the same God</COREF> who *T*-2 works in <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">all of <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF></COREF> *PRO*-3 to do everything .
<COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">Something from <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the Spirit</COREF></COREF> can be seen *-1 in each person .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The Spirit</COREF> gives <COREF ID="46" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> to each one *PRO*-1 to help others .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The Spirit</COREF> gives one person the ability *PRO* to speak with wisdom .
And <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the same Spirit</COREF> gives another person the ability *PRO* to speak with knowledge .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The same Spirit</COREF> gives faith to one person and to another <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gives gifts of healing .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The Spirit</COREF> gives to one person the power *PRO* to do miracles , to another the ability *PRO* to prophesy , and to another the ability *PRO* to judge what *T*-1 is from <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">the Spirit</COREF> and what *T*-2 is not .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The Spirit</COREF> gives one person the ability *PRO* to speak in <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">different kinds of languages</COREF> , and to another the ability *PRO* to interpret <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">those languages</COREF> .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">One Spirit</COREF> , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the same Spirit</COREF></COREF> , does all these things .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">The Spirit</COREF> decides what *PRO* to give each one *T*-1 .
A person has <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">only one body</COREF> , but <COREF ID="92" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has many parts .
Yes , there are <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">many parts</COREF> , but <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">all those parts</COREF> are still just one body .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> is like that too .

<TEXT PARTNO="001">
Some of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> are Jews and some of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> are not *?* ; some of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> are slaves and some of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> are free .
But <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were all baptized *-1 *PRO*-2 to become one body through <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">one Spirit</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were all given *-1 <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">the one Spirit</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">a person 's body</COREF> has more than one part .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> has many parts .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">The foot</COREF> might say , `` <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am not a hand , so <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't belong to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> . ''
But *PRO* saying this would not stop <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">the foot</COREF> from *PRO* being a part of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">The ear</COREF> might say , `` <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am not an eye , so <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't belong to <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> . ''
But *PRO* saying this would not make <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the ear</COREF> stop *-1 being a part of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the whole body</COREF> were an eye , <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would not be able *PRO*-1 to hear .
If <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the whole body</COREF> were an ear , <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would not be able *PRO*-1 to smell anything .
If each part of <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> were the same part , there would be no body .
But as it is , <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> put <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the parts</COREF> in <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> as <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wanted <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> made a place for each one .
So there are many parts , but <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">only one body</COREF> .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">The eye</COREF> can not say to <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the hand</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't need <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ! ''
And <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">the head</COREF> can not say to <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the foot</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="68" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't need <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ! ''
No , those parts of <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> that *T*-1 seem *-2 to be weaker are really very important .
And the parts that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> think *T*-1 are not worth very much are the parts 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> give the most care to *T*-2 .
And <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> give <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">special care</COREF> to the parts of <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do n't want *PRO*-2 to show *T*-1 .
The more beautiful parts do n't need <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">this special care</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> put <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> together and gave <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">more honor</COREF> to the parts that *T*-1 need <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> did this so that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> body would not be divided *-1 .
<COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> wanted the different parts to care the same for each other .
If <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">one part of <COREF ID="nt_4612.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF></COREF> suffers , then all the other parts suffer with <COREF ID="100" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Or if <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">one part</COREF> is honored *-1 , then all the other parts share <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> honor .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">All of you together</COREF> are <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">the body of Christ</COREF> .
Each one of <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> is a part of <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">that body</COREF> .
And in the church <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> has given a place first to apostles , second to prophets , and third to teachers .
Then <COREF ID="52" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> has given a place to those who *T*-1 do miracles , those who *T*-2 have gifts of healing , those who *T*-3 can help others , those who *T*-4 are able *PRO* to lead , and those who *T*-5 can speak in different kinds of languages .
Not all are apostles .
Not all are prophets .
Not all are teachers .
Not all do miracles .
Not all have gifts of healing .
Not all speak in <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">different kinds of languages</COREF> .
Not all interpret <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">those languages</COREF> .
*PRO* Continue *-1 to give <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> attention to the spiritual gifts 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> consider *T*-2 to be the greatest .
But now I want *PRO*-1 to point out a way of life that *T*-2 is even greater .
