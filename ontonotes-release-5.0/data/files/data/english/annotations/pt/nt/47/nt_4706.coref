<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are workers together with <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> beg <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> : *PRO* Do n't let the grace that <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> received *T*-1 from <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> be for nothing .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> says , `` <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> heard <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> at the right time , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> gave <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> help on <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">the day of salvation</COREF> . ''
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> tell <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> that the `` right time '' is now .
<COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">The `` day of salvation</COREF> '' is now .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> do n't want people to find anything wrong with <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> work .
So <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do nothing that *T*-1 will be a problem to others .
But in every way <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> show that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are servants of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> never give up , even though <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> face troubles , difficulties , and problems of every kind .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are beaten *-1 and thrown *-1 into prison .
People get upset at <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> and fight against <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> work hard , and sometimes <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> get no sleep or food .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> show that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> servants by <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> pure lives , by <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> understanding , by <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> patience , and by <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> kindness .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> show <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> by the Holy Spirit , by genuine love , by *PRO* speaking the truth , and by *PRO* depending on <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> power .
This right way of living has prepared <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> *PRO*-1 to defend <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">ourselves</COREF> against every kind of attack .
Some people honor <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> , but others shame <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
Some people say good things about <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> , but others say bad things .
Some people say 0 <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are liars , but <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> speak the truth .
To some people <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are not known *-1 , but <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are well known .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> seem *-1 to be dying , but *PRO* look !
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> continue *-1 to live .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are punished *-1 , but <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are not killed *-2 .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have much sadness , but <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are always rejoicing .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> are poor , but <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are making many people rich in faith .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have nothing , but really <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have everything .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have spoken freely to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you people in Corinth</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have opened <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> hearts to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> feelings of love for <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have not stopped .
It is <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> who *T*-1 have stopped <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> feelings of love for <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> .
<COREF ID="nt_4706.part-000.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> speak to <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> as if <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were <COREF ID="nt_4706.part-000.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> children .
*PRO* Do the same 0 as <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have done *T*-1 -- *PRO* open <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> hearts also .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are not the same as <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-1 do n't believe</COREF> .
So *PRO* do n't join <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">yourselves</COREF> to <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Good and evil do n't belong together .
Light and darkness can not share the same room .
How can there be any unity between Christ and the devil *T*-1 ?
What does a believer have *T*-1 in common with an unbeliever ?
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> temple can not have anything 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with idols , and <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> are the temple of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the living God</COREF> .
As <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> said , `` <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will live with <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and walk with <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> ; <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will be <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> God , and <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will be <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> people . ''
`` So *PRO* come away from <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">those people</COREF> and separate <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">yourselves</COREF> from <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , says *T*-1 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> .
*PRO* Do n't touch anything that *T*-1 is not clean , and <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will accept <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> . ''
`` <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will be <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> father , and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will be <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> sons and daughters , says *T*-1 <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord All - Powerful</COREF> . ''
