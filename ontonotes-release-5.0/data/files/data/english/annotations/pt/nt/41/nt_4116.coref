<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">The stone</COREF> was very large , but <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was moved *-1 away from <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the entrance</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The women</COREF> walked into <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the tomb</COREF> and saw <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">a young man *ICH*-1</COREF> there wearing a white robe .
<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was sitting on the right side of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the tomb</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The women</COREF> were afraid .
But <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF> said , `` *PRO* Do n't be afraid .

<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The women</COREF> were very afraid and confused .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> left <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the tomb</COREF> and ran away .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> did not tell about what *T*-1 happened , because <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were afraid .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> rose from death early on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the first day of the week</COREF> .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> appeared first to <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mary Magdalene</COREF> .

<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were very sad and were crying .
But <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">Mary</COREF> told <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> that <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> was alive .
<COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> said that <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> had seen <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> , but <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did not believe <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> .
Later , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> appeared to <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">two followers</COREF> while <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were walking in the country .
But <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> did not look the same as before <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was killed *-1 .
<COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">These followers</COREF> went back to <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the other followers</COREF> and told <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> what *T*-1 happened .
Again , <COREF ID="105" TYPE="IDENT">the followers</COREF> did not believe <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Later , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> appeared to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the eleven followers</COREF> while <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were eating .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> criticized <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> because <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had so little faith .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were stubborn and refused *PRO*-1 to believe the people who *T*-2 said 0 <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> had risen from death .
<COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , `` *PRO* Go everywhere in <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> .

And <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">the people who *T*-2 believe</COREF> will be able *PRO*-1 to do these things as proof : <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will use <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> name *PRO*-3 to force demons out of people .
<COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will speak in languages 0 <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> never learned *T*-1 .
If <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> pick up snakes or drink any poison , <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will not be hurt *-1 .
<COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will lay <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> hands on <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">sick people</COREF> , and <COREF ID="143" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will get well . ''
After <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="147" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Lord</COREF> <COREF ID="147" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jesus</COREF></COREF> said these things to <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> followers</COREF> , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was carried *-1 up into heaven .
There , <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> sat at the right side of <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">The followers</COREF> went everywhere in <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> *PRO*-1 telling people <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the Good News</COREF> , and <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> helped <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
