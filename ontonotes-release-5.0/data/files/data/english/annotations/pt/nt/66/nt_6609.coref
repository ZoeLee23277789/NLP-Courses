<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The fifth angel</COREF> blew <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> trumpet .
Then <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> saw <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">a star</COREF> fall from the sky to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> .
<COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">The star</COREF> was given *-1 the key to <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the deep hole that *T*-2 leads down to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the bottomless pit</COREF></COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the star</COREF> opened <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the hole leading to <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the pit</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">Smoke</COREF> came up from <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the hole</COREF> like smoke from a big furnace .
The sun and sky became dark because of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the smoke from <COREF ID="10" TYPE="IDENT">the hole</COREF></COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">locusts</COREF> came out of <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the smoke</COREF> and went down to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the earth</COREF> .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were given *-1 the power *PRO* to sting like scorpions .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were told *-1 *PRO*-2 not to damage the fields of grass or any plant or tree .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were *-1 to hurt <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">only those who *T*-2 did not have <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> mark on <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> foreheads</COREF> .

During those days <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> will look for <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">a way 0 *PRO* to die *T*-1</COREF> , but <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will not find <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will want *PRO*-1 to die , but death will hide from <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">The locusts</COREF> looked like horses prepared * for battle .
On <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> heads <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wore something that *T*-1 looked like a gold crown .

<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> teeth were like lions ' teeth .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> chests looked like iron breastplates .
The sound 0 <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> wings made *T*-1 was like the noise of many horses and chariots hurrying into battle .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">The locusts</COREF> had <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">tails</COREF> with stingers like scorpions .
The power 0 <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had *T*-1 *PRO* to give people pain for five months was in <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> tails</COREF> .
<COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> had <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">a ruler , who *T*-1 was the angel of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the bottomless pit</COREF></COREF> .
