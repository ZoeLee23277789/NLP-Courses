<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to know that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am trying very hard *PRO*-1 to help <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am trying *PRO*-1 to help <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">those in Laodicea and others who *T*-2 have never seen <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to be strengthened and joined *-1 together with love and to have the full confidence that *T*-2 comes from understanding .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to know completely <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the secret truth that <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> has made *T*-1 known</COREF> .
<COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">That truth</COREF> is <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> .
In <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are kept *-1 *PRO*-2 safe .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> tell <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> this so that no one can fool <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> by *PRO* telling <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ideas that *T*-1 seem good , but are false .
Even though <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am far away , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> thoughts are always with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am happy *PRO* to see <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> good lives and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> strong faith in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> accepted <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ Jesus</COREF> as Lord , so *PRO* continue *-1 to live *PRO*-2 following <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> must depend on <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> only , *PRO*-1 drawing life and strength from <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
Just as <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were taught *-1 <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the truth</COREF> , *PRO* continue *-2 to grow stronger in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> understanding of <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
And *PRO* never stop *-1 giving thanks to <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
*PRO* Be sure 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are not led *-1 away by <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the teaching of those who *T*-2 have nothing worth 0 *PRO* saying *T*-4 and only plan *PRO*-3 to deceive <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">That teaching</COREF> is not from <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> .
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is only human tradition and comes from the powers that *T*-1 influence <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">this world</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> say this because <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">all of God</COREF> lives in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> fully , even in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life on earth .
And because <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> belong to <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are complete , *PRO*-1 having everything 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> need *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> is ruler over every other power and authority .
In <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> had <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a different kind of circumcision</COREF> , <COREF ID="90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one that *T*-1 was not done *-2 by human hands</COREF></COREF> .
That is , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were made *-1 free from the power of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> sinful self .
<COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is the kind of circumcision 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> does *T*-1 .
When <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were baptized *-2 *T*-1 , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were buried *-3 with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were raised *-4 up with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> because of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> faith in <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> power</COREF> .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> power</COREF> was shown *-1 when <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> raised <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> from death *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> were spiritually dead because of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> sins and because <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were not free from the power of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> sinful self .
But <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> gave <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> new life together with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> forgave all <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> sins .
Because <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> broke <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> laws , <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> owed <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="135" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">a debt</COREF> -- <COREF ID="135" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a debt that *T*-1 listed all the rules 0 <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> failed *-3 to follow *T*-2</COREF></COREF> .
But <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> forgave <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> of <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">that debt</COREF> .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> took <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> away and nailed <COREF ID="134" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">the cross</COREF> .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> defeated <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">the rulers and powers of the spiritual world</COREF> .
With <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">the cross</COREF> <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> won the victory over <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and led <COREF ID="147" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> away as defeated and powerless prisoners 0 for the whole world to see *T*-1 .
So *PRO* do n't let anyone make rules *ICH*-1 for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> about *PRO* eating and drinking or about <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Jewish customs</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="160" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">festivals , New Moon celebrations , or Sabbath days</COREF> -RRB- .
In the past these things were like a shadow that *T*-1 showed what *T*-2 was coming .
But the new things that *T*-2 were coming are found *-1 in <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> .
<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">Some people</COREF> enjoy *PRO*-1 acting as if <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are humble and love *PRO* to worship angels .
<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> always talk about the visions 0 <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have seen *T*-1 .
*PRO* Do n't listen to <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> when <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are wrong because <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do n't do these things *T*-1 .
It *EXP*-1 is so foolish for <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to feel <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">such pride</COREF> , because <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is all based *-2 on <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own human ideas .
<COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do n't keep <COREF ID="170" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> *PRO*-1 under the control of the head .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> is the head , and <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the whole body</COREF> depends on <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
Because of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> all the parts of <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> care for each other and help each other .
So <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the body</COREF> is made *-1 stronger and held *-1 together as <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> causes <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to grow .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> died with <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> and were made *-1 free from the powers that *T*-2 influence <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">this world</COREF> .
So why do <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> act as if <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> still belong to <COREF ID="206" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> mean , why do <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> follow <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">rules like these : ``</COREF>
*PRO* Do n't eat this , '' `` Do n't taste that , '' `` Do n't touch that '' ?
<COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">These rules</COREF> are talking about <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">earthly things that *T*-1 are gone *-2 after <COREF ID="218" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are used *-3</COREF> .
<COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are only human commands and teachings .
<COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">These rules</COREF> may seem *-1 to be wise as part of a made - up religion in which <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> pretend *PRO*-3 to be humble and punish <COREF ID="225" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bodies *T*-2 .
But <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't help people stop *-1 doing the evil that the sinful self wants *PRO*-3 to do *T*-2 .
