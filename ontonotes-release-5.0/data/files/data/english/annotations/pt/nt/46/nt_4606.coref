When one of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> has something against someone else in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> group</COREF> *T*-1 , why do <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> go to <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">the judges in the law courts</COREF> *T*-2 ?
The way 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> think and live *T*-1 is wrong .
So why do <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> let <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> decide who *T*-2 is right *T*-1 ?
Why do n't <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> let <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> holy people</COREF> decide who *T*-2 is right *T*-1 ?
Do n't <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know that <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> people</COREF> will judge <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> ?
So if <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will judge <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> , then surely <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> can judge small arguments like this .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> know that in the future <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> will judge angels .
So surely <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can judge life 's ordinary problems .
So if <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">such matters 0 *T*-1 to be judged *-2</COREF> , why do <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> take <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-4 are not part of the church</COREF> *T*-3 ?
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> mean nothing to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> say this *PRO*-1 to shame <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
Surely there is someone *ICH*-1 in <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> group</COREF> wise enough *PRO* to judge a complaint between two believers .
But now one believer goes to court against another , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> let people who *T*-1 are not believers judge their case !
The lawsuits that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have *T*-1 against each other show that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are already defeated *-2 .
It *EXP*-1 would be better for <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> to let someone wrong <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 would be better *PRO* to let someone cheat <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are the ones <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">doing</COREF> wrong and cheating .
And <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> own brothers and sisters in <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> !
Surely <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know that people who *T*-2 do wrong will not get *PRO*-1 to enjoy <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> kingdom</COREF> .
*PRO* Do n't be fooled *-1 .
These *ICH*-3 are <COREF ID="nt_4606.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the people who *T*-1 will not get *PRO*-2 to enjoy <COREF ID="82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> kingdom</COREF></COREF> : <COREF ID="86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">those who *T*-4 sin sexually , those who *T*-5 worship idols , those who *T*-6 commit adultery , <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">men who *T*-7 let other men use <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> for sex or who *T*-8 have sex with other men</COREF> , those who *T*-9 steal , those who *T*-10 are greedy , those who *T*-11 drink too much , those who *T*-12 abuse others with insults , and those who *T*-13 cheat</COREF></COREF> .
In the past <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">some of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF></COREF> were like <COREF ID="nt_4606.part-000.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were washed *-1 *PRO*-2 clean , <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were made *-3 holy , and <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> were made *-4 right with <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> in the name of <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord Jesus Christ</COREF> and by <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the Spirit of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> God</COREF></COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am allowed *-2 to do anything , '' <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> say *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> answer to this is that not all things are good .
Even if it *EXP*-1 is true that `` <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am allowed *-2 to do anything , '' <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will not let anything control <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> like a slave .
Someone else says , `` Food is for the stomach , and the stomach for food . ''
Yes , and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> will destroy them both .
But the body is not for sexual sin .
The body is for <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> , and <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> is for the body .
And <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> will raise <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> bodies from death with the same power 0 <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> used *T*-1 to raise <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord Jesus</COREF> .
Surely <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> bodies are parts of <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Christ <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF></COREF> .
So <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> must never take what *T*-1 is <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">part of <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF></COREF> and join <COREF ID="165" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to a prostitute !
The Scriptures say , `` The two people will become one . ''
So <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> should know that anyone who *T*-1 is joined *-2 with <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">a prostitute</COREF> becomes one with <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> in body .
But anyone who *T*-1 is joined *-2 with <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the Lord</COREF> is one with <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in spirit .
So *PRO* run away from <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">sexual sin</COREF> .
<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> involves the body in a way that no other sin does *T*-1 .
So if <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> commit sexual sin , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are sinning against <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> own body .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> should know that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> body is a temple for <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">the Holy Spirit that <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> received *T*-1 from <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> and that *T*-2 lives in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> do n't own <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">yourselves</COREF> .
<COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> paid a very high price *PRO* to make <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> .
So *PRO* honor <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> body .
