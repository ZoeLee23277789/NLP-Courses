Every Jewish high priest is chosen *-1 from among men .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">That priest</COREF> is given *-1 the work of *PRO* helping <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> with the things 0 <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must do *T*-2 for <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> must offer to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> gifts and sacrifices for sins .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">The high priest</COREF> has <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own weaknesses .
So <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is able *PRO*-1 to be gentle with <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-2 do wrong out of ignorance</COREF> .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> offers sacrifices for <COREF ID="17" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sins , but <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> must also offer sacrifices for <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own sins .
*PRO* To be a high priest is an honor .
But no one chooses himself for this work .
<COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">That person</COREF> must be chosen *-1 by <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> just as Aaron was *?* .
It is the same with <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did not choose <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> *PRO*-1 to have the honor of *PRO* becoming a high priest .
But <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> chose <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> said to <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> , `` <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> Son .
Today <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have become <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> Father . ''
And in another part of the Scriptures <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> says , ``
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are a priest *ICH*-1 forever -- the kind of priest 0 <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Melchizedek</COREF> was *T*-2 . ''
While <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Christ</COREF> lived on earth <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> prayed to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> , *PRO*-1 asking for help from <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the one who *T*-2 could save <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> from death</COREF> .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> prayed to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> with loud cries and tears .
And <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> prayers were answered *-1 because of <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> great respect for <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">Jesus</COREF> was the Son of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> , but <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still suffered , and through <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> sufferings <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> learned *PRO*-1 to obey whatever <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> says *T*-2 .
This made <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> the perfect high priest , who *T*-1 provides the way 0 for everyone who *T*-4 obeys <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> to be saved *-3 forever *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> made <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> high priest , just like <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Melchizedek</COREF> .
We have many things 0 *T*-1 to tell <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> about this .
But it *EXP*-1 is hard *PRO* to explain because <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have stopped *-2 trying *PRO*-3 to understand .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> have had enough time that by now <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> should be teachers .
But <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> need someone 0 *T*-1 to teach <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> again the first lessons of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">God 's</COREF> teaching .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> still need the teaching that *T*-1 is like milk .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are not ready for solid food .
Anyone who *T*-2 lives on milk is still a baby and is not able *PRO*-1 to understand much about *PRO* living right .
But solid food is for <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">people who *T*-1 have grown up</COREF> . -RAB-
From <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> experience <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have learned *PRO*-1 to see the difference between good and evil .
