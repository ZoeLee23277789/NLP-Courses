You know <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm thinking a lot about <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">this job that <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> just took *T*-1 that you know <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> seem *-2 to think 0 *T*-3 is a dead end and obviously does n't make enough money</COREF>

And <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> just tried for the longest time *PRO*-1 to figure out what *PRO* to do *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">Liz</COREF> , <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">Liz</COREF> , <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't know whether <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> made a mistake or not .
<COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> ca n't possibly tell .

And <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> will find out .
And if it 's a b- huge mistake <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> 'll just quit ,
that 's all .
<COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">You</COREF> have no way of *PRO* knowing .

No
<COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> did n't tell <COREF ID="75" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> anything .
oh okay .
Is <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> e- is <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> really such an awful job ?
*PRO* Sounded to <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> like a lot of interesting things .
*PRO* Sounded to <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> like too much
but <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> sounded like a very interesting set of things .
Is <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> something 0 <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> definitely d- would not want *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">You</COREF> had said 0 <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was an eas- <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">You</COREF> had said <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> had said 0 <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was an easier job in some ways .
What ?
Actually <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't think so anymore because <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="77" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's too many things .
Are y- are <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> going *-1 to have *-2 to for either one of them are <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> going *-3 to have *-4 to <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">spend</COREF> hours *PRO*-5 preparing outside of the hours that <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> actually get paid *-6 for *T*-7 ?
<COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't know yet .
Because <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't think that <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would be warranted *-1 -- -- at at at the salary that they 're giving *T*-2 <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> .
<COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> ought *-1 to be able *PRO*-2 to circumscribe <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">your</COREF> hours very carefully .

And <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> knew 0 it was obviously because what <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> really wanted *PRO*-1 to do *T*-2 was *PRO* go into <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">biophysics</COREF> but also have <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">my</COREF> own little kids .
But <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> went into <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT">biophysics</COREF> .
By the end of the year <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'd met <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">Daddy</COREF>
and <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> decided 0 that was going *-1 to be it .

<COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">Daddy</COREF> was really going *-1 to be the one .
<COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> got very unhappy with the science .
and <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> just walked out of one lab
and <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> said no this is it .
<COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> just do n't want it .
<COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to be teaching little kids .
Because <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">Daddy</COREF> was at that point noncommittal *PRO* to say the least .
And %um and <COREF ID="183" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was also leaving for Syracuse .
And so <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">a friend of <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">mine</COREF></COREF> *ICH*-1 sat down with <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> , <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">Wayne Meyers</COREF>
and <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was a very bright guy .
<COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was the one 0 <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> cried whose shoulder <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> cried on *T*-1 when <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> took <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">Dexadrin</COREF> that time too for

%um and <COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said to <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> really want *PRO*-1 to change .
<COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> said yeah <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> really want *PRO*-1 to go .
<COREF ID="212" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says well *PRO* take the bus across <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">the river</COREF> this afternoon because <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> had already applied *RNR*-2 and been accepted *-1 *RNR*-2 to the

And <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> did n't apply to any other ed schools because <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> figured 0 <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> could get in in there which <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> had *?* *T*-1 .
And <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> went across <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT">the river</COREF> that day
and <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> said can <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> get into <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> next year 's class .
And <COREF ID="245" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> said absolutely .

<COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> could n't just study science for a while .
And <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> was twenty - two . Twenty - one .
And and %um yeah <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> guess 0 <COREF ID="340" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> was twenty - two already .
%um and %um a- and and a- a- it 's it 's not any rational kind of thing <COREF ID="339" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">Liz</COREF> .
