So , how are <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm fine .
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm very fine .
How are <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> have n't talked to <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> in a long time .
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> feel like <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 've ta- <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> talk *PRO*-1 to David almost every day .
yeah
Is n't that wild ?
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't know what it
there 's really no difference between between *PRO* writing a letter and and the way 0 <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> correspond *T*-1 .
As a matter of fact , what <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do *T*-1 is <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> sit down and write <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">a letter</COREF> at <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">my</COREF> own leisure , you know , at at the word processor
and then late at night <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> send <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> over , you know the online , ov- on <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">email</COREF> --
Right
-- and there 's really no reason why <COREF ID="38" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> could n't have written <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">letters like <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF></COREF> all these years and put <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in the mailbox *T*-1 .
Well , you know what
<COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't know
there 's <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">something about <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> that *T*-1 's easier</COREF> ,
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't know how *PRO* to d- explain <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 .
That <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> find 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the email</COREF> is easier ?
yeah ,
it 's this <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> guess that <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's no different except that you do n't have *-1 to go out and get stamps and put it in the mailbox .
<COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> think also that you know that someone 's going *-1 to be reading <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> the next day , not possibly in a week .
You know that you know that what you 're saying *T*-1 is going *-2 to be heard *-3 .
Sometimes when you write <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">a letter</COREF> *T*-1 you figure 0 eventually they 're going *-2 to get <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's already going *-3 to be old news
and you know 0 <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> it 's more of a communica- you feel like you 're really communicating with <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">email</COREF> .
yeah .
Kind of ,
even though it 's %eh even though there is a delay .
But it <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't know , it 's like cute .
Also <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> get a <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> get a kick out of *PRO* pressing all those buttons and everything .
So * tell <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> .
okay ,
first what <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> have
*PRO* to start off * tell <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> about <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">all <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">your</COREF> kids</COREF> .
*PRO* Start at the beginning .
Or should <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF>
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'll start at the end .
okay .
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">Avi</COREF> is very cute .
yeah
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's like , %um , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> nine months old already .
oh , my God .
*PRO* Believe <COREF ID="111" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> or not .
What 's <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> doing *T*-1 ?
*PRO* Tell <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> every-
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's not really like <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's only like seven months old .
Right .
But the truth is , 0 like <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">all <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">my</COREF> children</COREF> , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's really only like five months old .
<COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's a lump on a log . <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> would be surprised
oh <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's very alert ,
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's very alert and %um and very responsive and laughs and eats well .
Hello ?
No , <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm here ,
<COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> just do n't want *PRO*-1 to interrupt because <COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> hate that echo thing .
okay .
okay .
%ah , and %uh but <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't move .
okay ,
well <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's normal ,
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> 're not worried about <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF>
That 's <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">all <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">your</COREF> kids</COREF>
No
but you know because because <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was premature , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's getting a lot of attention .
Right .
So we go ph- to <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">physical therapy</COREF> once a week ,
and the truth is 0 what <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm learning *T*-1 about <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> oh because <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> spend so much time with the physical therapist is that <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">all <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">my</COREF> kids</COREF> could have used physical therapy in this case .
The truth is 0 <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> could all use <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">physical therapy</COREF> because <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would all make <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> more balanced *ICH*-2 people between the right *RNR*-1 and <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> left *RNR*-1 hemispheres
and something about *PRO* being organized internally gets you organized ext-
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 've learned <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">a lot</COREF> .
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't know
half of <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is probably baloney ,
but if any of <COREF ID="172" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's true <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">they <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">all</COREF></COREF> needed physical therapy .
At a very young age .
oh god .
How often do <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> have *-1 to take <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-2 ?
No
because they do n't like *PRO*-1 to pl-
How often do <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> take <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> take <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> once a week
<COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm sorry ,
what ?
Once a week .
Once a week .
okay .
mhm
%um and , %uh <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't like *PRO*-1 to play on <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> stomach ,
<COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> only likes *PRO*-1 to be on <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> back</COREF> .
Right .
So as soon as you put <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> on <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can lift <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> head and everything
and and now <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's starting *-1 to extend <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hands out even
Right
but <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> just as soon as <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">that toy</COREF> , <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> just rolls over *PRO*-1 to play with <COREF ID="214" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> on <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> back</COREF> .
oh .
So %uh .
No ,
but <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> %uh <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were all like that , every o- <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">every one of <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> .
So <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> do n't think 0 it personally it has anything 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with <COREF ID="107" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> being premature ?
Personally , no .

No .
But it does n't hurt .

You know , they prepared <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> for that and said oh you know , but because millions of kids here have <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> Right a lot of kids and a lot of Hagim a lot of %uh preemi- preemies get <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .

<COREF ID="231" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> know .
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Jochanan</COREF> liked <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF>
<COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Jochanan</COREF> liked <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> pretty much right away .
<COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">Everyone</COREF> you know <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> invested so much in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , too .
At the beginning we did n't have any of the , %um , it was as if there was <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">a novelty</COREF> , because they waited so long *PRO*-1 to bring <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> home .
mhm
Right .
And then you know <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the novelty</COREF> 's worn off , which *T*-1 is good .
Right
<COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> wore off a long time ago .
And <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> says %uh you know i- th- <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">lots of people</COREF> have babies in <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> houses .
It 's you know , they 're just another family with a baby in the house .
Right .
And <COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was good .
<COREF ID="110" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's the way 0 it should be *T*-1 .
w- d- How do <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> have the kids in the house *T*-1 ?
Who 's *T*-1 in which room ?
Well , <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Uriel</COREF> was in <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">a room</COREF> before <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Gabby</COREF> came home .
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Uriel</COREF> was in <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">a room</COREF> by <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> .
mhm .
And <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">Noam</COREF> and <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">Jochanan</COREF> shared .

But before <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> brought <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the baby</COREF> home , <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> switched it , because <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">Uriel 's</COREF> room</COREF> was like a bacteria haven .
And <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> when <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> When <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> remember when <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> was <COREF ID="232" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> was up *T*-1 it was right a couple before a few weeks before <COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> brought <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> home
<COREF ID="120" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> cleaned out <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">the room</COREF> *PRO* to switch
