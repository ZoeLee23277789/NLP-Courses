and the language you know yeah . constantly like kind of
like <COREF ID="281" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> could be p- considered *-1 positive things as well
yeah
but <COREF ID="281" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean you mind as well think of <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in a negative vie- rather than
mhm sure
They just like *PRO*-1 worrying over <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Well you know and that 's why <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> it *EXP*-1 helps *PRO* to have kind of a glimpse into the future *T*-2 *PRO* right ?
And that 's how that 's how <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> got to -- %mm . -- <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Spain</COREF> in the first place *T*-2 is <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">live</COREF> abroad and <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> would try *PRO*-3 to do <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> you know as teachers

and <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> really feel that that 's important
and so what <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm having an idea of *T*-1 now is
okay you know <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">Emory</COREF> works on <COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> doctorate</COREF>
<COREF ID="81" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> takes about five or six years
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the kid</COREF> probably
<COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> <COREF ID="80" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> gets a research position somewhere in France or in <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Spain</COREF> %um
and then <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> move over there
and you know <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> take care of <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">the kid</COREF> and and do some you know little day labor whatever you know
we 'll see
%mm .
%um and <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> have relatively mellow life for who *T*-1 knows five or ten years
and then <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> take it from there .
yeah
because even like you know <COREF ID="281" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean all that stuff right is is all so subject to whatever change in the weather that *T*-1 happens *-2 to be *PRO* right ?
