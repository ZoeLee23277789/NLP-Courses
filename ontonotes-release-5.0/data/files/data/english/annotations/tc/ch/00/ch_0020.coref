like <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't cook anymore
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> have n't worked in the kitchen kitchen for a week already

really
So <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm not

and then anoth-
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> %um
Maybe here and there
but <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's really basically
What is <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> going *-1 to do *T*-2
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's going *-1 to be a teacher for %um High school computers
oh okay
yeah
so <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's only teaching three days a week
so <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> always says that on the other days if <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> need <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll come in
the truth is 0 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's been teaching and very patient and very good
and <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> also is great that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has written down everything
<COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm sure 0 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's thrilled *PRO*-1 to get out of there
Well <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'll tell <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> the truth %uh
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean now that <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> worked with <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> one to one <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> does do everything with <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> heart
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean it 's not 0 <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's just <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has a different head than everybody else
like <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> know that <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wants everything to be nice and to be good and
but <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's very separate
and <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> only <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't like *PRO*-1 to listen to other people 's %um ideas
but %um <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm sure 0 financially <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was probably great for the kibbutz because <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was cheap
yeah
because <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's also
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'll tell <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF>
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> worked with <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> <COREF ID="72" TYPE="IDENT">this whole week</COREF>
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't eat a thing ever
like all morning long
so <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't eat
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't drink coffee
<COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> do- <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> did n't see <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> drink anything water or anything else
one day <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> better drink something <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> have a headache because it was really hot
but <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean you know <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't eat anything
and then for lunch when we finally went *PRO*-1 to go *PRO*-2 get something 0 *PRO* to eat *T*-3 *T*-5 Also <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> eats like a little <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">What we would eat *T*-4 maybe half</COREF> for a meal
and <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's it
so <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> can understand now why <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thinks that *T*-1 because <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't have big eyes you know

or
well <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'll tell <COREF ID="236" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> the truth
until <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> made the decision <COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> was scared and also utz
<COREF ID="237" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> miss <COREF ID="194" TYPE="IDENT">the cooking part</COREF>
