uh-huh .
<COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> was furious .
And then <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">Guy</COREF> came
and <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was kind of a jerk <COREF ID="264" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> know .
<COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was kind of harsh with <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> and %um you know just sort of not very sensitive and did n't want *PRO*-1 to help with <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Joel</COREF> and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Jemma</COREF></COREF> at all .
We finally made <COREF ID="142" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> take <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> out for an afternoon .
<COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean it was all just in <COREF ID="264" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> know just ridiculous .
And it and it was n't so great with <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Eve</COREF> either .
<COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to spend <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">a day</COREF> with <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> .
uh-huh
so <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> set aside this so <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> w- you know <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> set aside <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the day 0 <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> told <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> *T*-1</COREF>
uh-huh
and it what it came down to *T*-1 was <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> going to <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> hairdresser</COREF> with <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> uh-huh and sitting there while <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> talked to <COREF ID="176" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> hairdresser</COREF> for an hour and a half . and then going out to lunch with <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> and <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> babysitter uh-huh Who *T*-2 brought <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the baby</COREF> *PRO*-3 to meet <COREF ID="201" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF></COREF>
and <COREF ID="263" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> thought that the reason 0 <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">the babysitter</COREF> was staying for lunch *T*-1 was because <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> would then take <COREF ID="196" TYPE="IDENT">the baby</COREF> away again
Right
But at the end of <COREF ID="198" TYPE="IDENT">lunch</COREF> , <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Eve</COREF> just told <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> *PRO*-1 to go home .
