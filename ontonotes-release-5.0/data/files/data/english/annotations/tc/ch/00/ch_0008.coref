Well <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> went out into the garden and sort of had an informal receiving line ,
and then everybody went up to North Park and changed clothes ,
and uh-huh . <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> played softball , and , %uh , volleyball , and four square , and had dancing and m- music and great food , and
Wow , that sounds like a lot of fun .
It was *?* .
Wow .
It sounds like it was great
yeah everybody , <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">a lot of people</COREF> told us 0 it was the best wedding 0 <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had ever been to *T*-1 ,
and that 's , <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> guess , the highest compliment 0 you can get *T*-1 .
Wow .
So ,
and where , did <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">you guys</COREF> go on a honeymoon *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> went on <COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">a honeymoon to <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">this island off the coast of Puerto Rico . oh god . In <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the Carribean</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
But i- , the hardest part was getting there .
<COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had *-1 to take three planes *PRO*-2 to get there .
But the
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> got <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">this book *ICH*-1</COREF> from <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> mom about <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the Carribean</COREF> .
And , %um . <COREF ID="168" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'd always wanted *PRO*-1 to go to <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">the Carribean</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> just decided okay , <COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'll go .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> only went for five days .
<COREF ID="40" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was pretty short
but , %um . uh-huh . <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">The place</COREF> was totally laid back .
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was this old plantation house that *T*-1 , %um , had this twenty - four rooms .
And , and , they said in <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the book</COREF> like you wo n't be able *PRO*-1 to tell the guests from the staff .
And mhm . %um , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was really , really cool .
And <COREF ID="ch_0008.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have , you know , i- , mismatched sheets and stuff .
<COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was n't fancy at all ,
but <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was really cheap .
And uh-huh <COREF ID="ch_0008.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> just had the bar open all the time .
You could go and get whatever you wanted *T*-1 and just write it on your guest ticket .
And oh my god . <COREF ID="ch_0008.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> picked fresh mangoes from the yard for breakfast , and stuff .
It was great .
Wow , <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> sounds idyllic .
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was really tiny ,
so ,
<COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">the island</COREF> is only ten miles long .
uh-huh .
%um . But it was , it was good cause i- , you know , everybody speaks English ,
and , and yet <COREF ID="95" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's still pretty exotic , you know .
uh-huh .
<COREF ID="37" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> went *PRO*-1 snorkeling .
And , it wa-
God , it sounds great .
That 's something 0 <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> really regret *T*-1 is that <COREF ID="115" TYPE="IDENT">Norm and <COREF ID="169" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF></COREF> did n't have a honeymoon .

<COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean it 's really weird .
Like <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> can see You can s- .

<COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's like this big circle

<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> started *-1 rolling that <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> can feel *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean they roll the whole time ,

and <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's totally bizarre .
It 's
Do <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have a name for <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , I mean like a , you know a joke name that <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> call <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *PRO*-2 *T*-1 ?
Like
No .
<COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 've heard some really good ones .
But The only one that <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> came up with *T*-1 was Thumper , cause <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> just kicks so much .
<COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> really an active baby .
Thumper .
Well <COREF ID="98" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's good .
yeah .
Healthy .
Well , also the monster child is *T*-3 the other thing 0 <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> call <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-2 *T*-1 .
The monster child .
Rosemary 's baby .
<COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> know .
Well , %um . Because <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">kicks</COREF> so much , <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's really , you know , <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's really annoying .
<COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean
Does <COREF ID="112" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> wake <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> up ?
No <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has n't woken <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> up yet ,
but if <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> wake up in the middle of the night , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does kick
and so you can feel <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *-1 kicking in the middle of the night if you wake up .
What if <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a girl ?
Well , <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's probably not a girl , because in <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> family</COREF> , it 's o- , if you go on both sides of <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> family</COREF> , and you look at all <COREF ID="139" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> first cousins , and everything , it 's like seventy five percent male .
%huh .
But <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> might be a girl .
<COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> was positive 0 <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was a girl .
Like the first three months , <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> was absolutely positive 0 <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was a girl .
And then <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> changed <COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">my</COREF> mind an-
now <COREF ID="53" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is a boy .
Well that 'll be a surprise then .
yeah ,
yeah .
<COREF ID="166" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't know .
Are <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> going *-1 to ask them *PRO*-2 not to tell <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> if <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> had
oh <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're not having an ultrasound .
uh-huh .
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="002">
Because it 's really like ,
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> went and looked up all this research .
There 's all this stuff .
<COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">You</COREF> 'll see when <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> get pregnant *T*-1 .
And , If , if <COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to know , *PRO* just send <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> email . Because <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> looked up a bunch of stuff ,
but , there 's all this research like on , there 's all different kinds of prenatal tests that you can get *T*-1 now .
It 's not just amnio ,
it 's like other stuff too .
uh-huh .
And then there 's also , %um , you know , the , the , %uh , the ultrasound .
But in fact , like if you look at the l , the la- , the latest research on <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">ultrasound</COREF> , it 's like , they really do n't know .
Like they assume that <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's safe , because , you know , they 've had <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> for twenty years , right .
And nothing has happened ?
They never
Ye- ,
well they do n't know .
They 've never really done any big studies on <COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> or anything .
But the but if you 're a normal , low ,
like there 's reasons 0 *PRO* to have an ultrasound *T*-1 .
And if you have *-1 to have <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">an ultrasound</COREF> , then <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a really good diagnostic tool , *PRO* right ?
Right .
But in a normal low risk pregnancy like <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">mine</COREF> <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not a good diagnostic tool at all .
Like , is they find as many , %um , false positives as they do *?* false negatives .
For , for spina bifida and stuff ?
Well the only thing 0 they can really check *T*-1 , they can check the heart .
uh-huh .
And then they can check *PRO*-1 to see if the baby has a brain .
And then they can do like yeah . But then they can do some measurements *PRO*-1 to see if the baby has , %um , %ah
Defects of various kinds .
Like <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Down 's Syndrome</COREF> .
Like sometimes y- .
But that 's not really very good .
Like amnio is the only sure way 0 *PRO* to find out *T*-1 .
Right .
But <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could give you like some indications that the baby might have <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Down 's</COREF> or something .
But <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people with low risk pregnancies .
So , yeah . <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> did n't bother *PRO*-1 getting one .
yeah ,
good .
<COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm sure 0 everything will be fine .
oh yeah .
And if it 's not *?* , it 's like , you know , <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> 're going *-1 to have *-2 to deal with it anyway .
Well what are you going *-1 to do *T*-2 <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean , if it 's not , like
and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did n't do any of the testing because , like , <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> , <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 've met like <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">three people *ICH*-1</COREF> since <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> got pregnant , where <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">the baby</COREF> had <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Down 's</COREF> *T*-2 , right .
<COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> found out 0 <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">the baby</COREF> had <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">Down 's</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> aborted <COREF ID="124" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="119" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> had ,
well , <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's not called *-1 *PRO*-2 abortion , <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's called *-3 *PRO*-4 termina-
<COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">Termination ,</COREF>
that 's right .
And <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> jus- , <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> just could n't have done <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> just .
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> talked about it a little bit ,
<COREF ID="219" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> know what <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean *T*-1 .
Like obviously <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't want <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">my</COREF> baby</COREF> to have a mental defect or anything like that .
But
But if <COREF ID="145" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does *?* , <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> 'll deal with it .
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> just could not have done <COREF ID="133" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
So it was n't worth *PRO* doing <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">the prenatal testing</COREF> . Because , you know
If you 're not going *-1 to abort anyway , then there 's no reason 0 *PRO* to have <COREF ID="157" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-2 .
yeah .
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean there are like some , there are some conditions that they can test for *T*-1 that *T*-2 are sort of incompatible with life .
Right .
But then <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> figured , well , <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'll just go through the nine months of pregnancy and then <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">the baby</COREF> will die when <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's born *T*-1 . You know .
If <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's like that .
yeah .
yeah ,
we had this friend .
<COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not supposed *-1 to scare <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> ,
it 's just because <COREF ID="181" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was on the topic .
But , %um , but , the baby died at like eight and a half months .
%mm .
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> know .
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> read so many of <COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">those stories</COREF> .
<COREF ID="191" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> just freak <COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> out .
You know .
And of course they make you have , give birth anyway .
You know 0 you ca n't have an
You have *-1 to *?* .
<COREF ID="220" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean what are .
