Great .
What should <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> talk about *T*-1 ?
Well <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> do n't know .
*PRO* Tell <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> what *T*-1 's going on in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> .
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> have n't seen <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the news</COREF> in ages .
Really ?
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">You</COREF> did d-
In <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the American news</COREF> <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> mean *T*-1
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> know what *T*-1 's going on in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF>
but
yeah .
Well *PRO* let <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> see .
What 's *T*-1 going on ? %uh
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">You</COREF> want <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> to just give <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> some headlines ?
yeah .
*PRO* Give <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> some headlines .
What 's <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> up to *T*-1 ?
up-
yeah .
<COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> was just going *-1 to say 0 <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> just came out yesterday with <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> %uh <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> statement concerning affirmative action .
uh-huh .
And , and basically <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has in the past said that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was not in favor of %uh you know of *PRO* making %um al- allowances strictly based * on race
but at the same time %uh the analysis in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the news</COREF> shall <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> say the conservative analysis in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the news</COREF> is that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">Clinton</COREF> just came out and said that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does n't believe in quota systems and in reverse discrimination but that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does believe that affirmative action is necessary *PRO* to move %uh you know <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">black Americans</COREF> forward and to give <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> the opportunities that <COREF ID="50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've been denied *-1 *T*-2 .
So <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's trying to , k- kind of walking a tight rope .
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">You</COREF> know what <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm saying *T*-1 ?
Right .
In other words l-
<COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> 's trying *PRO*-1 to please <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">everybody</COREF> .
yeah .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">'s</COREF> see if <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can make <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">everybody</COREF> happy
<COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's
Then <COREF ID="20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> just ends up *-1 making nobody happy .
<COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> 're right .
Because you know <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">affirmative action</COREF> is really under attack *ICH*-1 in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> on , from many different quarters right now .
And , and <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a big , <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a big issue because it 's supposed *-1 to be a gender , <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean not a gender a race
%uh color blind
we 're supposed *-1 to be race color blind
and yet it 's like <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">contractors that *T*-1 are bidding you know with a high bid or higher than -- the lowest bid</COREF> are still getting the contracts only because <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are of ethnic protected you know black or whatever .
And it 's really you know
Right .
And then , then so they 're taking lawsuits to <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> and all of this
so it 's
Wow .
Another thing that *T*-1 just came up was that <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> said that <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">the redistricting of the congressional districts <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">one of which</COREF> *T*-2 is in <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">Georgia</COREF></COREF> violated the Constitution because <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was based *-3 primarily on race .
There was you know a new
What did <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do *T*-1 i-
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were doing <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> because <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were trying *PRO*-1 to make <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> more e- like <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were trying *PRO*-2 to make <COREF ID="122" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> less segregated ?
<COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were trying *PRO*-1 to make the district majority black Americans
so therefore <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">drew</COREF> <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> %uh all the way across <COREF ID="131" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> .
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">You</COREF> see what <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm saying *T*-1 ?
oh right .
uh-huh .
<COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">a , a very narrow district</COREF>
and <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> created a majority black district which *T*-1 then elected a , a black representative
and then <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was challenged *-1 because it said well the only reason that <COREF ID="136" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has been done *-2 this way *T*-3 is just *PRO* to <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">ensure</COREF> that <COREF ID="129" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was majority black
and <COREF ID="146" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's not
right
you know
Hello ?
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm here .
okay .
Anyway
<COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm mulling all this over .
yeah .
<COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean it 's , it
So it 's interesting because <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had a discussion *ICH*-1 with <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">students</COREF> about %um because <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're doing a pre-departure orientation
so <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were , <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> had <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> hot topics discussion *ICH*-1 <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">today</COREF> where <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> break in small groups *T*-2
and <COREF ID="156" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> talked about like political correctness and racial prejudice and sexual harrassment , feminism and just like different topics that <COREF ID="158" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> might encounter *T*-1 in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">America where the people have different attitudes than here in <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">Russia</COREF> *T*-2</COREF> .
So that was one of the things kind of like that
But <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> have <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm not really up on what the attitude is *T*-1 in <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> because <COREF ID="259" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> have n't been there in so long .
Well there 's a lot of frustration <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> think *?* over the fact that there 're , there 're a number of evidences that the affirmative action program is in fact discriminating in the other direction
and people are saying *PRO* wait a minute .
Why do n't we just give <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">everybody</COREF> %uh %uh %uh an e- try *PRO*-1 to give <COREF ID="203" TYPE="IDENT">everybody</COREF> an equal shot *T*-2
and if <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">someone</COREF> feels that <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 've been discriminated against *-1 because of <COREF ID="207" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> race *PRO* go at it from the standpoint of , of *PRO* trying *PRO*-2 to remedy it through the courts rather than saying that government has *-3 to give X number of contracts to minority no matter what .
Right .
And as a result some %uh m- <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">some people</COREF> are getting contracts just because of the color of <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> skin
and you know what <COREF ID="258" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm saying *T*-1
it 's , it 's , it 's still
When <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> might not even be the most qualified *T*-1 .
e- either <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're , <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not even , <COREF ID="221" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're not the low bid
you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that *T*-1 meets the quality spec- specification .
Right .
And but now you 've , there have been several cases where clearly you know it was , <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't get it because <COREF ID="247" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just did n't were n't the right color skin *T*-1 .
So now is that Right . is <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> really remedying the situation
or is <COREF ID="252" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's creating a lot of %uh of %uh resentment ?
And %uh Right . it 's kind of too bad .
