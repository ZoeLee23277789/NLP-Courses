and %eh the job is supposed *-1 to be a <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">a two year commitment</COREF>
uh-huh .
But , and <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> was kind of like one of the things that <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm thinking 0 <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't know about *T*-1 *PRO* doing <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">a two year commitment</COREF> %eh you know all this sort of thing
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is was too long
or that <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was too short .
well -- no ,
<COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could be longer
so it 's not like <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was too short .
It was just . you know
<COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't know .
<COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't know what <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> was thinking *T*-1
but anyway so they 're like what if it was just a one year commitment
and <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> said well <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'll think about it
*PRO* kind of threw <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> off
and then <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> called later
and <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> asked <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">the director</COREF> if %um
<COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> said well would <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> be willing *PRO*-1 to
a first year %um area director makes seventeen thousand
and a second year area director makes eighteen thousand five hundred .
First year you get three weeks vacation .
Second year you get four weeks
and <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> said well would <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> be willing *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">hire</COREF> <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> as if <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> was coming in at a second year mhm . %um %eh at eighteen five with <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">four weeks of vacation</COREF>
and <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 yeah <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> w- <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would be willing *PRO*-1 to do <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
Wow <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's a lot of vacation .
yeah
<COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *?* which *T*-1 is wonderful
That 's great .
%mm . And that 's more important to <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> than money
so
Right
yeah
So , and <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> take <COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> get <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">the whole week from Chri- <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">Christmas</COREF> to New Year</COREF>
<COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's one of <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="159" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> weeks of vacation</COREF>
so it 's only mhm . you know in addition to <COREF ID="161" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF>
so . So anyway ,
And <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">the rest</COREF> you can take *T*-1 pretty much %eh when you want *T*-2
I mean you work <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> around <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">your schedule</COREF> .
Right .
yeah ,
you got *-1 to work <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> around <COREF ID="180" TYPE="IDENT">your schedule</COREF> which *T*-2 is
i- in you know summer is not *T*-1 a really good time 0 *PRO* to take <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-2 because you 're ending one year and starting the next year and you know doing a lot with the p- the volunteers coming in
mhm .
-- so <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'll probably try *PRO*-1 to take most of <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> before next summer ,
we 'll see .
mhm .
%um so <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> tho- <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> thought about it that day
and <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> ended up *-1 calling back and saying * okay <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm coming to Detroit
so It 's been really good since <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 've
<COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean actually <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> made <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">the decision</COREF>
and <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> thought oh God what am <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> doing *T*-1 you know

but within in a couple days <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> just felt really at peace with <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and remained so throughout the time that <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> prepared *PRO*-1 to leave *T*-2
and then ever since <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 've been here <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> keep *-1 thinking okay why am <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> so okay with <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> *T*-2
<COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm going *-1 to be falling apart any minute , *PRO* right you know ?
Because <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm really used to transition hitting <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> a little bit harder especially when <COREF ID="242" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> was so ambivalent about <COREF ID="213" TYPE="IDENT">the decision</COREF> *T*-1

<COREF ID="298" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean this was just the second weekend 0 <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> saw <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 've seen each other *T*-1
so <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's coming here over Labor Day weekend --

you know <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> has n't even been here yet .
<COREF ID="298" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> have n't seen <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> since the Fourth of July weekend
