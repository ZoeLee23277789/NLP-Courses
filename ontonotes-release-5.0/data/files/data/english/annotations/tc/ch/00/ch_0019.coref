So , anyway , how are <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> doing *T*-1 these days ?
Things are going very well .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> had mentioned before that , %um , that %uh , that %uh , that there 's a company *ICH*-1 *ICH*-3 now that <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">working</COREF> with *T*-2 %um , %uh , which *T*-4 is very much just , just <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">myself</COREF> and Guss .
oh .
And that %um
No , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> had n't mentioned <COREF ID="12" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
%eh , oh , okay .
okay , so %um
%eh <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> told <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> that <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> were leaving the company that <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> were at *T*-1 ,
and <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> were entertaining offers .
And , %uh
Well i- , well it *EXP*-2 seemed *-1 to make sense since <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> had <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">a client</COREF> *PRO* to , to just kind of <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">set</COREF> up <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">my</COREF> own company , of sorts .
So %um oh . So things are going extremely well .
So , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> had <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">one client who *T*-1 said that <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'd pay <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">me</COREF> a minimum amount</COREF> .
You know , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'd , <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> , %uh ,
there would be a minimum amount of work , of about %uh , a day a week *ICH*-2 for the next two three years . mhm . Which *T*-1 is sufficient *PRO* to pay all <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">my</COREF> bills then
so <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> decided that it *EXP*-1 would make sense *PRO* to do <COREF ID="49" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> .
And , %um and , %um , <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 've been getting substantially more work than then .
%mm .
So <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 'm quite pleased , quite pleased .
Well that 's good .
So , %um , so <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> have a bunch of %uh work that <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> need *-1 to do *T*-2 on <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">my</COREF> flat <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> .
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> 've been telling <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> that <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> needed *-1 to do <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">that roof atrium</COREF> for quite some time .
But , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should , %uh , <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should come out <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">this year</COREF> .
oh , well that 's good .
<COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> should be done *-1 in a few months .
oh , yeah
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> remember So <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> talking a little bit about <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> at one point .
yeah ,
yeah .
So <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> have no intentions of *PRO* coming over this way any time soon ?
%um . <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't see the finances occurring uh-huh , right . for a while .
%um , actually right at the moment <COREF ID="ch_0002.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">finances</COREF> are not <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">going</COREF> real well .
But %ah well . <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> am working on <COREF ID="ch_0002.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">that one</COREF> .
%uh .
It 's just But %um %uh , %uh , 0 the the the main reason for <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is 0 <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> had not really anticipated a few expenses that *T*-1 recently came up %ah . %uh , related * to a couple of burglaries that <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> had *T*-2 .
oh , harsh . Harsh .
yeah .
yeah ,
but , and .
Not a whole lot 0 <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> can do *T*-1 about <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> now .
Indeed . Indeed .
*PRO* have *-1 to <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">deal</COREF> with <COREF ID="101" TYPE="IDENT">the situation</COREF> .
And And
So <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's what <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm doing *T*-1 .
*PRO* Sounds good .
But %um Anyway , %uh One of the main reasons that <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 've been such a pathetic , %uh , correspondent *T*-1 has been <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">work</COREF> .
<COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 've actually been doing a lot of <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
oh wow .
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="001">
And %uh , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> turned in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> Master 's thesis</COREF> back in May ,
and <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm actually presently working on , %um , several , %uh , articles oh , okay . Impressive . from <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
yeah ,
actually it turns out that <COREF ID="11" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">one thing</COREF> , <COREF ID="11" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">one little bit in what <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> was doing *T*-1</COREF> , %uh , is going *-2 to turn out *-3 to be very important in the end . And , %uh , from what <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> had been reading *T*-4 in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the literature</COREF> .
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">You</COREF> see <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">the one very annoying thing about all of this</COREF> , was 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> advisor</COREF> has been in France for a year and a half .
yeah .
And <COREF ID="18" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> made *PRO* writing <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> thesis</COREF> very annoying because <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> know there was n't much discussion .
yeah .
yup ,
yup .
But , %um Anyway , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> had been kind of telling <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> that , <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> know , from <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> reading of <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the literature</COREF> , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> thought that <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">this one little alteration 0 <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> had made *T*-1 in <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> model</COREF> was kind of clever and unique .
mhm .
And <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> f- , made w- the one type of solution *ICH*-1 occur , which *T*-2 was seen *-3 experimentally ,
but none of the other models had , %uh , had *?* ?
Yes .
They basically , the- ,
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm looking at , %um , multi mode lasers .
And one of the things that they find *T*-1 experimentally are what they call *T*-2 *PRO*-3 anti phased , %uh , states , where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh . of the laser , you get an oscillation which *T*-5 is characterized *-6 by one frequency *T*-4 .
Yes .
okay .
If you look , i- if you separate out <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the different modes of the laser</COREF> mhm . and look at one of <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> , you get more than one frequency .
okay .
So what *T*-1 's happening is that <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">the modes</COREF> are oscillating out of phase so that <COREF ID="67" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> completely mask each other 's Exactly . %hm . oscillations on these other frequencies .
And And %uh you can With a pretty simple model you can find <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">that frequency</COREF> in a transient ,
but you ca n't find <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">that frequency</COREF> in a driven , %uh , frequency .
You ca n't find so that <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will sustain .
okay .
Yes .
So yeah , that <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">that particular frequency</COREF> according to most models damps out very quickly .
And so you should n't actually really be able *PRO*-1 to ever see <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
%hm .
The only thing is , that , when you do the experiment *T*-1 you see <COREF ID="85" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
*PRO* Got it ,
*PRO* got it .
<COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> see .
So , %um , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> found <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">a simple modification of the original formula , which *T*-1 unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty . And in most cases , %uh , insoluble</COREF> .
But yeah . <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> gives a driving term .
oh , okay .
So , it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">answer</COREF> , you just ca n't always write <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> down very easily *T*-1 .
Exactly .
oh wow .
So , so , so <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you-</COREF> , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> 're pushing forward the bounds of <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">theoretical laser laser , %uh , whatever <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-1 science</COREF> .
But
which , %um , *T*-1 is kind of interesting *PRO* considering that <COREF ID="121" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's not really <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> thing . . Indeed . Indeed . *PRO* Be- being an experimentalist , not a theorist .
But %um Indeed . oh wow . oh , impressive . But
So , so , so are , so are <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> going *-1 to get an article in Nature or something ?
%um , actually , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm not sure if <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're shooting for op- ,
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> think 0 Optics Letters is probably the one that <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 're shooting for *T*-1 , or else , perhaps , though <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't think 0 <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's quite that significant , would be <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">Phys Rev Letters</COREF> .
%hm .
But , %uh , <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to write a letter , and then a couple articles .
yeah .
%hm . impressive .
And <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> , <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't know how much <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> know *T*-1 about scientific literature ,
but letters <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> much more prestigious than , articles .
oh , okay .
oh , w- , <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> <COREF ID="175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> did n't realize <COREF ID="152" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
okay .
yeah ,
so that that 's why it 's actually a big deal *T*-1 is
<COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean , you know , *PRO* writing a couple of articles based * on your Master 's thesis , is , not at all unusual in Physics
and yeah . %uh , i- it 's the fact that <COREF ID="174" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> would be writing a letter that *T*-1 is the impressive part of it all .
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="002">
And what *T*-1 's actually kind of interesting is 0 <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> kept *-2 telling <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Neil</COREF> that <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> thought that this was kind of significant .
And <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Neil</COREF> kept *-1 writing back that <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> should tone this part of <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">the thesis</COREF> down that <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> have been seeing th- . You know , <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">see</COREF> the anti phased motion ,
and <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's true
<COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do *?* in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the transients</COREF>
And <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> was having a lot of trouble *PRO* getting across to <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> that all of the literature is in has this frequency in <COREF ID="16" TYPE="IDENT">the transients</COREF> Yes . %eh and not driven .
And , %uh , what *T*-1 happened was 0 after <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> had turned in <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> thesis</COREF> but before <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> saw <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Neil</COREF> again , <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> went to a conference in Rochester and there this was a big issue among <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">the people who *T*-2 were doing this work</COREF> , was , that <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> models could n't show <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> as a driven frequency ,
yet <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> experiments showed <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as a driven frequency .
oh cool .
And s- and so <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Neil</COREF> then -- Said oh just a second <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> -- like a week later came to Bryn Mawr
and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said , hey <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">Lowell</COREF> , we <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">got</COREF> *-1 to write this up .
Exactly .
And <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> was like , well <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 've been telling <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> <COREF ID="57" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Neil</COREF> .
Indeed .
So Cool . <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> 's Cool . <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's mostly the sort of stuff that <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm spending a lot of time on *T*-1 now . %um
Well <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 'll look good on <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">your</COREF> C V , <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">your</COREF> resume .
So so <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> might as well spend the time .
Yes , well ,
%uh , th- no , <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's definitely worth *PRO* doing . %um ,
and <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> would have been spending more time on <COREF ID="59" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> if it were n't for %uh *PRO* dealing with the burglary issues oh yeah but that <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 've been dealing with *T*-1 .
So are <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> still living in <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">that house in the middle of the park</COREF> .
Yes .
yeah , okay .
yeah .
<COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean the thing that *T*-1 i-
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">this place</COREF> is incredibly easy 0 *PRO* to break into *T*-2 if you want *PRO*-3 to *?* .
oh .
It 's not a question of whether or not , %uh you know , that , that was easy ,
it was just that no one really knew 0 <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was worth 0 *PRO* breaking into *T*-1 .
Exactly .
Exactly .
yeah .
And so the problem is that now <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> found out that <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's worth 0 *PRO* breaking into *T*-1 .
yeah .
And unfortunately .
Well , i- it 's kind of odd .
<COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 've stolen very weird things for the most part .
%hm .
A- as far
yeah
as a .
The first time 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> broke in *T*-1 , <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> what <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stole *T*-2 was just bizarre ,
mostly worthless stuff .
And , %uh %huh the most worthwhile thing *ICH*-1 as far as monetary value went that <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stole *T*-2 was <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the pre-amplifier of <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> stereo</COREF> . Unfortunately , because <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a nice pre-amplifier ,
<COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">an off board power supply which <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did n't steal *T*-1 , which *T*-3 makes <COREF ID="114" TYPE="IDENT">the thing that <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> **stoled** *T*-2</COREF> absolutely worthless</COREF> .
%huh .
So .
That 's bizarre . Bizarre .
So , so so when <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> broke in <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the second time</COREF> *T*-1 did <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> steal the %uh , <COREF ID="130" TYPE="IDENT">the %uh offboard amplifier</COREF> ?
Actually , no ,
all 0 <COREF ID="108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> stole *T*-1 <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">the second time</COREF> was *T*-2 <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> bike .
%huh .
Which *T*-1 was actually where the major problem came *T*-2 . Exactly . Exactly . yeah . Is that <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> suddenly had no transportation .
And so , <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> then had *-1 to go <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">bike hunting</COREF> and eventually get <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">another bike</COREF> ,
and %mm . <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="140" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> cost <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> a lot of time .
yeah .
Exactly .
Because ,
yes
Spending a lot of time *PRO* hunting for bikes , and nah well . then getting <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">one</COREF> purchased *-1 , and then having * to , you know , go *PRO* get <COREF ID="150" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and things like that .
But , <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's dealt with *-1 at least .
And so %uh , <COREF ID="155" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's yeah at least dealt with *-1 .
Now <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> just have *-1 to work on the financial aspects of all of this .
But yeah . yeah .
At least Well that would make sense during <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the summer</COREF> <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> can actually , %uh according to the stipulations of <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> grant , or <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> fellowship , <COREF ID="173" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> can actually earn money during <COREF ID="163" TYPE="IDENT">the summer</COREF> .
