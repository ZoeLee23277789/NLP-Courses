*PRO* Go ahead .
Well <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm still working there you know
and %uh <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> got a <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm on <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">a pretty good project</COREF> .
Right .
<COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">A long a long term %uh next generation %uh fighter plane .</COREF>
Really ?
So <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's %uh kind of good experience <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> guess 0 *T*-1 .
uh-huh .
And %uh <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">Westinghouse</COREF> supposedly is making a bid *PRO* to buy <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">the %uh C B S broadcasting network</COREF> .
<COREF ID="224" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> bought <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> already .
Well , you know , th- it *EXP*-1 's takes months *PRO* to close a deal

And wh- wh- and what would *T*-1 happen with <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> guess 0 <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> 'd be sold *-1 to another company and see what *T*-2 happens .
<COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't know .
mhm .
<COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm not too concerned about <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> though
but <COREF ID="97" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a possibility .
But Have <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> %uh have <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> y- have a senior position there .
Well , <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> suppose so .
But , you know . <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do n't really think of it that way
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> look <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just look at the numbers how many people <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *T*-1 and how many people <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's just a business .
Right .
<COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just get rid *-1 of what <COREF ID="7" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't want *T*-2 .
uh-huh .
But %uh <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's <COREF ID="118" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's still going pretty well .
%huh
nothing really new with <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the h- house</COREF> or anything
We 've had <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">some interesting incidents with <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">wasps that *T*-1 have %uh been invading the neighborhood</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> started <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> <COREF ID="127" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> built a nest in <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> rafters of <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> house</COREF> and busted through .

And <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't know how *PRO* to %uh handle <COREF ID="153" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> *T*-1 .
But how come th- how come how come <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't help <COREF ID="223" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> ?
It does n't make a difference .
<COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're only going *-1 to you 're still going *-2 to go *PRO*-3 broke whether <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> help you or not .
