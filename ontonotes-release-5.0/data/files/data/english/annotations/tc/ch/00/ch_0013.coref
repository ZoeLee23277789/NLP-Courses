<COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> know .
And if <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> were nursing <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the baby</COREF> while <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> were <COREF ID="189" TYPE="IDENT">skydiving</COREF> <COREF ID="148" TYPE="IDENT">the baby</COREF> would be like okay .

That 's what <COREF ID="199" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> thought *T*-1 too .
And <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't need that many clothes when <COREF ID="193" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're that young *T*-1 .

<TEXT PARTNO="001">
<COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">You</COREF> know basically <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> do n't need *-1 to bring anything . But %uh but you know <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">your</COREF> two boobs</COREF> .
and %uh And since <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> ca n't really go anywhere without <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> anyhow
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> 're hard 0 *PRO* to forget *T*-1

*PRO* Do n't
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> did *?*
one time <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were like <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were travelling in the car
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> were like oh <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> can just bring a little mini diaper pail and all .
yeah .
That was after one time
<COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> went never again .

No .
No .
Somehow like <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> read too many of the books
so <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> thought 0 it was like no formula .
It does make a difference
like <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> always thought 0 formula smells kind of disgusting
oh yeah .
Like when <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> throw up *T*-1 it smells disgusting
and when <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> make <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> little doo - doo's</COREF> *T*-1 <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> smells grosser if <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're on formula .
But if <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're totally breast milk now <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> 'll find this hard this believe but if <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're totally breast milk for like the first couple months -- mhm . <COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="45" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> number twos</COREF> do n't smell at all .
oh okay .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do n't smell like anything .
It 's like <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> looks like shit but <COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't smell like anything .
oh okay .
And did <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> pump or not ?

Did <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> use a manual or a %uh did <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> get one of those little battery ones ?
<COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">Batter- Battery operated deal .</COREF>
yeah .
<COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">I</COREF> think so too .
Now like <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> can tell <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF>
<COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> can find the exact brand name of <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> if <COREF ID="290" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_B">you</COREF> want some time .
But like <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had like <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">this little like nozzle attachment thing *ICH*-1</COREF> on <COREF ID="87" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> which *T*-2 was what <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> said 0 you were supposed *-3 to use *T*-4 .
mhm .
mhm .
And <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">used</COREF> <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> the first time for like three seconds
<COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> was like -- -- %ah *PRO* get <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">this thing</COREF> off <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">me</COREF> .
<COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> really hurt .
*PRO* Do n't ever do <COREF ID="99" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> again .
And <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> forget what <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was for *T*-1
<COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> said 0 <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was for if you had small breasts or something .
<COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> do n't know what
oh okay .
so like <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> took <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">that thing</COREF>
and <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> threw <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> away .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was like a little part 0 you put *T*-1 on top of a nozzle thing .
<COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was just like an extra attachment
and <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> took <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF>
and <COREF ID="289" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> -- mhm okay . -- threw <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> away
