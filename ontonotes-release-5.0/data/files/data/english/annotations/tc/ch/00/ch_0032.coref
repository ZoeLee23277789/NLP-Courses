<COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">You</COREF> 've already graduated , *PRO* right ?
No ,
see <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm working on like three degrees at one time
so it 's going *-1 to be another three years before <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> graduate . oh . Unless <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> just decide *PRO*-3 to give up and just take what <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 've got *T*-2 .
So what do <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF> have *T*-1 so far ?
or do <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">you</COREF>
Well right now if <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF>
<COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> could graduate with <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT">a <COREF ID="unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">German</COREF> degree</COREF> right now
mhm .
but <COREF ID="248" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">German</COREF> degree</COREF> is useless . Right . Unless you get a P h D or something .
mhm .
So , <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> 'm also working on an <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> degree because <COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">my</COREF> real interest .
<COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">You</COREF> really
<COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> literature and not li- literature , *PRO* right ?

oh wow .
and that 's why <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> really think that like eng- <COREF ID="267" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> and <COREF ID="unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">German</COREF></COREF> goes together really well i- if you 're interested in medieval *T*-1 %mm . because %um in the past <COREF ID="267" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="256" TYPE="IDENT">English</COREF> and <COREF ID="unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">German</COREF></COREF> used *-2 to be the same language like about the year before the year seven hundred .
Wow .
You know , because like in Europe it was all like <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">wandering pagan tribes</COREF> and <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> just like %um <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> came you know <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> came down <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">the Goths and all them</COREF>
mhm .
like <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> used *-1 to <COREF ID="301" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Speaker_A">I</COREF> mean <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> spoke <COREF ID="293" TYPE="IDENT">Germanic language</COREF>
and some of <COREF ID="280" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> settled in Germany
and some people kept on *-1 walking and kept on *-1 going to England
and so <COREF ID="293" TYPE="IDENT">the language</COREF> gradually changed after that
Wow .
