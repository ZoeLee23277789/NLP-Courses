Next week , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">God</ENAMEX> willing , the water and electricity bills will start to be distributed in one bill .
The Minister of Water and Electricity will be available in the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Company for Electricity</ENAMEX> -LRB- in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Kharis</ENAMEX> service area in the Roda district -RRB- to launch the start of distribution , after the implementation of the project is completed without any media fuss , in order to avoid public opinion , which causes a big fuss , refusing this merge .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> Channel started preparing for the issue two days ago and asked citizens about their opinion on consolidating the water and electricity bills .
The only reason for their merge is very , very silly ; namely , the designation of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Ministry of Water and Electricity</ENAMEX> by this name requires also a consolidated bill for water and electricity .
The fine for disconnecting the electricity meter and turning back the reading is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">ten riyals</ENAMEX> , and the fine for pilfering water is <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">two hundred riyals</ENAMEX> .
Will the fine for pilfering water be consolidated with the electricity one to be <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">ten riyals</ENAMEX> ?
Brother , what are the repercussions of these bills on a large section of citizens who can barely pay the electricity bill itself ?
Why should you care about the water and electricity bill ?
Did n't this minister see the women sitting in front of the entrance to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Kharis</ENAMEX> Services with the electricity bills in their hands , pleading for the reviewers to help them pay them ?
The news is correct and 100 % confirmed , for correspondence .
