    On her agenda is a set of proposals and directives supported by Israel, intended to offer some concessions, the most
    important of which is to choke and besiege the resistance in order to make the Zionist project, the so-called New or
    Greater Middle East, succeed, particularly after the American-Israeli fears resulting from the Israeli defeat in the
    latest war in Lebanon, and the rise in the stardom of the resistance which has become a popular heritage after we
    swallowed cups of humiliation and shame from America.
