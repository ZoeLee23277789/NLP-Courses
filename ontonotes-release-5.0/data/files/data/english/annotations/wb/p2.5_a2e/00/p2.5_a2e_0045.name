In a press interview , the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Prime Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ehud Olmert</ENAMEX> said that major democratic countries with nuclear capabilities , such as <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the United States</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">France</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Russia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> , do not threaten to exterminate and crush states and nations .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olmert</ENAMEX> was referring to <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ahmedinejad</ENAMEX> 's statements about wiping <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> off the map ... but what is significant here in these statements is the mention of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> as one of the major countries in the nuclear club , although this is not true from a procedural point of view .
However , this is the first time an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israel</ENAMEX> official , represented in the form of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> Prime Minister , has formally mentioned that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> possesses nuclear weapons .
While this came as no surprise to everyone near and far , this announcement disturbed and angered various <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> forces , some of whom went about calling for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Olmert</ENAMEX> 's resignation .
Since <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> started its nuclear program in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the sixties</ENAMEX> with <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">French</ENAMEX> assistance , it has been shrouded in mystery .
Voices emerged out of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> strongly denying the existence of any <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Israeli</ENAMEX> nuclear weapons on the basis that no nuclear test explosions had been conducted inside <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> .
This is where an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> stance was needed but everyone greeted the news coolly and calmly , as if the whole issue was of no concern to us , whether closely or remotely , or as if <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> were located at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the North Pole</ENAMEX> .
An issue such as this really calls for an <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> position to be taken and anger to be expressed but it is as if <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> anger towards <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> is not allowed and is something that is forbidden to us .
The least requirement is to engage the international community in pressuring <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Israel</ENAMEX> into signing the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , which the majority of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Islamic</ENAMEX> countries have signed , including <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Egypt</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Iran</ENAMEX> .
