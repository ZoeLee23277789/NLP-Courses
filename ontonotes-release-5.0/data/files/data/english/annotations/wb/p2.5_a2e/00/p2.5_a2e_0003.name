I can not assume the personality a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> , especially one from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> , but I will describe some of the daily features of the demonstrations .
The crowd mixture of demonstrations is made up of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite Lebanese</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">some Christian followers of Aoun</ENAMEX> .
Of course , we do not forget our <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrian</ENAMEX> brothers .
A demonstrator is paid the sum of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">twenty American dollars</ENAMEX> daily , equivalent to <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">75 riyals</ENAMEX> per day .
If we multiply that by <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">30 days</ENAMEX> , it would be equivalent to the salary of a <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudi</ENAMEX> employee in a phone kiosk , maybe more .
You do the math .
It is notable that the demonstrations came just in time to ruin the holiday season in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Lebanon</ENAMEX> , especially in the area of central <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Beirut</ENAMEX> , known by the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Saudis</ENAMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Solidaire</ENAMEX> .
Investments in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Solidaire</ENAMEX> are by <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Christians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni Muslims</ENAMEX> .
There are no <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> investments , neither in tourism nor in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Solidaire</ENAMEX> .
Their investments are only in the mountain restaurants on the South .
Our Gulf brothers are afraid to eat in <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Shiite</ENAMEX> restaurants .
The timing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">July</ENAMEX> war came at the beginning of <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the tourist season</ENAMEX> .
Parking lots in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Solidaire</ENAMEX> turned into camps .
The time of demonstrations came in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">winter</ENAMEX> , so the demonstrators needed heat .
They could only find wood in the public parks , which were totally ruined .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Lebanese</ENAMEX> people gather in the evening around water - pipes , and a majority of them smoke hashish .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Syrians</ENAMEX> line up with carts selling bread and eggs .
Look at the female demonstrators from <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> .
They look like they are from an actress ' agency .
Imagine how the mercenary hashish - smoking demonstrators might bring down the government .
I will return , God willing , with the latest field reports , the subject is not political .
