Plain sentence:

    Somebody posted this, for instance, related to the recent threads here about & quot ; sieh & quot ; in the monument
    inscription : & quot ; Note the word & quot ; SIEH & quot ; : most people glide by this and simply say & quot ; sith &
    quot ; or & quot ; since & quot ;-but that is plainly not the word used, and it is difficult to believe it is a mistake.
