Plain sentence:
---------------
    It passes over fallen logs with long, noiseless leaps ; it creeps serpent-like beneath the wreck left by a summer
    cyclone ; it crosses the barren reaches of oak openings, where the shadows cast by huge pines adjacent mingle in
    fantastic figures ; it casts a shifting shadow itself as it sweeps across some lighter spot, where faint moonbeams find
    their way to the ground through overhanging branches.
