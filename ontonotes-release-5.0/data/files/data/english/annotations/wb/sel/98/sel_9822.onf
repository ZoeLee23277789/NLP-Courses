Plain sentence:
---------------
    I used to use TI Bebop 11s on my Borys archtop and I did n't have any problem setting up the intonation, but since I
    switched to TI Swing flatwound 10s, to get around on the fretboard better, I have to slant my bridge like crazy, and it
    still is n't that great intonation-wise.
