Plain sentence:
---------------
    On the other hand, if I put a negative charge on the cats-LRB-lets call them electrons now-RRB-and herd them to the
    right, then the current is flowing to the left, because that is the direction of increasing positive charge, or
    decreasing negative charge if you prefer.
