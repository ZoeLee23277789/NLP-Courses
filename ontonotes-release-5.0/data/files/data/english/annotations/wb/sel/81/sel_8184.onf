Plain sentence:

    In OTL Malthus predated Darwin by quite a long time, and in OTL, Darwin and many of the early formulators of the idea of
    natural selection tended to credit Malthus as being an early originator of the idea of selection of
    a-LRB-human-RRB-population, which they then later applied to animals, as a possible way in which species might be
    modified over a long period of time.
