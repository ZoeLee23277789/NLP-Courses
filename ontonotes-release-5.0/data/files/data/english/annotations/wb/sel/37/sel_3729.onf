Plain sentence:
---------------
    In mine, we know Sanchez got caught, so that did n't have to be shown, we know Felix is getting married, so the process
    of having to get to the church did n't have to be shown, the scene when Sanchez intrudes on the girl and her lover
    seemed kind of pointless in the PCS, yet in following the theme song in mine, it really gets the movie and his threat
    going.
