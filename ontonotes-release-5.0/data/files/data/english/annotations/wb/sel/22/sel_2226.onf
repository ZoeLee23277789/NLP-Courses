Plain sentence:
---------------
    I'm not much of a grammarian, so I 'd appreciate it if anyone wishes to step in here and give me some help, but from
    what I 've seen there seems to be two possibilities : 1-RRB-There was a variation in understanding as to what kinds of
    nouns constituted " proper nouns " ; or 2-RRB-Some people just capitalized all nouns, despite what old Ben thought about
    it.
