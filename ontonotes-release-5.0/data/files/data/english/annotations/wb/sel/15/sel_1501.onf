Plain sentence:
---------------
    And the lamp does n't even have to be designed for higher temperature-just reduce the power input to compensate for the
    trapped energy.

Treebanked sentence:
--------------------
    And the lamp does n't even have *-1 to be designed *-2 for higher temperature - *PRO* just reduce the power input
    *PRO*-3 to compensate for the trapped energy .
