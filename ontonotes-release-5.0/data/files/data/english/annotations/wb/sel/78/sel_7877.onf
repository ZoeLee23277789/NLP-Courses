Plain sentence:
---------------
    While I do n't agree that Dickens endorses a non-Stratfordian view-LRB-as some think-RRB-, I do think the passage
    indicates an uncertainty in his mind, as if the given information does not come together clearly or cogently or
    sufficiently, and rather than plumb that question, he is happy to leave it & quot ; a fine mystery. & quot ;
