Plain sentence:
---------------
    BTW, though I do n't believe a small engine such as ours could practically boil much water--that last degree to flash to
    steam is a killer--it seems a good idea to distill water drawn from the hot water tank, gaining a good bit of the
    required BTUs for free.
