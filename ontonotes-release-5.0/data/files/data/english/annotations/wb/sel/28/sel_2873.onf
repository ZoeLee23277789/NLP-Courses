Plain sentence:
---------------
    Movies and novels are both about story, and try to sweep you along in their worlds, but they 're immersive in different
    ways : a movie renders you totally passive because it fully engages two senses, sight and sound, while a novel invites
    you to participate, because it engages no senses, only the mind.
