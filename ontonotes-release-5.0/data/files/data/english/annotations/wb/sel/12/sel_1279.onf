    When I was in Germany under President Gerald Ford, I was registered as an informant of CID, and as I watched the Soviet
    Agents pick their targets among our Troops, trying to find men that were weak in character, so that they could control
    and influence them to do their dirty works, it became evident that they targeted mostly those that had Drug or Alcohol
    problems.
