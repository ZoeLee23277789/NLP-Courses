    It seemed to be working out okay for the guys I 've seen doing it, but I would think it would n't hurt to add a little "
    insurance " by mounting a couple of big eye bolts to the wall as well, and using a rachet strap to cinch the lathe
    against the work so it ca n't slide and let your long spindle fly out at you.
