Plain sentence:
---------------
    If the diagonal edge is your binding edge-I would consider using the straight grain of the fabric to make the binding
    strips rather than the cross-grain-this would help to stabilize the quilt edges also-you could mark off the diagonal
    measurement of the blocks on your binding strip-pin in place at each corner of the diagonal-then ease the diagonal to
    fit the binding strip and sew it down as you go.

    If the diagonal edge is your binding edge - I would consider *PRO* using the straight grain of the fabric *PRO*-1 to
    make the binding strips rather than the cross-grain - this would help *PRO* to stabilize the quilt edges also - you
    could mark off the diagonal measurement of the blocks on your binding strip - pin in place at each corner of the
    diagonal - then ease the diagonal *PRO*-2 to fit the binding strip and sew it down as you go .
