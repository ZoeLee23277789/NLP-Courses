    Interestingly enough, I already had a diagnostic test run by a local service center before going to the dealer and they
    were able to tell me within an hour that the PCM was the problem, but they were unable to fix the problem so I had it
    towed to the dealership-LRB-I did n't inquire as to why I just took the guy at his word that he could n't do the
    repair-RRB-.
