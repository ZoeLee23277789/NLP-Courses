Plain sentence:
---------------
    He also cleaned up all of the sliding-tubing connections between the radiators and phasing coils, roughened them up a
    bit, gooped them with a conductive anti-oxidant compound, re-fit and re-tuned them, then drilled through the tubing and
    riveted them together, and then used heat-shrink tubing over all of the phasing-coil connections.
