Plain sentence:

    Modern ones with electronic ballasts work fine, I have them in exposed outdoor porchlights and while they took a bit
    longer to reach full brightness, I had no problems using them down to 16 F which is the coldest I 've ever seen it get
    here, CA is quite a bit warmer, rarely even hitting freezing.
