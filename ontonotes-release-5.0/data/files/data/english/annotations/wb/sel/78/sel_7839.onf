    I know right before it happens, before it comes out of my bagonia, and I go into the bathroom, and pull down my shorts
    and undies, and wipe up intimately with two sections of Charmin Ultra, and there is a faint film of less than a drop,
    and then I plop down on the toilet and shove in a Playtex deoderant superplus tampon that comes in the pink box, and
