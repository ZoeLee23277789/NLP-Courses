Plain sentence:
---------------
    If you block the aisle in the grocery store because you 're blabbing with someone you have n't seen in ages and you use
    said aisle as your gathering place thereby blocking me from getting past the cake mixes and onto the marinara sauce, I
    will ask you to move nicely the first time and if you do n't pay attention, I will ram you with my cart and smile
    sweetly as I'm doing so.
