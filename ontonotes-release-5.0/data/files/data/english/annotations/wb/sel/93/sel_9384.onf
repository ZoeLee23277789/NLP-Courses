Plain sentence:
---------------
    From what I remember, the randart code seeded the randomised artifacts from & quot ; scores & quot ; of the original
    artifacts, but there was a rounding down process each time it happened, and the subsequent seedings were based on the
    new scoreset each time, instead of the original.
