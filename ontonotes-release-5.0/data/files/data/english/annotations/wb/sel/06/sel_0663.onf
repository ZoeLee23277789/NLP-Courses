Plain sentence:
---------------
    Because of cultural and language barriers, the calls last longer and drive a higher volume of repeat calls, both of
    which add cost to the business-while the cost per minute is cheaper offshore, the cost per call when additional
    second-tier support is factored in to handle the additional escalation volume is actually on par with many onshore call
    center options.
