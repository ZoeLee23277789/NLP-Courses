Plain sentence:

    From the book : ' if we come to the conclusion that the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally based on a
    conceptual illusion, it would be just as logical to admit the same possibility for the other physical laws, in which
    case the theory of the reversibility of the universe would almost carry with it its own retaliation, since the
    reversible physical laws are the foundation of that theory.
