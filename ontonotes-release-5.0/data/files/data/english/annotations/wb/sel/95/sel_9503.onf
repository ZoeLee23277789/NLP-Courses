Plain sentence:
---------------
    But I guess I 've always been the type to think in terms of curved paths, aesthetically pleasing asymmetries, one part
    raised a bit higher than the next, etc. I guess what I'm saying is that if you 've dealt with the obvious things, like
    slope if any and what would shade what, I'm not thinking of a lot of considerations other than aesthetics in terms of
    making the decision.
