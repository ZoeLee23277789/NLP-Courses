Plain sentence:
---------------
    I did n't have any thoughts about being able to fortify a block or something, but that is a good idea, maybe they could
    do that if they are terrified of the attacker, or if this attacker is much more powerful It was something I had thought
    of for a combat system I 'd never actually put into a game.
