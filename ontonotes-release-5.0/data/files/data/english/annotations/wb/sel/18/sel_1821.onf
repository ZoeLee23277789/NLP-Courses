    The system is very intelligently designed from an engineering standpoint the bearings can not be inadvertently
    preloaded, but the advent of high-quality hybrid ceramic bearings only serve to emphasize the excessive levels of drag
    that exist in the system as it currently stands and we can only hope that an upgrade is pending.
