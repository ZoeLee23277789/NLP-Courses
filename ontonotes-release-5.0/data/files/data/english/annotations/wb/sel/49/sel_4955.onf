Plain sentence:
---------------
    At first I was willing to give him no feedback but still wanted positive feedback from him-LRB-since I'm in the 20 to 30
    purchase range, with no sales by me-RRB-, but the more I think about it, the more I think the reason his positive
    percentage is so high is that he extorts positive ratings, or at least suppresses negative ones.
