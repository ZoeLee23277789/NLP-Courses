    What you have right now is partisanship on Capitol Hill that quite often boils down to insults, insinuations,
    inquisitions and investigations rather than pursuing the normal business of trying to pass major pieces of legislation,
    such as appropriations bills, and to try to work in such a way as to demonstrate to the American people that Congress
    and the White House can work together.
