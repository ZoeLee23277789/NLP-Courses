Plain sentence:
---------------
    I do n't think you need to worry about excluding air-the surface above the sponge or whatever is full of CO2 from the
    yeast, so very little oxygen is going to diffuse into the sponge, especially if you have it covered, and this will keep
    it from drying out, too.
