Plain sentence:
---------------
    Bob Kolker John, While at this point in the NG's existence, when there is a decline in SHWI activity, it does pain me to
    cite the charter in order to shoot down anyone's post, I do have to say that the TL you posit about American fundie
    Christians moving to Israel with the result of Israel being Christianized is future history and thus OT for SHWI.
