Plain sentence:
---------------
    Nothing else interchanged till later in the war, the hybrid Mk.IIIIV was done, that tried to combine the best of the
    two, but this should have been done in 1936, not 1942 A Standardized Mk IIIIV would really have done 90 % of the Nazis
    Tank needs for the entire war, much like the Sherman ATL Barbarossa has its own problems.
