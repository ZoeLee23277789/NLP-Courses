Plain sentence:
---------------
    When RM close a PO, they are obliged to pay compensation, and, possibly worse, face huge storms of public protest,
    commons debates etc. However, if RM can organise things such that the sub postmaster just can not afford to continue the
    business, and closes the PO, then RM can look all innocent, and exclaim that it was not their decision, and is nothing
    to do with them.
