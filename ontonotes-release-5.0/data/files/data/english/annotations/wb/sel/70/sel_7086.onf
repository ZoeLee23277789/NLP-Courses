Plain sentence:

    My suspicion is that what they did was this : 1-build the new midships in the dock 2-float it out of the dock and moor
    it 3-pull the T-2 tanker into the dock and cut off the bow and stern 4-pull the old midships out of the dock 5-push the
    new midships back into the dock 6-reconnect the bow and stern My only question is how they moved the bow out of the way.
