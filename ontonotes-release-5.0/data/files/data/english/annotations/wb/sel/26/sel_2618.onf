Plain sentence:
---------------
    A well-pipelined remainder operation could potentially pump out one remainder per clock cycle--which could turn out to
    be faster than processing the conditional test to reject those values in the upper range.

Treebanked sentence:
--------------------
    A well - pipelined remainder operation could potentially pump out one remainder per clock cycle -- which *T*-1 could
    turn out *-2 to be faster than *PRO* processing the conditional test *PRO* to reject those values in the upper range .
