    I think that if our Earthquake Administration had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this
    Longmenshan mountain earthquake belt, then on that day of May 12, once the Earthquake Administration had measured the
    quake at a magnitude of 7.8, we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the
    earthquake disaster zone.
