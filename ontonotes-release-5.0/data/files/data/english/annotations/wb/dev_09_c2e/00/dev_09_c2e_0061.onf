    Therefore, in the past few years, the corruption in the education sector that common people have strongly lashed out
    against includes precisely the lack of openness and transparency concerning school building construction, which has led
    to the non-existence of rules and regulations for project management and the sloppy enforcement of quality inspection,
    leaving behind large numbers of hazards for potential accidents.
