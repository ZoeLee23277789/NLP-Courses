Plain sentence:
---------------
    Marx strictly demarcated the boundary between scientific socialism and bourgeois humanitarianism, mercilessly discarding
    the humanitarianism of the capitalist class. Shrewdly noting that after scientific socialism had taken root, the key
    weakness of humanitarianism =bewitchment was in denying revolution, supplanting scientific socialism. While the Southern
    Weekend used the Wenchuan Earthquake as a pretext, dramatizing the horror and tragedy of the earthquake, to take the
    opportunity to beat the drum for bourgeois humanitarianism, saying, " The sound of the alarm was a wimpering, sobbing,
    but even more a call, calling for us to realize human dignity again, calling for us to realize value of life again. " As
    if our socialist New China has never placed importance on the " value of life ", and therefore needs this earthquake to
    " call for " us to " realize human dignity again " and " realize value of life again " !
