Who to Look into the Backroom Deals Behind the Privatization of State - owned <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shandong Luneng Group</ENAMEX> ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yun Dan Shui Nuan</ENAMEX>
As <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">the year 2006</ENAMEX> ended , so did a big hush - hush " deal . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Caijing Magazine</ENAMEX> described it as " a quiet change of ownership for this vast business empire . "
These were the final few steps as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shandong Luneng Group</ENAMEX> " completed " its privatization .
In the past , when I heard the big name of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group</ENAMEX> , I usually would link it with soccer .
I could never expect it is a <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">73.805 billion yuan</ENAMEX> giant .
Yet , in the privatization of this giant , it turns out that the fairy tale of " big returns on a tiny outlay " once again played itself out .
It was incredible that the fairy tale once again played itself out as the former senior managers of a state - owned company changed in the blink of an eye into the " bosses " of a " private " company .
Given these fairy tales , we should ask what backroom deals there were behind this .
Behind a fairy tale there must be backroom deals .
This is now almost an undisputed truth .
There 's never been a money fairy or goddess of wealth who gives wealth to anyone without any reason .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zhang Rongkun</ENAMEX> , the main player in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shanghai</ENAMEX> social insurance case , with a " new " company that was just registered and claimed to have <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">500 million</ENAMEX> in capital , was nevertheless able to acquire the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">99.35 %</ENAMEX> stake in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shanghai Luqiao</ENAMEX> held by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shanghai Chengtou</ENAMEX> at a price of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.2 billion yuan</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gu Chujun</ENAMEX> , with a mere <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">900 million</ENAMEX> , " acquired " top - quality state - owned assets with a total asset value of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">13.6 billion</ENAMEX> .
The backroom deals behind have already been revealed , and have entered into legal procedures .
And the privatization process of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shandong Luneng</ENAMEX> is also bound up with " acquisition . "
And in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2006</ENAMEX> , the " final " total " cost " of this acquisition , according to a report in the magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Caijing</ENAMEX> , was <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">3.73 billion yuan</ENAMEX> .
It was described by some as " <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">3 billion</ENAMEX> buys up <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">76 billion</ENAMEX> . "
For the " buyers , " you could use the minute probability , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">zero</ENAMEX> probability such as winning the lottery or pie falling from the sky as an analogy .
This means backroom deals .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL">First</ENAMEX> , according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Caijing</ENAMEX> report , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng</ENAMEX> 's privatization process lasted <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">11 years</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">-LRB- 1995 - 2006 -RRB-</ENAMEX> .
From state controlling stake → employee stock ownership with state investment → <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">100 %</ENAMEX> state controlled → employee stock ownership → private ownership , it has gone through <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> stages .
Yet , in this process , the real inside story is little known .
" Sneak into the village ; do n't fire the guns . "
In particular , the final stage of privatization turned out to be " top secret . "
The magazine <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Caijing</ENAMEX> reports : " The names of the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> ' new owners ' of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng</ENAMEX> were once called ' the top secrets of top secrets ' among a very small circle inside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng</ENAMEX> .
Now it is exactly these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> mysterious companies , whose names are unknown , that have taken over absolute stock control over this financial conglomerate . "
Ordinary people would think that since it 's a well - known former state - owned company with huge assets that is connected with investment and operations in a large number of fields and connected with state - owned assets of enormous value , every step of its changes should be taken in the light of day , completed under the supervision of the relevant regulations , and inspected under the gaze of the public and the media .
If it 's all rule - abiding , reasonable and legal , then why fear exposure ? Why all in secret , hidden away , veiled ?
Only if you know you have done something dishonest , will you be so much afraid of people knowing and try to make it " the top secret of the top secrets . "
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL" E_OFF="2">Secondly</ENAMEX> , at the recently concluded plenary meeting of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Central Discipline Inspection Commission</ENAMEX> , they required and emphasized strict monitoring of corrupt practices in the financial sector by party members and leading cadres , particularly in the area of the transfer of state - owned assets .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group 's</ENAMEX> former chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gao XX</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group 's</ENAMEX> former director - general <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xu X</ENAMEX> , who have " already " changed into " private entrepreneurs , " " continue to serve their former posts " in the new " private company . "
So , did these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Party</ENAMEX> members -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gao XX</ENAMEX> previously held the positions of chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Linyi</ENAMEX> administrative office , deputy head of the electrical utility bureau , assistant to the head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong</ENAMEX> electricity bureau , and general manager and party secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shandong Luneng Stock Controlling Group</ENAMEX> . Having gone through all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng</ENAMEX> 's stock transfers , he is still currently the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group</ENAMEX> . <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Xu X</ENAMEX> has served as head of the electrical utility bureau of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Linyi</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong</ENAMEX> . In <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">about 2003</ENAMEX> he first entered the headquarters of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group</ENAMEX> as vice president assigned to manage property operations , after which he was very quickly promoted to the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group</ENAMEX> -RRB- , in the process of the series of mysterious stock deals at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group</ENAMEX> , carry out the unshirkable duties which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">party</ENAMEX> members should undertake regarding state - owned assets and the public interest in strict accordance with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">CPC</ENAMEX> Charter and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Party</ENAMEX> 's strict discipline ?
Did they seek private gains for a small group or for themselves ?
If it was all above board , they should submit a report to the party organization on the process of their transformation from the senior management cadres of a state - owned company into " private entrepreneurs " and even announce it to the public .
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL" E_OFF="2">Thirdly</ENAMEX> , according to a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</ENAMEX> audit report , when <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group</ENAMEX> was first established in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</ENAMEX> , it had <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">150 million yuan</ENAMEX> in registered capital , and operational assets of <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">2.6 billion yuan</ENAMEX> .
A more concrete image is " just <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> people and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> office " expanding at an unimaginable speed in just <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">11 short years</ENAMEX> into <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong</ENAMEX> 's <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">73.805 billion yuan</ENAMEX> giant , incorporating coal - fired power stations , mining , real estate , engineering and construction , finance and sports clubs .
In this process , where did <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group</ENAMEX> get its assets and opportunities for expansion ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng</ENAMEX> 's background and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng</ENAMEX> 's " birth " are inseparable from the state - owned monopoly of the electricity industry .
The electricity industry has huge assets and occupies a market position of natural monopoly .
During <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng</ENAMEX> 's rapid expansion , how much " blood " it actually extracted from state - owned assets seems to be a " cloudy issue . "
What 's the idea with scrambling to " complete " privatization before this issue is cleared up , handed over to the public and announced to the media ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL" E_OFF="2">Fourthly</ENAMEX> , it 's said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> private " companies " that finally " assumed ownership " of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Guoyuan Union Co.</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shouda Nengyuan Energy Co.</ENAMEX> -- according to descriptions in the media , these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companies can be called " low profile " and " mysterious . "
If it was an open and above - board " assumption of ownership , " then why the " mystery ? " Why the " low profile ? "
According to reports , the origins , backgrounds and sources of capital for these <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> companies are completely beyond comprehension .
Is it possible that by some kind of " buying from yourself " process they have embezzled state - owned assets ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORDINAL" E_OFF="2">Fifthly</ENAMEX> , the departments supervising state - owned assets and the electricity industry are <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SASAC</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">SERC</ENAMEX> , respectively .
But with <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Shandong</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group</ENAMEX> undergoing such enormous changes , they say they " do not know what 's going on . "
They say , " We have not yet received <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group 's</ENAMEX> application materials for the transfer of stocks . "
But what 's strange is that according to reports by journalists , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng Group 's</ENAMEX> business registration has in fact already " been adjusted . "
What 's more , " since <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">November 2006</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Shandong Provincial Administration of Industry and Commerce</ENAMEX> has not allowed requests to see or inquire about the files of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Luneng</ENAMEX> family of companies . "
What on earth does this mean ?
Is it the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Caijing</ENAMEX> reporter " making rumors , " or are the relevant departments neglecting their supervision ?
No matter how it is , now that the media have publicly reported on it , there ought to be some answer .
So , who exactly will look into these backroom deals that have been exposed by current reports ?
