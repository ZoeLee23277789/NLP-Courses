Many discoveries are made *-1 by chance .
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">Michael Zhou</COREF>
<COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> remember <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">my</COREF> first year studying at <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">Qinghua</COREF> , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> went to <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">my</COREF> first elective course called * *PRO*-1 " Inspirations in the History of Physics</COREF> . "
There were only ten or so of us who *T*-1 had chosen <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> that semester .
<COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">The teacher</COREF> was very erudite , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> lectures were very lively ; <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> summarized all of the recent and contemporary history of physics , and each time <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> was enthralled *-1 .
In all <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">my</COREF> five years at <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the university</COREF> , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> never had another course that interesting .
If <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> were *-1 to summarize <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">this course</COREF> , it would be : <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">the greatest discoveries in physics</COREF> all had <COREF ID="36" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own necessity and theoretical basis -LRB- for example , the development of mathematics -RRB- .
This theory can also be applied *-1 to cooking .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">One day</COREF> <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> wanted *PRO* to make green beans and <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">bean curd sheets</COREF> <COREF ID="52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- dried tofu in the Northeast -RRB-</COREF> .
Here <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">the dried tofu sold * in the stores</COREF> is all compressed , very tough .
So <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> normally steep <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in hot water , then take <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out and stir - fry <COREF ID="56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Because <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">that day</COREF> <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> needed *-1 to go out in the middle of it and buy some things , <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> set <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the timer</COREF> and told <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">my</COREF> wife</COREF> *PRO*-2 to turn off <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the heat</COREF> when it was done *-3 *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">My</COREF> wife</COREF> is very lazy , and when <COREF ID="69" TYPE="IDENT">the timer</COREF> sounded *T*-1 , <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> turned off <COREF ID="71" TYPE="IDENT">the heat</COREF> and left the pot *PRO*-2 sitting on the stove .
When <COREF ID="86" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Michael_Zhou">I</COREF> came back and looked *T*-1 , the dried tofu was white and soft , just like freshly made .
*PRO* Chalk another good one up to <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the wife</COREF> .
