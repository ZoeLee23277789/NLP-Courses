Plain sentence:
---------------
    After you put the candied melon on, you take down the image of the Kitchen God that was hung above the stove the
    previous year and burn it at the side of the stove ; then you wait until the 30th when you put up the spring couplets
    and hang a new Kitchen God in the original place, and you hang up a couplet with the first line saying " Ascend to
    Heaven and tell good things " and the second line reading " Return and bring good fortune, " and the horizontal saying
    is " Ruler of This Home. "
