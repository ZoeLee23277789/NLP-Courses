<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> is Capable of *PRO*-1 withstanding <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the Impacts Brought * to <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> by US Economic Recession</COREF> .
Following the recession in 2001 , <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">the US economy</COREF> has entered into " soft - landing " adjustment after five years of continuous expansion .
Some expect that in <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">2007</COREF> the US economic growth rate will drop to 1.9 - 2.5 percent , the interest rate will drop to 4 percent , and the US dollar will continue *-1 to depreciate .
Once <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">the US economy</COREF> is in recession , will impacts will it bring *T*-1 to <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> ?
And what measures will <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> take *T*-1 in response ?
These are questions worth *PRO* pondering upon *?* .
Pressure brought * to <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> by the US economic recession .
<COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">The United States</COREF> is the powerhouse of the world economy and the largest international market .
The USD$ 800 - billion *U* annual trade deficit indicates 0 global exports are heavily dependent on <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">The US</COREF> is <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> No. 2 trade partner , No. 1 export market , No. 6 import source , and No. 3 technology import source .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> total export value was USD $ 875 billion *ICH*-1 from January to November 2006 , of which 21 % *T*-2 was export to <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> .
Plus the portion re-exported * from Hong Kong , export to <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> accounted for over 35 percent of the total Chinese export value .
Export of Chinese shipping , low - end electronics , furniture , textiles and artware could all be affected *-1 should <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> experience economic recession .
In addition , other developing countries in <COREF ID="1__89" TYPE="IDENT">Asia</COREF> are major suppliers in <COREF ID="1__91" TYPE="IDENT">the supply chain centered * around <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="1__91" TYPE="IDENT">the supply chain</COREF> is driven *-1 by the US demand .
As a result , slowdown of <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">the US economy</COREF> represents a huge pressure for <COREF ID="1__89" TYPE="IDENT">the entire Asia</COREF> .
Some expect that <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> export growth rate will decrease from 23 percent to 15 percent in <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">2007</COREF> .
If the government sit by and watch , the Chinese economic growth rate will drop 3 - 4 percent .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> is fully capable of *PRO*-1 withstanding the impacts .
Regardless of the accuracy of various comments , <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> must be prepared *PRO*-1 to cope with <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the US economic recession</COREF> .
Although some predictions are a little sensational , <COREF ID="1__111" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="buabua">the author</COREF> believes 0 <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the US economic recession</COREF> this time will not be very severe , with less impacts on <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> than other countries .
By *PRO*-1 taking some proactive measures , the Chinese economy is fully capable of *PRO*-1 withstanding such impacts .
From the current situation , strong domestic investment within <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> has fully compensated the impact of the decrease in net export .
<COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">The appreciation of RMB</COREF> has not affected export either , and the decrease in volume due to higher prices is offset *-1 by increased prices .
Raw materials imported * take a large percentage in the costs of the Chinese exports .
<COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">The appreciation of RMB</COREF> could , in the first place , lower costs .
Additionally , in the long term , RMB slowly edging up can encourage firms *PRO*-1 to use advanced international technology and resources .
The government may support export , especially technological upgrade of exports , by such ways as *PRO* increasing export rebates , adopting quicker depreciation , removing the super-national treatment to foreign investments .
It *EXP*-2 can be expected *-1 that neither <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">the appreciation of RMB</COREF> nor the global economic recession will seriously impact Chinese export .
It *EXP*-1 would be exaggerating *PRO* to say 0 <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> is 70 percent dependent on foreign trade .
The statistics has underestimated <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> Gross National Product -LRB- GNP -RRB- , especially that of <COREF ID="2__67" TYPE="IDENT">the tertiary sector</COREF> .
*PRO* Converting to US dollar at the exchange rate has also underestimated <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- .
As more than half of <COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese foreign trade</COREF> is processing trade , it *EXP*-1 would be overestimating <COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="IDENT">the total foreign trade</COREF> *PRO* to count import and export repeatedly .
<COREF ID="1__111" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="buabua">The author</COREF> estimates that <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">our country</COREF> actually might be 40 percent dependent on foreign trade .
Therefore , there is no need *PRO* to magnify <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> dependence on export to the US .
Export - oriented economic growth of <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> should be cooled *-1 down , while the role of domestic demand and import should be promoted *-2 .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Our</COREF> economic growth relies primarily on <COREF ID="2__97" TYPE="IDENT">the domestic market</COREF> and should be increasingly dependent on <COREF ID="2__97" TYPE="IDENT">the domestic market</COREF> .
If factors such as the rapid development of <COREF ID="2__67" TYPE="IDENT">the tertiary sector</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">the appreciation of RMB</COREF> are taken *-1 into consideration , <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> dependence on foreign trade can be controlled *-2 at around 50 percent in the long run .
Long - term export of Chinese products at low prices will lead to " impoverished wealth growth , " and we should specially understand the " wealth " as domestic environmental resources .
Foreign - funded processing export consumes domestic electricity and water resources substantially .
The environmental costs in <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">our country</COREF> account for approximately 30 percent of product costs , but are not incorporated *-1 into product prices .
And this is the primary reason why Chinese products are cheap *T*-1 .
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="001">
It *EXP*-1 is imperative *PRO* to remove the environmental subsidies to domestic and foreign consumers , internalize external environmental costs of Chinese products as soon as possible , and increase the prices of most products , including exports , in order *PRO* to alleviate international trade frictions , reduce the pressure for RMB appreciation , and in particular change the prospect that the Chinese environmental resources will seriously deteriorate .
In addition , the Chinese population is huge and young , which *T*-1 enables <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese economy</COREF> to enjoy the " population dividends . "
However , the percentage of savings is astoundingly high , and according to the hypothesis of macroeconomic balance where savings equal investments *T*-1 , the huge investments have become the source of high - speed economic development .
However , *PRO* to depress the consumption rate to lower than 40 percent will certainly lead to overproduction , and cheap goods will in turn impact the international market .
If the US economic recession would indeed <COREF ID="1__36" TYPE="IDENT">affect</COREF> <COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> export , <COREF ID="1__36" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would not necessarily be a bad thing in the author 's view .
In a sense , domestic demand will not increase unless export decreases .
Over the last 20 years , the world has experienced many economic crashes , *PRO*-1 affecting countries or regions such as Russia , Arab , Latin America and East Asia .
<COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">The US</COREF> also suffered stock market crash in 2001 .
<COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> is the only one 0 *T*-1 to realize economic emergence for the largest population in the history .
Whenever there is an international economic recession *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> would actively expand domestic demand *PRO* to create market for different countries .
In fact , <COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> has long been a responsible big nation , *PRO*-1 playing a stabilizing role to the international society .
External pressure is an opportunity for internal restructuring .
Long - term high - speed growth in <COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> has led to significant wealth growth , as well as different kinds of disequilibriums , such as : too much savings and investments and insufficient consumptions ; heavy investment in infrastructure and manufacturing , and insufficient investment in national defense , science and technology , education , health , environment and national reserves ; wider income gap , regional gap and gap between urban and rural areas ; <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">the economy</COREF> has become dependent on the US market to some extent due to long - term export orientation and trade surplus to <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> ; and environmental resource outflow by way of exporting , so on and so forth .
By now , high - speed growth of <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">the Chinese economy</COREF> has entered the final acceleration period that *T*-1 will span over a decade .
Beginning 2007 , the economic aggregate is expected *-1 to increase sharply by 150 percent , *PRO* leading to the " historical disequilibrium development " predicted * by Soros .
This is also why <COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> is not afraid of <COREF ID="1__120" TYPE="IDENT">a global economic crisis</COREF> and capable of *PRO*-1 digesting <COREF ID="1__120" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-2 .
However , after 2020 , <COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> will be facing the puzzle of population aging , which *T*-1 is sure *PRO*-2 to witness an economic slowdown .
As an expectation , there will be leading overreactions in financial and real estate areas by around 2015 .
<COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> must complete a series of tasks *ICH*-1 in <COREF ID="2__9" TYPE="IDENT">this period</COREF> , including system restructuring , *PRO* overcoming the financial crisis , improving national defense strength , safeguarding national security , realizing technological upgrade and protecting the environment .
The economic growth in future will be realized *-1 primarily through technological advancement and social harmony .
Within <COREF ID="2__9" TYPE="IDENT">these years</COREF> , the sharply grown wealth of RMB? 40 trillion *U* shall be used *-1 effectively in areas including national defense , science and technology , environment , national soil renovation , and *PRO* adjusting social relations .
It *EXP*-1 wo n't do *PRO* to rely solely on the market mechanism and economic strength .
*PRO* To realize , there should also be a correct strategy , relying upon the comprehensive strength of the culture , <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> and the society .
Various disequilibriums in the rapid growth of <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> must be adjusted *-1 .
From this perspective , <COREF ID="2__46" TYPE="IDENT">the US economic recession</COREF> imposes external pressure on the economic restructuring , which *T*-1 is also an opportunity .
Whether the impacts brought * to <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> by <COREF ID="2__46" TYPE="IDENT">the US economic recession</COREF> can be resisted *-1 and the impacts on the world economy can be alleviated *-2 hinge on whether or not <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> can truly expand <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> domestic demand .
The next few years may see the Chinese economy cooling down , a continuous modest rise in RMB , a slowdown in the speed and volume of export growth , a possible decrease in trade surplus , and speculative capital and the real estate bubble in control , which *T*-1 are adjustments from disequilibriums to equilibriums in the economic relations between <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> and between <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> and the world , as well as in the social relations within <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> .
