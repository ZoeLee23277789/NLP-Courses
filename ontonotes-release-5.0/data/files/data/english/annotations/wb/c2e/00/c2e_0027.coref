<COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Topic</COREF> : <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Thoughts on Ethnic Conflict and <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the Policy of Consideration for Minorities</COREF></COREF>
<COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Posting station</COREF> : <COREF ID="1__27" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">BBS Unnamed space station</COREF></COREF> -LRB- Mon Jan 29 14:57:49 2007 -RRB- , at <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">the station</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">This article</COREF> was originally written *-1 in response to a Muslim Club question ; if <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> tone is excessive in spots , please *PRO* excuse .
What you said *T*-1 is right : many of these are individual clashes .
It *EXP*-1 is very difficult for one person 's ethnic or religious status to shape a person 's behavior .
If <COREF ID="1__47" TYPE="IDENT">one individual in an ethnic group or religion</COREF> does something bad , you can only say that <COREF ID="1__51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__47" TYPE="IDENT">that person 's</COREF> character</COREF> has an essentially evil side to <COREF ID="1__51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
If <COREF ID="1__47" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does good , then certainly a large part of <COREF ID="1__51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__47" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> character</COREF> is good .
If we reverse this logic , no religion or ethnic group in the world is without blame .
<COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">The Han</COREF> have a longer history than <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the Hui</COREF> and a greater population ; who *T*-1 knows how many clashes there *ICH*-3 have been *T*-2 historically with the peripheral minorities ?
So can we say that <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the Han</COREF> are such and such ?
With regard to certain clashes involving local ethnic groups or territories , it does n't say anything about whether that ethnic group is bad or good ; rather it 's a tragedy brought * on by a sort of " security crisis " and " misinterpreted information . "
Most of all , it 's basically a matter of the political system and of trust .
Regardless of whether it 's <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the Han</COREF> or <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the Hui</COREF> , when friction first crops up *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1__105" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lack of faith in the <COREF ID="1__unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">government</COREF> and law -LRB- this is a characteristic of many autarchies -RRB- makes <COREF ID="1__105" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> <COREF ID="1__unknown-E3" TYPE="IDENT">believe</COREF> that <COREF ID="1__unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> can not fairly and effectively handle the situation .
<COREF ID="1__unknown-E3" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> gives <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT">both sides</COREF> the illusion 0 <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're in a state of anarchy .
More often than not <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> resort to *PRO*-1 using the strength of <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own villages or ethnic group *PRO*-2 to protect <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> security .
This " civic conflict " gets turned *-1 into an " ethnic conflict . "
And when <COREF ID="1__120" TYPE="IDENT">one side</COREF> mobilizes <COREF ID="1__120" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own village *PRO*-3 to respond to the security threat -LRB- not just physical safety but also moral safety - *PRO* protecting <COREF ID="1__120" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> own way of life -RRB- that <COREF ID="1__120" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> see *T*-1 as *PRO*-2 coming from another village *T*-4 , the other side obviously will not stand idly by but will also mobilize and prepare .
In this way the impressions of <COREF ID="1__120" TYPE="IDENT">the first group</COREF> will be validated *-1 , and so on , with <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT">both sides</COREF> falling into the vicious cycle of " security crisis " just as when a war breaks out in international politics *T*-2 ; the clash is unavoidable .
*PRO* Add to this the fact that <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT">both sides</COREF> include <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">some people who , *T*-1 because <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have been regularly bullied *-2 , or <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the village headman or sheikh</COREF> wants *PRO*-3 to use this as an opportunity *PRO* to gain some political advantage and increase <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own influence , *PRO*-3 seizing the chance *PRO* to fan the flames and inciting people *PRO*-5 to fight</COREF> .
Some governments -LRB- the Manchu Qing -RRB- even adopted a policy of " *PRO* using the barbarians *PRO* to control the barbarians , " stirring up conflict , using <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the Hui</COREF> *PRO* to control <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the Han</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the Han</COREF> *PRO* to control <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the Hui</COREF> .
There are <COREF ID="2__27" TYPE="IDENT">some people who *T*-1 make an uproar over <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">Hui</COREF> - <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">Han</COREF> clashes who *T*-2 take a one - sided view</COREF> ; <COREF ID="2__27" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> see only the clash , but <COREF ID="2__27" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> overlook how many times these types of clashes have been settled *-3 *T*-4 , how many times there has been cooperation between <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT">the two groups</COREF> *T*-5 .
Some people claim *PRO*-1 to be involved *-2 in academic research , then the first thing that *T*-3 should be done *-4 is *PRO* to list <COREF ID="2__43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">all the interactions between <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT">the two groups</COREF> in history and in the present</COREF> : <COREF ID="2__43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">clashes , peaceful coexistence , cooperation</COREF> .
In this way you get at least three variables , and only then can you analyze the causal relationship .
Some people 's resulting variables do not change , or there is <COREF ID="2__60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">only one value</COREF> : <COREF ID="2__60" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">clashes</COREF> .
What kind of " scientific research " result can people like this achieve *T*-1 ?
Changes in variables should also be considered *-1 in terms of consideration .
You look at the many policies of minority consideration , but you should also look at how , in a majority - <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">Han</COREF> society , in a society that *T*-1 stresses uniformity and looks down on individuality , there are just as many mechanisms and opportunities for discrimination against minorities , if not more *T*-2 .
Did you know that in interviews <COREF ID="2__84" TYPE="IDENT">some people</COREF> are rejected *-1 just because <COREF ID="2__84" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have a northwest accent ?
Do you know how distressed Muslims are *T*-1 in a unit or company where there is no halal canteen *T*-2 ?
Have you ever heard <COREF ID="2__93" TYPE="IDENT">a Mongol father</COREF> cry because <COREF ID="2__93" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son has *-1 to start *-2 studying Chinese in first grade ?
Do you understand how development of the West has plundered so many resources and left <COREF ID="2__102" TYPE="IDENT">the local minorities</COREF> *PRO*-1 just as needy as <COREF ID="2__102" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ever were *?* *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="2__104" TYPE="IDENT">This lack of consideration</COREF> is most often not obvious , but <COREF ID="2__104" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is everywhere .
Of course <COREF ID="2__108" TYPE="IDENT">these forms of discrimination</COREF> very seldom come from <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the whole " Han race " as an abstract</COREF> ; most often <COREF ID="2__108" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> come from <COREF ID="2__114" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the system</COREF> - <COREF ID="2__114" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">a form of ethnic rule that *T*-1 combines centralized authority + representatives of local minorities</COREF> .
It can not be denied *-1 ; minorities have many faults as well .
However , the vast majority of the people at <COREF ID="2__126" TYPE="IDENT">the lower levels of society</COREF> are blameless , just as the vast majority of our <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">Han</COREF> compatriots at <COREF ID="2__126" TYPE="IDENT">the lower levels of society</COREF> are blameless .
Those who *T*-1 should be blamed *-2 are <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the cadres in the upper echelons of the Party , the so - called ethnic cadres</COREF> and the influential capitalists in league with <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="001">
In the past when the local tyrants and despots among <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the minorities</COREF> were overthrown *-1 *T*-2 , <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the masses of minorities</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Han</COREF> were equally happy .
But today <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> find that the cadres and capitalists from <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">those years</COREF> are now standing together , and the <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">Han</COREF> people of the same class from <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">those years</COREF> are beginning *-1 to suppress <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Of course some people say that <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="IDENT">the Communist Party</COREF> and most <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">Han</COREF> cadres have made many contributions to the construction of border and minority areas , and have sacrificed so much .
Right , <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the minorities</COREF> should be grateful and remember the contributions of the <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">Han</COREF> cadres , and this proves that any two ethnic groups can live peacefully together .
However , it *EXP*-2 can also be said *-1 that <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="IDENT">the Party</COREF> and the country have a duty *PRO* to provide basic infrastructure and improve economic development ,
because since you govern this land , and you collect taxes , do you really want *PRO*-3 to wipe your ass and leave ?
More importantly , <COREF ID="1__44" TYPE="IDENT">the so - called " preferential policy "</COREF> can only be given *-1 by a powerful ethnic group or force .
This should be common knowledge - the people who *T*-1 can give are always higher - ups .
And <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the weaker ethnic groups</COREF> can only accept <COREF ID="1__44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> passively .
But *PRO* let 's not mention on what basis <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="IDENT">the Communist Party</COREF> divided 55 ethnic groups into " minorities " *T*-1 !!??
The essence of <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="IDENT">our Party 's</COREF> ethnic preferential policies is *PRO* to permanently institute this strong - weak relationship between <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Han race</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> fraternal ethnic groups</COREF> -LRB- the relationship between the center and the fringe , the governing and the governed .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Han race -LRB- *PRO* mainly meaning the inner bureaucracy -RRB-</COREF> act like the emperor , *PRO*-1 doling out to <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the " minority "</COREF> here and there .
And <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the " minorities "</COREF> can only feel deeply grateful , how will <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> dare *PRO*-1 discuss equality *T*-2 !!
People who *T*-1 are given *-2 consideration are in mainstream eyes the weak ; as time goes by , <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the " minorities " who *T*-3 are given *-4 consideration</COREF> also get accustomed to this arrangement and believe that <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are the weak ones and should be dominated *-5 , as if <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were inferior !!!!
Do n't you see it ,
but whenever there is some event like National Day or May First *T*-1 , all the ethnic groups get together in Tiananmen Square , and <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> dress as " minorities , " wear <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> costumes , <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> traditional folk dress</COREF> , even if <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have never worn <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT">such outfits</COREF> in <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> daily lives .
While the <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">Han</COREF> leaders and representatives are wearing Western suits and leather shoes .
What does <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> explain *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> perfectly reflects this strong - weak relationship : <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Han</COREF> are contemporary , and <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the minorities</COREF> are backward , stuck in the past and abnormal !!!!
This is the price 0 *PRO* to pay *T*-1 for *PRO*-2 being considered *-3 !!!
What need *ICH*-1 is even there *PRO* to talk of abuse *T*-2 !!??
All ethnic groups have been enslaved *-1 .
What else is there *T*-1 ?
The result of *PRO* receiving consideration is the degeneration of these ethnic groups , with no hope of progress .
Do n't we really know where <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">those people</COREF> got <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> sour grapes *T*-1 ?
