<COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">An Intellectual who *T*-1 was a Lifelong Leading Official until Death</COREF> -- A Few Disrespectful Words about <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba</COREF>
<COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">613305</COREF>
-LSB- Ghost turning the mill -RSB-
<COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">The lifelong term system of leading cadres</COREF> is not good , and <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has long been criticized *-1 by intellectuals .
The so - called idea about <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">the lifelong term system of <COREF ID="1__16" TYPE="IDENT">leading cadres</COREF></COREF> means 0 when the end of a term of office comes *T*-1 , or when a given age is reached *-2 *T*-3 , <COREF ID="1__16" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should step down .
This point has already been put *-1 into practice , though *PRO* not fully implemented *-2 in reality .
Some very bad practices *ICH*-2 have n't been abolished *-1 yet : i.e. <COREF ID="1__30" TYPE="IDENT">the lifelong remuneration system for leading cadres</COREF> .
What *T*-1 is known *-2 as <COREF ID="1__30" TYPE="IDENT">the lifelong remuneration system for leading cadres</COREF> means that when <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">a leading cadre</COREF> steps down from <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> senior position *T*-3 , <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> still retains <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> level of remuneration such as " division leader level . "
Even worse is *T*-1 that as soon as you become a leading cadre , you are then a leader for life , with no need *PRO* to worry about any problems of *PRO* being laid *-2 off .
If your department disappears , it does n't matter , either .
A sinecure *ICH*-2 can always be arranged *-1 for you at a salary high enough for you to maintain your integrity , like *PRO* going to the CPPCC *PRO*-3 to serve as some deputy chairperson .
If you do n't break the law , you will only move upwards , you wo n't slip downwards .
<COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> think 0 we should completely abolish <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">the life - long term system of leading cadres</COREF> .
For example , if <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">a person</COREF> is mayor , when <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> steps down at the end of <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> term *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> could no longer be given *-2 mayor level remuneration .
If <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is not able enough and becomes a division leader , then <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> should be remunerated *-1 at the division leader level .
If <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's even more incompetent and has been laid *-1 off , then <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> should be like a laid - off factory worker and collect unemployment benefits .
<COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> should n't go to the mayor , but to the markets .
The " iron rice bowl " was broken *-1 for workers decades ago .
There is no reason why leading cadres should still be holding onto a golden rice bowl *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> 've had a look at <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba 's</COREF> biography and was surprised *PRO*-1 to find that <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba</COREF> had been chairman of <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Writers ' Association</COREF> since 1983 right up until <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> passed away .
<COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Writers ' Association</COREF> is n't any kind of important department affecting the national economy and people 's livelihood and whether <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was *?* <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">the lifelong term system</COREF> would draw nobody 's attention .
But <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba</COREF> , as an intellectual who *T*-1 always spoke the truth and stood up for what *T*-2 was right , should have known that <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">the lifelong term system of leaders</COREF> is not good , and should have been opposed *-3 .
Moreover , when <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba</COREF> became chairman of <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Writers ' Association</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was already quite elderly .
*PRO*-2 Doing it for one or two terms , <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'd be +really senile however you look at it *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own health problems .
How could <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> have that much energy *PRO*-1 to manage the affairs of <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Writers ' Association</COREF> *T*-2 ?
It *EXP*-1 would have been better *PRO* to get off the pot .
In fact , in <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> last days , <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba</COREF> lay in the hospital , *PRO*-1 unable *PRO*-2 even to speak , *PRO*-1 completely reliant on medical intervention *PRO* to keep <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-3 alive .
Even if <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to manage , <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would have been unable *PRO*-2 to *?* .
<COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">" Harvest " magazine</COREF> was created *-1 by <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba</COREF> single - handedly , and <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was always <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> chief editor .
Even if later on it was <COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba Junior</COREF> who *T*-1 took over <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">the work</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> still carried <COREF ID="2__67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba 's</COREF> name</COREF> .
After <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba</COREF> passed away , <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">the magazine</COREF> still wrote that <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was the chief editor .
In the end someone got really mad and filed a legislative complaint .
But this affair had no further development afterwards .
<COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> guess 0 the biggest reason maybe is 0 because of <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba 's</COREF> great influence , everyone settled out of court ; both sides gave a little ground , and <COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba Junior</COREF> no longer used <COREF ID="2__67" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba Senior 's</COREF> name</COREF> in *PRO* doing advertisements for <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">the magazine</COREF> .
*PRO* To say a little more : right now <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">all the intellectuals</COREF> are all heaping praise on <COREF ID="2__94" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba 's</COREF> " Random Thoughts</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> think 0 <COREF ID="2__94" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> " speaks the truth , " " stands up for what *T*-1 's right . "
However , what <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> like *T*-1 is <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba 's</COREF> " Torrents " trilogy and " Cold Nights . "
<COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba</COREF> had written the works that *T*-1 made <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> name , and are <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> greatest works , before <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was thirty .
<COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> believe that what <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said *T*-1 at that time was very honest .
<COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was using <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> heart and blood in <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> writing .
If you read the afterwords 0 <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's written *T*-1 you 'll know .
<COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> says 0 <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was often crying as <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was writing .
<COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> 've also seen that <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">Director Ba</COREF> was +under the deep influence of extreme leftism at that time and said many good things about the totalitarian society .
