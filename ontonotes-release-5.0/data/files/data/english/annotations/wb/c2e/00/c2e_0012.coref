*PRO* Setting up an <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> business : What do you need *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="1__118" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">usana - msi</COREF>
*PRO* Setting up an <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> business : What do you need *T*-1 ?
Experience in *PRO* setting up a business : <COREF ID="1__118" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">My</COREF> " boss " dream
Three stages of *PRO* setting up a business from scratch
The critical path of success
*PRO* Talking about *PRO* setting up a business
Now , as <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> grows , the <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> economy has passed through a " bubble era " and is gradually moving toward a dazzling springtime .
When you look at the IT giants that *T*-2 have sprouted up one after the other on <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> *T*-1 , do you get excited ?
Are you worried ?
Are you determined ?
*PRO* Setting up an <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> business is an idea that *T*-1 appeals to people .
Because : 1. Low cost
Unless <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are undertaking a very large project , <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">Internet entrepreneurs</COREF> do not need much capital .
<COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="IDENT">Perhaps one computer + ADSL + a dummy mainframe + a small room</COREF> and you can get started .
But <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is still far , far from success .
Some people may scoff that <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> ca n't be called *-1 *PRO*-2 *PRO* setting up a business .
If you have plenty of funds , very sharp thinking , and a classic idea , you do n't need *-1 to read what <COREF ID="1__118" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">I</COREF> wrote *T*-2 .
But *PRO* do n't stick up your nose ; for the time being we 're not talking about the relationship between capital and profit .
You feel that if the cost is insignificant , the profit must not be worth *PRO* mentioning .
Well , now <COREF ID="1__118" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">I</COREF> 'm telling you 0 you're 're wrong .
This traditional cost - profit relationship just does n't work on <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> .
Because you 've overlooked <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">one thing</COREF> , and <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's your own intelligence and ability .
In *PRO* setting up an <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> business , <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> holds a more important position .
<COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">The Internet</COREF> is absolutely a place for the daring to be forceful .
If you have the ability , you can hope *PRO*-1 to succeed .
2. Low start - up cost
<COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> communications are now well developed .
It *EXP*-2 can be said *-1 that all 0 you need *T*-3 is broadband , and you 've solved most of your <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> communication problems and can save yourself a lot of telephone charges .
At the same time , you do n't need *-1 to go out and rent a storefront and pay exorbitant rents .
Early on , before you 've formally registered the company , you also do n't have *-1 to be bothered *-2 with lots of petty charges and taxes .
3. Staffing is very simple ; in the early stages many entrepreneurs start from scratch , with one person handling all tasks .
Because one person can basically cope with everything in the early stages , there is no need *PRO* to incur personnel costs .
4. The risk is low , so if the business fails , you do n't need *-1 to be afraid .
Because the initial investment is low , there are greater opportunities for turnover .
Therefore the entrepreneur can give up without *PRO*-1 fearing the consequences of failure .
5. High profit
If you succeed early on in *PRO*-1 setting up your business and continue on down the right path of development , then <COREF ID="1__118" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">I</COREF> congratulate you .
Now you can shout it out : " My Web site is making a profit ! "
But *PRO* do n't let the first bucket of money 0 you make *T*-1 go to your head .
*PRO* Do n't forget , 0 the higher you climb , the higher you 'll fall .
*PRO* Remind yourself that now is *T*-1 the time 0 you need *-2 to keep a close watch on developments in market trends and among your competitors *T*-3 .
*PRO* Promptly adjust your growth strategy .
Only then will you be smiling at the end .
Maybe when you read about the advantages of *PRO* establishing an <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> business above *T*-1 , your heart was racing and you were thinking 0 you 'd really work hard *PRO*-2 to make it .
Below <COREF ID="1__118" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">I</COREF> 'm going *-1 to discuss some of the areas that you need *-2 to pay attention to *T*-3 when *PRO* setting up an <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> business *T*-4 :
1. *PRO* Use your own unique vision *PRO*-1 to examine <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> and look for new ways 0 *PRO* to make a profit *T*-2 .
*PRO* Aggressively investigate new projects ; *PRO* avoid *PRO*-1 blindly imitating others .
Are there lots of people doing this kind of thing on <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> ?
If a flashA.com appears on <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Net</COREF> today , tomorrow there will be flashC.com and flashD.com .
If that 's the case , your odds of failing just increased by 30 % .
*PRO* Remember : If you 're always following on somebody else 's tail , then what you'll get *T*-1 will always be someone else 's trash , picked * over , cast * aside and unused .
Of course we 're not opposed to imitating , but what we should think about *T*-1 is why is <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">this person</COREF> taking that route *T*-2 , and not which route is <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">this person</COREF> taking *T*-3 .
Then we will study the line of thought and the skills 0 <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> used *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to solve problems .
So we will gain more than <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> did .

2. If you 've selected <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">a given project</COREF> and are carrying <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out , then you should definitely carry <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> through to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the end</COREF> ; *PRO* avoid *PRO*-1 switching course in midstream .
Of course when <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">I</COREF> say *PRO* <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">see</COREF> <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> through to <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">the end</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="13" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> does not mean *PRO* to continue blindly , *PRO* sticking with <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> even when you know full well 0 <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's hopeless *T*-2 .
What <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">I</COREF> mean *T*-1 is , *PRO* do n't be distracted *-2 , *PRO* doing SMS today and selling things tomorrow , with a new approach every day .
You see somebody else doing <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">something that *T*-1 makes money</COREF> , and you think 0 you want *PRO*-2 to do <COREF ID="26" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
Your website is simply the " art of *PRO* changing your look " like in Sichuan opera .
A new face every day , completely different .
What <COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">I</COREF> recommend *T*-1 is that when you set up <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">your business</COREF> *T*-2 you should give <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> careful consideration and fully investigate <COREF ID="41" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> feasibility .
Once you set out *PRO*-1 to do something , you should pursue <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">the goal 0 you set *T*-2 for yourself</COREF> , *PRO*-3 sticking with <COREF ID="51" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> unless *PRO* really forced *-4 *PRO*-5 to give up .
3. *PRO* Use your hands , eyes and brain , be observant and alert , and consider all possibilities .
*PRO* Avoid *PRO*-1 acting rashly when you set up your <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> business *T*-2 .
Your mind needs *-1 to be sharp ; <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">the Internet</COREF> offers virtually unlimited business opportunities ; maybe <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's just a small opportunity , but you should seize <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Then maybe you will succeed .
Otherwise if <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">the opportunity</COREF> was right in front of you and you did n't seize <COREF ID="70" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
So ... you need nimble hands .
If you come upon <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">something important</COREF> , *PRO* by all means make a note of <COREF ID="78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and so on .
Your eyes need *-1 to be sharp : you need *-2 to spot changes in the IT situation right away and quickly prepare a short - term business plan .
Like right now , <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">many portal sites</COREF> are seizing <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">the opportunity of the Olympics</COREF> *PRO*-1 to considerably increase <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> traffic .
<COREF ID="138" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="usana-msi">I</COREF> think 0 advertising revenues in <COREF ID="89" TYPE="IDENT">this area alone</COREF> will be considerable .
4. *PRO* Be tough and resilient : *PRO* avoid the easy route .
*PRO* Setting up an <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> business is hard labor .
When you 're just setting up your business *T*-1 , it *EXP*-2 is sometimes hard *PRO* to avoid *PRO*-3 feeling completely exhausted .
Sometimes you 'll just feel like *PRO*-1 throwing in the towel .
*PRO* Do n't forget : if you were <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">working</COREF> for someone else , you would n't like <COREF ID="109" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> either , and may feel even worse !
5. You need *-1 to learn *PRO*-2 to look for partners .
6. You need *-1 to know what <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">Internet</COREF> marketing</COREF> is *T*-2 , and learn how *PRO* to use <COREF ID="113" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-3 .
Are you looking for an already proven , feasible way 0 *PRO* to increase your sources of income *T*-1 ?
Are you looking for an opportunity *PRO* to create both free time and financial freedom ?
Do you have dreams or goals that you want *PRO*-1 to reach *T*-2 ?
