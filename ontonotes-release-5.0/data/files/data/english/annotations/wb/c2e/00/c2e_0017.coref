In Memory of <COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> : <COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> was Indeed <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong 's</COREF> Close Comrade - in - arms
-LSB- New Philosophy -RSB-
<COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> <COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">was</COREF> a loyal defender and implementer of <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> Thought .
<COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was sufficiently proved *-1 by the victory of the 4th Anti - " Encirclement " campaign , the victory of the Red Army 's 25000 - li Long March , the victory in the Anti-Japanese War , the victory in the War of Liberation , as well as socialist economic construction .
Some say that <COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> <COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="IDENT">followed</COREF> <COREF ID="2__76" TYPE="IDENT">the " doctrine of the mean</COREF> . "
<COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is not true .
<COREF ID="2__76" TYPE="IDENT">The " doctrine of the mean "</COREF> only mechanically implemented the " mathematical logic " theory for development and change in the material world .
In fact , <COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> best understood and mastered the " Concept on People " of <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> Thought , and best understood and mastered the concept of " The Development of Human Society " of <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> Thought that *T*-1 focuses on " events , not people " in *PRO* transforming human society .
In politics , <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to transform people 's ideology , rather than to destroy people .
<COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> dealt with those comrades in the Party who *T*-1 committed blunders by *PRO* " learning from past mistakes *PRO*-2 to avoid future errors , and curing the sickness *PRO*-2 to save the patient ; " <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> treated <COREF ID="2__109" TYPE="IDENT">KMT war prisoners</COREF> by *PRO*-3 transforming <COREF ID="2__109" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Ever since <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong 's</COREF> leadership position in the Red Army and Party Central Committee was established *-1 at the Zunyi Conference , <COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> had always been <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong 's</COREF> close assistant .
<COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> accurately understood and mastered <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> Thought .
<COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> protected many comrades and democratic personages from brutal attacks and persecutions during the Cultural Revolution .
<COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> %pw sincerely implemented diplomatic guidelines and the blueprint for *PRO* constructing the " Four Modernizations " proposed * by <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> .

<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> was approved of *-1 and supported *-1 by <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> and was loved *-1 by the general populace as well .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> gave <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> all until <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> heart ceased *-1 to beat .
<COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">Li Xiannian</COREF> once said : " We often say that we must serve the people with heart and soul .
What is heart and soul *T*-1 ?
In <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> opinion , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Comrade Enlai</COREF> is an example for us . "
Deng Xiaoping once said that during the Cultural Revolution , because of " the prestige of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Chairman Mao</COREF> , <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Premier Zhou</COREF> , and other older generation leaders , even though an ' all - out civil war ' was said *-1 to have occurred , real civil war did not occur , as in the end it was not a large - scale fight . "
" We will learn from <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> absolute loyalty to Marxism , Leninism , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> Thought . "
<COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> Thought was the most valuable spiritual wealth of the Chinese people .
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">Zhou Enlai</COREF> established an example for us through <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> accurate understanding and mastery of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> Thought , and implementation of <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">Mao Zedong</COREF> Thought .
