Is it *EXP*-1 Really Healthy *PRO* to Drink Milk on Empty Stomach ?
Healthy and happy
Protein will be wasted *-1 to *PRO* drinking milk on empty stomach ?
Some say 0 *PRO* drinking milk on empty stomach will consume the protein wastefully as energy ,
but actually milk contains about 45 % lactose , which *T*-1 is carbohydrate that *T*-2 will decompose first *PRO* to supply energy and save protein .
In addition , milk also contains about 3 % fat , which *T*-1 also plays the role of *PRO* supplying energy .
Therefore , *PRO* drinking milk on empty stomach will not lead to protein waste .
The fact that infants under the age of one can drink milk on empty stomach and absorb nutrients proves that milk contains a variety of nutrients that *T*-1 can be fully used *-2 by the human body .
Even if the digestion rate will be slightly lowered *-1 , it *EXP*-2 is healthier *ICH*-3 *PRO* to drink milk on empty stomach than *PRO* to eat nothing the whole morning when there is no time for breakfast *T*-4 .
Tip : *PRO* drink boiled water before milk .
It *EXP*-1 is not appropriate *PRO* to take milk as the only drink in the early morning .
When you get up in the morning *T*-1 , it *EXP*-2 's better *PRO* to drink a big glass of boiled water -LRB- light honey water is better in case of a dry indoor environment during the heating season -RRB- before *PRO* consuming milk .
As <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">milk</COREF> has higher osmotic pressure , <COREF ID="63" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is far less quick and effective compared to boiled water in terms of *PRO* supplying moisture .
Who can not *T*-1 drink milk on empty stomach ?
What *T*-1 needs our attention is that if there are abdominal distention or diarrhea after *PRO* drinking milk , it *EXP*-2 is then indeed inappropriate *PRO* to drink a lot of milk with on empty stomach .
It *EXP*-1 is better *PRO* to have some starchy food before you drink milk in multiple small serves , and it *EXP*-2 is better *PRO* to have yogurt .
Experts said 0 milk can not be consumed *-1 on empty stomach 20 years ago , because <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">Chinese</COREF> had few chances 0 *PRO* to drink milk *T*-2 .
Once <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were weaned *-1 from breast milk , <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> hardly saw any dairy products .
Long - term separation from dairy products led to " lactose intolerance " of the body .
<COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> suffered abdominal distention , diarrhea or dyspepsia whenever <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> drink milk *T*-1 .
If <COREF ID="104" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> drink too fast , especially *PRO* drinking milk on empty stomach , the symptom would exacerbate .
Now time is different , and the diet pattern has also changed .
<COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">Many children and young people</COREF> often consume milk , yogurt , ice cream and even cheese since childhood , which *T*-1 bring <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> strong ability *PRO* to digest milk lactose .
Even if <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> drink milk on empty stomach , <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will not feel uncomfortable .
So , the so - called remark of " no milk on an empty stomach " should be changed *-1 , at least with a premise added *-2 , instead of *PRO* being generalized *-3 .
