Do CPA's in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> Make a Good Living ?
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="chaoxing">I</COREF> used *-1 to work for an accounting firm in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> .
It 's not a big city , but <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="chaoxing">I</COREF> always <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">thought</COREF> 0 the job 0 <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="chaoxing">I</COREF> had *T*-1 was not as hard as others imagine .
Perhaps <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's because people before <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="chaoxing">me</COREF> had long established a set of models .
<COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="chaoxing">I</COREF> 'd like *PRO*-1 to ask <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-2 have passed CPA exams in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF></COREF> whether <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are making a good living .
It *EXP*-1 's also very hard for <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="chaoxing">me</COREF> to pass the CPA exams in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> .
And now in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> , <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="chaoxing">I</COREF> may find an average school 0 *PRO* to study for a master 's degree *T*-1 , and then , and then do <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="chaoxing">I</COREF> have *-2 to start *-3 preparing for CPA exams here too ?
Also , in <COREF ID="6" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> CPA and certified tax agents are separate .
In <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> , are there exams for certified tax agents ?
Is the work of tax agents done *-1 by accounting firms as well in <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the US</COREF> ?
