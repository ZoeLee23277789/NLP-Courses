Who *T*-1 to Look into <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the Backroom Deals Behind <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">the Privatization of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">State - owned Shandong Luneng Group</COREF></COREF></COREF> ?
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Yun Dan Shui Nuan</COREF>
As <COREF ID="1__30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the year</COREF> <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">2006</COREF></COREF> ended , so did *T*-1 <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">a big hush - hush " deal</COREF> . "
Caijing Magazine described <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as " a quiet change of ownership for <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">this vast business empire</COREF> . "
These were the final few steps as <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">Shandong Luneng Group</COREF> " completed " <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> privatization</COREF> .
In the past , when <COREF ID="1__133" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="tangchaoZX">I</COREF> heard <COREF ID="1__46" TYPE="IDENT">the big name of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group</COREF></COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1__133" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="tangchaoZX">I</COREF> usually would link <COREF ID="1__46" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with soccer .
<COREF ID="1__133" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="tangchaoZX">I</COREF> could never expect 0 <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a 73.805 billion yuan giant .
Yet , in <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">the privatization of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">this giant</COREF></COREF> , it turns out that <COREF ID="1__57" TYPE="IDENT">the fairy tale of " big returns on a tiny outlay "</COREF> once again played <COREF ID="1__57" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> out .
It *EXP*-1 was incredible that <COREF ID="1__57" TYPE="IDENT">the fairy tale</COREF> once again played <COREF ID="1__57" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> out as the former senior managers of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">a state - owned company</COREF> changed in the blink of an eye into the " bosses " of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">a " private " company</COREF> .
Given <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">these fairy tales</COREF> , we should ask what backroom deals there were *T*-1 behind <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> .
Behind a fairy tale there must <COREF ID="1__unknown-E3" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> backroom deals .
<COREF ID="1__unknown-E3" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is now almost an undisputed truth .
There 's never been a money fairy or goddess of wealth who *T*-1 gives wealth to anyone without any reason .
<COREF ID="1__89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Zhang Rongkun</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the main player in the Shanghai social insurance case</COREF> , with a " new " company that *T*-1 was just registered *-2 and claimed *PRO*-2 to have 500 million in capital , was nevertheless able *PRO*-3 to acquire the 99.35 % stake in Shanghai Luqiao held * by Shanghai Chengtou at a price of 3.2 billion yuan .
Gu Chujun , with a mere 900 million , " acquired " top - quality state - owned assets with a total asset value of 13.6 billion .
<COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">The backroom deals behind</COREF> have already been revealed *-1 , and have entered into legal procedures .
And <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">the privatization process of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">Shandong Luneng</COREF></COREF> is also bound up with " <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">acquisition</COREF> . "
And in <COREF ID="1__30" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> , the " final " total " cost " of <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">this acquisition</COREF> , according to a report in <COREF ID="1__116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the magazine</COREF> <COREF ID="1__116" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Caijing</COREF> , was 3.73 billion yuan .
<COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was described *-1 by some as " 3 billion buys up 76 billion . "
For the " buyers , " you could use the minute probability , zero probability such as *PRO* winning the lottery or pie falling from the sky as an analogy .
This means backroom deals .
First , according to the <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Caijing</COREF> report , <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng 's</COREF> privatization process</COREF> lasted <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">11 years</COREF> <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">-LRB- 1995 - 2006 -RRB-</COREF> .
From state controlling stake → employee stock ownership with state investment → 100 % state controlled → employee stock ownership → <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">private ownership</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has gone through five stages .
Yet , in <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">this process</COREF> , the real inside story is little known .
" *PRO* Sneak into the village ; *PRO* do n't fire the guns . "
In particular , <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">the final stage of privatization</COREF> turned out *-1 to be " top secret . "
<COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The magazine</COREF> <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Caijing</COREF></COREF> reports : " The names of <COREF ID="2__28" TYPE="IDENT">the two ' new owners ' of <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng</COREF></COREF> were once called *-1 *PRO*-2 ' the top secrets of top secrets ' among a very small circle inside <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng</COREF> .
Now it is exactly <COREF ID="2__28" TYPE="IDENT">these two mysterious companies , whose names *T*-1 are unknown</COREF> , that *T*-2 have taken over absolute stock control over <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">this financial conglomerate</COREF> . "
Ordinary people would think that since <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's a well - known former state - owned company with huge assets that *T*-1 is connected *-2 with investment and operations in a large number of fields and connected *-2 with state - owned assets of enormous value , every step of <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> changes should be taken *-3 in the light of day , completed *-3 under the supervision of the relevant regulations , and inspected *-3 under the gaze of the public and the media .
If it 's all rule - abiding , reasonable and legal , then why *PRO* fear exposure *T*-1 ? Why all in secret , hidden * away , veiled * *T*-2 ?
Only if you know 0 you have done <COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">something dishonest</COREF> , will you be so much afraid of people knowing and try *PRO*-1 to make <COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> " the top secret of the top secrets . "
Secondly , at the recently concluded plenary meeting of <COREF ID="2__71" TYPE="IDENT">the Central Discipline Inspection Commission</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__71" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> required and emphasized strict monitoring of corrupt practices in the financial sector by party members and leading cadres , particularly in the area of the transfer of state - owned assets .
<COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__83" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group 's</COREF> former chairman</COREF> <COREF ID="2__86" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Gao XX</COREF></COREF> and <COREF ID="2__87" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group 's</COREF> former director - general</COREF> <COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Xu X</COREF></COREF> , who *T*-1 have " already " changed into " private entrepreneurs</COREF> , " " continue *-2 to serve <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> former posts " in <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">the new " private company</COREF> . "
So , did <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">these two Party members</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="2__83" TYPE="IDENT">Gao XX</COREF> previously held the positions of chief of the Shandong Linyi administrative office , deputy head of the electrical utility bureau , assistant to the head of the <COREF ID="2__unknown-E8" TYPE="IDENT">Shandong</COREF> electricity bureau , and general manager and party secretary of Shandong Luneng Stock Controlling Group . *PRO*-1 Having gone through all of <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng 's</COREF> stock transfers , <COREF ID="2__83" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is still currently the chairman of <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group</COREF> . <COREF ID="2__87" TYPE="IDENT">Xu X</COREF> has served as head of the electrical utility bureau of Linyi , <COREF ID="2__unknown-E8" TYPE="IDENT">Shandong</COREF> . In about 2003 <COREF ID="2__87" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> first entered the headquarters of <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group</COREF> as vice president assigned * *PRO*-2 to manage property operations , after which <COREF ID="2__87" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was very quickly promoted *-3 to the president of <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group</COREF> *T*-4 -RRB- , in the process of the series of mysterious stock deals at <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group</COREF> , carry out the unshirkable duties which the party members should undertake *T*-5 regarding state - owned assets and the public interest in strict accordance with the CPC Charter and the Party 's strict discipline ?

<TEXT PARTNO="001">
Did <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> seek private gains for a small group or for <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> ?
If it was all above board , <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should submit a report *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 *ICH*-3 to the party organization on <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the process of <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> transformation</COREF> from the senior management cadres of <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">a state - owned company</COREF> into " private entrepreneurs " and even announce <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to the public .
Thirdly , according to a 1998 audit report , when <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Shandong Luneng Group</COREF> was first established *-1 in 1995 *T*-2 , <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had 150 million yuan in registered capital , and operational assets of 2.6 billion yuan .
A more concrete image is " just five people and one office " <COREF ID="1__unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">expanding</COREF> at an unimaginable speed in just 11 short years into <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Shandong 's 73.805 billion yuan giant , incorporating coal - fired power stations , mining , real estate , engineering and construction , finance and sports clubs</COREF> .
In <COREF ID="1__unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this process</COREF> , where did <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group</COREF> get <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> assets and opportunities for expansion *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng 's</COREF> background and <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng 's</COREF> " birth " are inseparable from the state - owned monopoly of <COREF ID="1__54" TYPE="IDENT">the electricity industry</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__54" TYPE="IDENT">The electricity industry</COREF> has huge assets and occupies a market position of natural monopoly .
During <COREF ID="1__unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng 's</COREF> rapid expansion</COREF> , how much " blood " <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> actually extracted *T*-1 from state - owned assets seems *-2 to be <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">a " cloudy issue</COREF> . "
What 's the idea with *PRO* scrambling *PRO*-1 to " complete " privatization before <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> is cleared *-2 up , handed *-2 over to the public and announced *-2 to the media *T*-3 ?
Fourthly , it *EXP*-1 's said that <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__unknown-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the two private " companies " that *T*-2 finally " assumed ownership " of <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="1__unknown-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Guoyuan Union Co. and Shouda Nengyuan Energy Co.</COREF></COREF> -- according to descriptions in the media , <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">these two companies</COREF> can be called *-3 *PRO*-4 " low profile " and " mysterious . "
If it was an open and above - board " assumption of ownership , " then why the " mystery *T*-1 ? " Why the " low profile *T*-2 ? "
According to reports , the origins , backgrounds and sources of capital for <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">these two companies</COREF> are completely beyond comprehension .
Is it *EXP*-1 possible that by some kind of " *PRO* buying from yourself " process <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have embezzled state - owned assets ?
Fifthly , the departments supervising state - owned assets and the electricity industry are <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">SASAC and SERC , respectively</COREF> .
But with <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Shandong Luneng Group</COREF> undergoing such enormous changes , <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> " do not know what *T*-1 's going on . "
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> say , " <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> have not yet received <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group 's</COREF> application materials for the transfer of stocks . "
But what *T*-1 's strange is that according to reports by journalists , <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Luneng Group 's</COREF> business registration has in fact already " been adjusted *-2 . "
What *T*-1 's more , " since November 2006 , Shandong Provincial Administration of Industry and Commerce has not allowed requests *PRO* to see *RNR*-2 or inquire about *RNR*-2 the files of <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the Luneng family of companies</COREF> . "
What on earth does this mean *T*-1 ?
Is it the Caijing reporter " making rumors , " or are <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">the relevant departments</COREF> neglecting <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> supervision ?
No matter how it is *T*-1 , now that the media have publicly reported on it , there ought *-2 to be some answer .
So , who exactly will *T*-1 look into these backroom deals that *T*-2 have been exposed *-3 by current reports ?
