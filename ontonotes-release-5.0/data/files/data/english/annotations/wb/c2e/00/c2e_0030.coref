A few days ago , <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">another Taiwanese star</COREF> <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">passed</COREF> away .
<COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="conjee">I</COREF> had never heard of <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="conjee">I</COREF> hear 0 <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was a talented beauty .
What a great pity !
<COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">The accident</COREF> was a car crash .
Much of the entertainment news denounced that <COREF ID="1__46" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">+her</COREF> car 's</COREF> front airbag failed *-1 to release , which *T*-2 caused <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the death</COREF> .
In fact , <COREF ID="1__46" TYPE="IDENT">the MINI COOPER 0 <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was riding in *T*-1</COREF> is not what the reports said *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="1__c2e_0030.part-000.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is the car with the highest safety index .
<COREF ID="1__c2e_0030.part-000.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is sold *-1 for 190,000 HK dollars in Hong Kong .
Polo also sells for more than 140,000 HK dollars .
<COREF ID="1__c2e_0030.part-000.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's just a cute little car , preferred * by girls .
But safety is surely not too big of a problem .
The collision happened on the side and rear .
So , <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the side airbag and <COREF ID="1__c2e_0030.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">air curtain</COREF></COREF> were fully opened *-1 .
<COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> opened at the time of <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">first collision with <COREF ID="1__72" TYPE="IDENT">the protective fence</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">The first collision</COREF> was with <COREF ID="1__72" TYPE="IDENT">the protective fence only</COREF> , and the impact on the people was very small .
In addition , there was the protection of <COREF ID="1__c2e_0030.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the air curtain</COREF> .
So , there would surely not be a big problem .
<COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">The real fatal collision</COREF> was the second one from the tailgating truck .
At that time , all the airbags were already deflated .
There was no protective effect .
Furthermore , the force of <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">this one</COREF> was extremely large .
If <COREF ID="1__46" TYPE="IDENT">the car</COREF> had been stopped *-1 at an angle , then the head of the person sitting on one side would surely have hit the glass or the B column .
Meanwhile , there would not have been too much of a problem for someone on the other side .
This is common knowledge .
Then it came down to who *T*-1 had the bad luck of *PRO*-2 sitting on the side of <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the car</COREF> that *T*-3 was angled *-4 out .
It *EXP*-1 was perfectly correct for <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the front airbag</COREF> not to open , because the front of <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the car</COREF> was not damaged *-2 at all .
None of the sensors received any signal of a collision .
*PRO* Just imagine , this was a rear collision .
<COREF ID="2__15" TYPE="IDENT">The people</COREF> went backward abruptly .
<COREF ID="2__15" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> bodies could have been supported *-1 by the seats , but the impact on <COREF ID="2__15" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> necks and heads was tremendous .
When <COREF ID="2__15" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> went abruptly backward *T*-1 , any additional misfortune of <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the front airbag</COREF> opening for no reason would have eliminated any chance of survival .
So , of all the cars in the world , even a Rolls - Royce , <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the front airbag</COREF> will not open during a rear collision .
If <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the front airbag</COREF> <COREF ID="2__unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">opened</COREF> after *PRO* being tailgated *-1 , <COREF ID="2__unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would be a quality problem , and would be extremely dangerous .
The safety airbag 's eruption could knock someone to death .
So , infants are strictly forbidden *-1 from *PRO*-2 sitting in the front seat .
That was how the whole accident took place *T*-1 .
The result of the accident investigation division will not be different from this .
For this kind of accident , conclusions can be drawn *-1 from a single glance at the car wreckage .
<COREF ID="2__54" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">The car</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the car manufacturer</COREF></COREF> have no fault .
<COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">All of <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the car 's</COREF> passive safety protections</COREF> had already fully carried out <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> functions .
So , it *EXP*-1 is extremely ridiculous and unscientific *PRO* to blame and suspect <COREF ID="2__54" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the car</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the car manufacturer</COREF></COREF> for such an accident .
In particular , speculation about why <COREF ID="2__c2e_0030.part-001.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the front airbags</COREF> did not open *T*-1 was very amateurish .
Only by *PRO* not opening would it have been correct .
If <COREF ID="2__c2e_0030.part-001.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had opened , <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> assistant might still be lying in the hospital .
If an accident occurs on the freeway , please *PRO* get out of the car and leave immediately if you can move .
Many freeway accidents occur simply because <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> stay inside the car and sort out <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> thoughts , following which there is a fatal crash from a car following behind *T*-1 .
About death , <COREF ID="1__107" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="conjee">I</COREF> have always believed that <COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not leave <COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> only leave the human world .
<COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are surely sharing <COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="IDENT">the same world</COREF> with us , with a different manifestation of life .

It is in change that we find purpose *T*-1 .
