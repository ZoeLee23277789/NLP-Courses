    She needs a strong man of the times, an outstanding revolutionary and politician who is fully focused on, as well as
    capable of, making the Chinese nation prosperous and strong, and making the Chinese people wealthy and happy ; she
    neither needs nor accepts those shameless opportunists and hoodlum politicians who betray and sacrifice the political
    and economic interests of the entire nation and all of the people for themselves, their own family clan, and their own
    small clique and small social stratum, for the sake of their own gratitude or resentment, prestige, and interests,
    leaving the Chinese nation and the Chinese people to suffer loss, disaster, and humiliation.

Plain sentence:
---------------
    She needs a giant of the times and an outstanding politician who spares no effort in performing his duty to make the
    Chinese nation rise and stand out among the thicket of the world's nations, to allow the Chinese people to proudly live
    in happiness and harmony in the world, with heads high and chests out ; she neither needs nor accepts those national
    scum and common enemies of the people who for themselves, their own family clan, and their own small clique and small
    social stratum, for the sake of their own gratitude or resentment, prestige, and interests, make the Chinese nation and
    the Chinese people inferior or second-rate in the world.
