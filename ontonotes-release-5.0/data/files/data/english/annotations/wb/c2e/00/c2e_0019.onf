    This is because the former two given " fatherhood " are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and
    institution of the socialist new China, while the latter two dubbed " son " in this article--are indeed the ideological
    outcomes derived after the death of China's founder Comrade Mao Zedong under tremendous international and domestic
    political pressures on planned economy and public ownership, which grew into today's para-system after about 30 years of
    reform and opening up.

    Regarding this, my standpoint is : because the socialism underpinned by planned economy, public ownership and the
    people's democratic dictatorship is indeed a really " fresh " systemic thing for China in the mid and late 20th
    century--without a model or sufficient experience or theories to refer to, no matter how scientific its kernel is, it is
    hard not to have certain superficial and local problems.

Plain sentence:
---------------
    So, we can not urge the son to throttle the essentially healthy and scientific " father " system by fair mean or foul
    without considering the consequences, because there are problems in its practice and development--such as state monopoly
    for purchases and sales, lower efficiency due to centralized management, and inhibition of the will of productivity by
    undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new deal.

    All their criticisms are directed at the developmental symptoms such as " lower efficiency due to centralized management
    " or " inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during the new
    deal, " all their proclamations are political attacks and instigation aimed to win over the less than 5 % " vested
    interests, " and their development logic asks the " 95 % " laboring people to stay where they are and willingly endure
    the hard work--it speaks for itself how empty, ridiculous, sick, ignorant and anti-government it is.

Plain sentence:
---------------
    That's why I want to say to the world and the age by the end of the article : when the father's toes are injured, we
    should try our best to treat the foot problem, and open up a new life and embrace health in the principle of respecting
    human relations, obeying people's wishes, conforming to science and carrying on the legacy--if the present capitalist
    followers frantically urge the son to kill him by all means, the result could only be a tragedy !

Plain sentence:
---------------
    At last, I would like to admonish sincerely and earnestly those who blindly oppose, hate and even suppress planned
    economy, public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat, especially the " mainstream elite scholars " including Wu
    Jinglian, who insist on smearing the " father " to the end : do not treat the " fathers " on which the new civilization
    is based barbarously, against your conscience and frantically for immediate gains.
