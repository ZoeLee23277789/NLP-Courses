<COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">-- Some Thoughts on the Attitude of Benign Inheritance towards Social Reform .</COREF>
A glance at <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the title</COREF> , people with a little political sensitivity may roughly understand <COREF ID="33" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the core topic of <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">this article</COREF></COREF> : <COREF ID="33" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the rule of benign interaction between planned economy and market economy , and between public ownership and private ownership</COREF> -- because only <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> relationships are those between a father and a son , and it is only between <COREF ID="60" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> 0 are there different conflicts involving " human relations , " " rules " and " science , " as well as bloody wrestling between classes , factions and individuals on the basis of morality and interests *T*-1 .
*PRO* Comparing <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">planned economy and public ownership</COREF> to a father is tantamount to *PRO* comparing <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">market economy and private ownership</COREF> to a son , which *T*-1 <COREF ID="unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">holds</COREF> water principally and historically no matter 0 you put it this way or another .
<COREF ID="unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is because <COREF ID="61" TYPE="IDENT">the former two given * " fatherhood "</COREF> are indeed the most essential factors of the national character and institution of the socialist new China , while <COREF ID="65" TYPE="IDENT">the latter two dubbed * *PRO*-1 " son " in <COREF ID="34" TYPE="IDENT">this article</COREF></COREF> -- are indeed the ideological outcomes derived * after the death of <COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> founder</COREF> <COREF ID="89" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Comrade Mao Zedong</COREF> under tremendous international and domestic political pressures on planned economy and public ownership , which *T*-2 grew into today 's para-system after about 30 years of reform and opening up .
Regarding this , the factual development process of political civilization that the Marxist ideology has been increasingly marginalized *-1 over the past 30 years or so is a strong evidence .
By *PRO* sorting out the essence of the above historical background and conceptual relationships , we will have a pretty thorough , comprehensive and systematic knowledge framework about the benign inevitable trends and development guidelines of the future society dependent on the rule of society , so that the associated impression captured * may be more concrete .
Regarding this , <COREF ID="160" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">my</COREF> standpoint is : because <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">the socialism underpinned * by planned economy , public ownership and the people 's democratic dictatorship</COREF> is indeed a really " fresh " systemic thing for <COREF ID="88" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> in the mid and late 20th century -- without a model or sufficient experience or theories 0 *PRO* to refer to *T*-1 , no matter how scientific <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> kernel is *T*-2 , it *EXP*-3 is hard *PRO* not to have certain superficial and local problems .
However , this should not provide an excuse *PRO* to overthrow <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> by fair means or foul , as <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is our father and the common choice of millions of laboring people .
The fact that <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> " finally became our national character and main system after over half a century of international and domestic political transformation " is a stronger proof that <COREF ID="117" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is the milestone for a new civilization resulted * from the blood and sweat of thousands of proletarian revolutionary martyrs .

Therefore , no matter from the perspective of average citizens or from the standpoint of the founder of the new government , we should respect and develop her on the basis of inheritance , innovation and improvement .
Is <COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">my</COREF> opinion above correct ?
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> believe 0 you will naturally obtain a relatively fair and just conclusion if you could understand and treat <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the above - mentioned " father " system</COREF> and <COREF ID="unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">" son " system</COREF> with impartiality and sufficient goodwill .
For example , based on the existing institutional cultural heritage in the human history , we could see : 0 <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the " father " system mentioned * herein</COREF> has <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the majority</COREF> in mind or <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is established *-1 in the fundamental and long - term interests of <COREF ID="25" TYPE="IDENT">the majority</COREF> , as well as the need for sustainable and sound development of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> , the nation , and the overall society -- while <COREF ID="unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">the " son " system mentioned * herein</COREF> is ignorant and sick in the company of such behavioral characteristics as exploitation , fraudulence , pernicious influence and robbery .
So , we can not urge <COREF ID="unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">the son</COREF> *PRO*-1 to throttle <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the essentially healthy and scientific " father " system</COREF> by fair mean or foul without *PRO* considering the consequences , because there are problems in <COREF ID="unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> practice and development -- such as state monopoly for purchases and sales , lower efficiency due to centralized management , and inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the new deal</COREF> .
It is because <COREF ID="unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> will not only make the society increasingly ignorant and sick as <COREF ID="unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> violates the rule of benign social development , distorts <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">normal " human relations "</COREF> and the ethic and prevalent value and the rule of civilization update rooted * in <COREF ID="73" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , but the humanity will retrogress as people 's thoughts and behaviors become increasingly ridiculous .
Yes , this is the case .
<COREF ID="132" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">My</COREF> opinion above is not absurd and delusive at all , because this is true not only in theory , but also to the rule of social development as *PRO* demonstrated *-1 by historical facts , as well as from the perspective of the situation and reality of <COREF ID="33" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> : None of <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the current " advocates of market economy , private ownership and dictatorship of the bourgeoisie "</COREF> has established and proposed a new deal " against planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat . "
All <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> criticisms are directed *-1 at the developmental symptoms such as " lower efficiency due to centralized management " or " inhibition of the will of productivity by undue political pressure resulting from class struggles during <COREF ID="64" TYPE="IDENT">the new deal</COREF> , " all <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> proclamations are political attacks and instigation aimed *PRO* to win over the less than 5 % " vested interests , " and <COREF ID="c2e_0019.part-001.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> development logic</COREF> asks <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">the " 95 % " laboring people</COREF> *PRO*-2 to stay where <COREF ID="123" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *T*-3 and willingly endure the hard work -- <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> speaks for <COREF ID="126" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> how empty , ridiculous , sick , ignorant and anti-government <COREF ID="c2e_0019.part-001.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-4 .

That 's why <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to say to the world and <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the age</COREF> by the end of the article : when <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the father 's</COREF> toes are injured *-2 *T*-3 , we should try our best *PRO*-4 to treat the foot problem , and open up a new life and embrace health in the principle of *PRO* respecting human relations , obeying people 's wishes , conforming to science and carrying on the legacy *T*-6 -- if the present capitalist followers frantically urge the son *PRO*-5 to kill <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> by all means , the result could only be a tragedy !
And these happen *-1 to be the core of the destiny where <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">the capitalist roaders</COREF> " will inevitably bury <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> due to <COREF ID="31" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> ignorance and insanity , and more or less harm the human society *T*-2 ! "
At last , <COREF ID="79" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="613305">I</COREF> would like *PRO*-1 to admonish sincerely and earnestly those who *T*-2 blindly oppose , hate and even suppress planned economy , public ownership and dictatorship of the proletariat , especially the " mainstream elite scholars " including Wu Jinglian , who *T*-3 insist on *PRO*-4 smearing <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the " father "</COREF> to the end : *PRO* do not treat the " fathers " on which the new civilization is based *-5 *T*-6 barbarously , against your conscience and frantically for immediate gains .
The result is definitely a tragedy -- because even if you kill <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">the " father</COREF> , " your felony will be disdained *-1 by <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the age</COREF> and condemned *-1 by the people , which *T*-2 naturally leads to nothing good !
