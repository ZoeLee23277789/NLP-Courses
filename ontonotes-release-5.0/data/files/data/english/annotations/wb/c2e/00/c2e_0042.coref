*PRO* Be Your Own Psychiatrist .
Li Xu .
In today 's society , fierce competition , cultural conflicts and material temptation disturb our minds incessantly , which *T*-1 often make us feel worried , anxious , upset and furious .
<COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">People</COREF> also try *PRO*-1 to adjust <COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> in <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">material ways</COREF> , but <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">those</COREF> often fail *-2 to work : exercises can not lessen the concerns at heart ; physical and mental fatigue persist not long after *PRO* traveling ; the soft water bed can not bring comfortable sleeps ; and the luxurious room can not dispel the disputes of spouses .
That 's why someone proposes that modern people learn a new survival skill -- *PRO* learn *PRO*-1 to be your own psychiatrist , *PRO* helping yourself to dissolve all sorts of metal stresses at work and in life *T*-2 .
*PRO* Be your own psychiatrist , *PRO* simply put *-1 , is *PRO* to improve your ability *PRO* adjust yourself psychologically .
*PRO* To elaborate , it means 0 there should be a special role in your mind who *T*-1 possesses " the third eye " mentally *PRO* to observe your emotional changes sensibly and find out the reasons for mental disturbances .
It is just like the " guardian angel " whom everyone has *T*-1 in Western legends , who *T*-2 gives you wisdom at critical moments and help you deal with the intricate reality properly , so that you will not lose direction .
There was <COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">a famous British psychologist named * *PRO*-1 Ellis *ICH*-2</COREF> in the last century , who *T*-3 encouraged people *PRO*-4 to learn a special , reasonable and healthy way of thinking by *PRO* reading professional books , organizing group discussions and doing specific training in *PRO* thinking , in order *PRO* to deal with emotional problems caused * by stresses .
<COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> should be the first one 0 *T*-1 to advocate " *PRO* learn *PRO*-2 to be your own psychiatrist . "
<COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> encourages people *PRO*-1 to learn a new way of thinking like *PRO* " learning a foreign language . "
The most important aspect in *PRO* being your own psychiatrist is *PRO* to learn *PRO*-1 to substitute the healthy way of thinking for the unhealthy way of thinking .
For example , *PRO* ask two people *PRO*-1 to observe the same glass , if <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">one</COREF> notices a tiny speckle and <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the other</COREF> notices the mild color , then <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the former 's</COREF> thinking pattern might be pessimistic , while <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the latter</COREF> might be more sensitive to the positive aspect of things , which *T*-2 is a healthy and optimistic way of thinking .
Thus , *PRO* learn *PRO*-1 to observe the positive aspect of things has become an important training .
*PRO* To be your own psychiatrist , you should also learn *PRO*-1 to observe stress - related signs .
For example , if you have a stomachache , your normal response is *PRO* to see a gastroenterologist .
Through observation by " the third eye , " you may see that the reason can be your new demanding boss .
*PRO* To be your own psychiatrist , you also need *-1 to learn appropriate knowledge .
There was <COREF ID="2__39" TYPE="IDENT">a student at the Tsinghua University , who *T*-1 were troubled *-2 by <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="IDENT">" depression "</COREF> for a while</COREF> .
When <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was bad *T*-1 , <COREF ID="2__39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wanted *PRO*-2 to jump out and commit suicide at the sight of a window .
With some psychological knowledge , <COREF ID="2__39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> knew 0 <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was a symptom of mental disorder , so <COREF ID="2__39" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> immediately sought help from professionals and received treatment soon .
Now in <COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">many European and American countries</COREF> , some intellectuals including young college students like *PRO*-1 to read psychological books .
Psychological books can always be seen *-1 in the best seller lists in <COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">these countries</COREF> .
Most readers do not aim *PRO*-1 to become counsellors , but to learn psychological knowledge *PRO* to help personal growth .
Such healthy awareness is worth *PRO* learning .
This july , lemonade , music , and the summer breeze .
