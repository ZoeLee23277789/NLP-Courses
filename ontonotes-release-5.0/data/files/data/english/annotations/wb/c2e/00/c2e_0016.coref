Is Blast Demolition Implementation of <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">the Scientific View of Development</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">Wenhai .</COREF>
While <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was watching <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="IDENT">a TV channel</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> heard from <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> news , " <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">the tallest building beside <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the West Lake in <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">Hangzhou</COREF></COREF></COREF> was blast <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">demolished</COREF> *-1 only 14 years after completion , because <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ruined <COREF ID="1__28" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">West Lake</COREF> views</COREF> . "
It *EXP*-1 is said *-2 0 *PRO* <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">blasting</COREF> <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">this " image project "</COREF> reflects " the scientific view of development " of this <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">Hangzhou</COREF> government .
It *EXP*-1 is unbelievable *PRO* to see the report associate <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">the blast demolition</COREF> with <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">the scientific view of development</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">The high riser</COREF> has only been used *-1 for 14 years .
What does it mean *T*-1 by 14 years ?
If some messy buildings are left *-1 *PRO*-2 undecorated after six years of completion , <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it *EXP*-3 is not inappropriate at all *PRO* to describe 14 years as " brand new . "
It took such a great fortune *PRO* to build a high riser like <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> , and now <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">blasted</COREF> *-1 at an order .
How wasteful it is *T*-1 in ordinary people 's eyes .
<COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> will never ever believe 0 everyone in <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">Hangzhou</COREF> has a place 0 *PRO* to live in *T*-1 without any impoverished households .
If <COREF ID="1__66" TYPE="IDENT">such a great fortune</COREF> was from government appropriation , how many tax payers were *T*-1 needed *-2 ?
If <COREF ID="1__66" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was invested *-1 by some business person , how many machines were *T*-2 needed *-3 to run and how many workers were *T*-4 needed *-5 to be busy ?
How many people can *T*-1 receive education and healthcare , among other things , with such a great fortune ?
What is <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">the scientific view of development</COREF> *T*-1 ?
The core is putting people first .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">The scientific view of development</COREF> will never waste resources at will , or let people bleed and toil in vain .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">The scientific view of development</COREF> emphasizes a conservation - minded society .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">The scientific view of development</COREF> focuses on urban planning .
Maybe some people say 0 <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">this tall building</COREF> has ruined <COREF ID="1__28" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">West Lake</COREF> views</COREF> , and now we have attached importance to <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">the scientific view of development</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would say please *PRO* wait .
If <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">Hangzhou</COREF> has <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">only this one " image project , " the blast of which *T*-1 could restore <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> original state</COREF> , it can be barely regarded *-2 as " scientific development . "
The problem is whether it will work ?
<COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">Hangzhou</COREF> belongs to people of the entire nation .
So many Chinese have been to <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">Hangzhou</COREF> .
The Leifeng Tower was fallen down for years , which *T*-2 also symbolized the emancipation of Chinese women , but later on a lot of money was invested *-1 *PRO* to build <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">a fake tower standing beside <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the West Lake</COREF></COREF> .
A tour guide said : " <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> often went up *PRO* to explore the relics before <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was built *-1 , but <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have become reluctant *PRO*-2 to go up after <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was built *-3 . "
This affects <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the West Lake</COREF> , *PRO* reducing tourists at <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the scenic spot</COREF> .
Should we also push over <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">the fake Leifeng Tower</COREF> ?
Even if <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> were pushed *-1 over , would things go back to " people going up *PRO*-2 to explore relics ? "
Thus , *PRO* blasting <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">the high riser</COREF> can not be associated *-1 with the scientific view of development .
When <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was first built *-1 *T*-2 , <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was for image in spite of public objections .
Some netizens even said 0 <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was for political feats , dining out , *PRO* going on inspection tours , contract awarding , and various other benefits .
If the construction was for image , then the scientific view of development should never be the excuse for <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> blast demolition .
If it is really designed *-1 *PRO*-2 to implement the scientific view of development , then simply *PRO* erect a plate *ICH*-3 at <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">the " fake Leifeng Tower</COREF> , " which *T*-4 indicates " who *T*-5 " managed the construction of <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">the fake tower</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> guarantee 0 there will be tourists exploring relics .
