Select and buy according to the following : .
Internal support characteristics .
Multidirectional movement during aerobic exercise requires extremely solid shoes .
Each manufacturer provides different internal support characteristics .
Some manufacturers use a molded midsole , so that the foot can land just right inside the shoe ; fibers going all around the shoes can also provide support .
In order to increase shoe flexibility , some manufacturers add a fiberboard padding only at the heel .
External support .
A firm , resistant heel support can greatly reduce heel displacement .
The wider part of the outsole is called the heel fixed strip .
It is made of plastic and spreads all the way around the foot , attached to the heel support .
Many shoes now use a fixed frame ; the fixed frame is a polymer part that is used as support and is distributed longitudinally around the outside of the shoe .
Other stability characteristics include a plastic support strip -LRB- generally connected to the eyelets -RRB- , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Velcro</ENAMEX> hook , middle uppers can also provide side support characteristics .
Shock absorption .
Repeated impacts during aerobic exercise produces unique pressures that generally correspond to <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">five</ENAMEX> times your body weight .
Therefore good shock - absorbing performance is essential .
The midsole helps to disperse these impacts .
A good midsole is made from extruded EVA or polyurethane .
The various manufacturers have come up with various technologies to further increase the midsole 's shock absorption .
If you are someone with insufficient downward tilting , or engage in intense exercise , you may require greater shock absorption than people with excess downward tilting .
Replaceable insoles .
The insole also has a certain shock - absorbing function , but at the same time it is the easiest to ruin .
As for replacing the insole when the shoe is halfway through its life , there is a basic principle involved ; after <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">150 hours</ENAMEX> of aerobic exercise , the insole may lose its bounce , and this is when it should be replaced .
-LRB- This varies according to the person and the type of training . -RRB-
Elasticity .
A shoe 's elasticity is determined by how you feel when your feet move .
Shoes with just a fiberboard pad at the heel have better flexibility than athletic shoes using a complete fiberboard design .
Athletic shoes with low uppers can also improve flexibility .
Fit .
Your feet may swell when they are under pressure and engaging in aerobic exercise .
The heat produced by intense exercise may cause the feet to swell by <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">half</ENAMEX> a size .
At the same time , when you buy shoes they should not be too tight ; there should be a space as wide as a thumbnail between the tip of the shoe and your longest toe to ensure that your toes can move freely , and it should fit properly at the heel .
In addition , you should regularly measure the length of your feet , because increasing age and injuries can change the size of your feet .

That 's too much !
Will the feet turn into <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">three - inch</ENAMEX> " Golden Lotuses " from <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> day to the next !

After <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">150 hours</ENAMEX> of aerobic exercise , insoles may lose their elasticity , that is when they should be replaced .
This is too dogmatic !

I reckon this refers to domestically produced shoes .
But after you add an insole , the impact on the knee joints is much less .
The kind of heel insoles on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Wal - Mart</ENAMEX> pharmacy shelves are OK .
