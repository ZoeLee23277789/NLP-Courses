<COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">â–¡ <COREF ID="1__28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Morgan Stanley 's leading economist</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Stephen Roach</COREF> .</COREF>
Several major lessons of <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> rather reasonably explain <COREF ID="1__unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the main developing trends in <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">last year 's</COREF> markets</COREF> , namely that the current situation in the financial markets embodies the effects of <COREF ID="1__unknown-E2" TYPE="IDENT">all these developments</COREF> interacting with one another .
In particular , in an era of excess current capital , risk capital high - income company bonds , structural credit products , emerging market securities and even staple commodities will be the next bubble .
<COREF ID="1__c2e_0021.part-000.aif-E13" TYPE="IDENT">Global rebalancing .</COREF>
<COREF ID="1__c2e_0021.part-000.aif-E13" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is a topic that <COREF ID="1__145" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">I</COREF> have spent much of the last five years *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to get people to be concerned *-3 about *T*-4 .
*PRO* To put it simply , <COREF ID="1__unknown-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the rebalancing theory</COREF> holds that if <COREF ID="1__unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">the gap between countries with trade surpluses and deficits</COREF> continues *-1 to expand , <COREF ID="1__unknown-E5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will harm the sustained growth of <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the world 's</COREF> economy .
In the last two years , regular account deficits in <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> averaged more than 800 billion dollars annually ; <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S.</COREF> accepted nearly 70 % of the earned surplus reserve of <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the world 's</COREF> other countries , the equivalent of *PRO* needing *-1 to bring in some 35 billion dollars per average business day in outside financial burden .
In a nutshell , the rebalancing plan 0 <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> so urgently needs *T*-1 is nothing more than a thorough reshaping of the global savings mix - that is , an improvement in the U.S. savings rate , which *T*-2 has been stagnant for a long time , and a lessening of excessive savings in other countries -LRB- especially in <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__94" TYPE="IDENT">Asia</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF></COREF> -RRB- .
If <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the world 's</COREF> savings mix does not change , the rebalancing theory holds that the situation will be very harmful to outside financing in deficit economic systems .
As for <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> , this will augur <COREF ID="1__104" TYPE="IDENT">low exchange rates for the U.S. dollar , and an expansion of effective interest rates on U.S. - dollar capital</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="1__104" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> did not happen in <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> .
Although as the end of <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF> approached the U.S. dollar dropped somewhat , and effective interest rates continued *-1 to climb , this movement was still very far from the radical adjustments predicted * by the framework of <COREF ID="1__unknown-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the rebalancing theory</COREF> .
This phenomenon has two possible explanations : <COREF ID="1__122" TYPE="IDENT">one</COREF> is that other factors cropped up and intervened ; the other is that <COREF ID="1__unknown-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the theory</COREF> basically does not stand up .
<COREF ID="1__145" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">I</COREF> choose <COREF ID="1__122" TYPE="IDENT">the former</COREF> ; <COREF ID="1__145" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">I</COREF> believe 0 the reason lies in <COREF ID="1__130" TYPE="IDENT">the prolongation of the period of excess current capital worldwide and the policy of central banks in <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__94" TYPE="IDENT">Asia</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">the Middle East</COREF></COREF> of *PRO* buying up U.S. dollars</COREF> .
So long as <COREF ID="1__130" TYPE="IDENT">these forces</COREF> are in play , the effects on financial markets recognized * by <COREF ID="1__unknown-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the rebalancing theory</COREF> will continue *-1 to be softened *-2 .
Globalized tracks .
<COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">Last year</COREF> was an important milestone in the globalization process .
*PRO*-1 Benefiting from an acceleration in the pace of transnational integration , global trade for the first time accounted for a record - setting 30 % - plus of global GDP in <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> .
From 1998 to <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> , the increase in global trade accounted for fully 42 % of the overall increase in the world 's total output value .
This kind of trade concentration has the potential for a huge macroeconomic impact on global growth .
The rapidly exploding supply of goods and services from low - production - cost developing countries is equivalent in terms of function to a strong anti-inflationary counterblast blowing on the developed world .
Despite rapid rises in energy costs , it *EXP*-2 is estimated *-1 that in <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> the CPI inflation rate in the industrialized countries was only 24 % , about the same as inflation levels in 2005 , which *T*-3 were affected *-4 by energy factors , but each year 's " core " elements did not change much .
Although the labor and product markets in most large industrial nations are gradually improving , sustained low inflation is increasingly becoming a global force , *PRO*-1 exerting an effective counterbalance effect on internal pressures that *T*-2 have always contributed to inflation in developed countries .
U.S. Real Estate Bubble Shock .
Like <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market bubble six years ago</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">another prime - assets bubble</COREF> burst in <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> ; this time <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was the huge U.S. real estate bubble .
Just as the bursting of <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the 2000 - 01 stock market bubble</COREF> led to mild collapse , <COREF ID="1__145" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">I</COREF> am worried that people are discarding too quickly the risk of a similar situation occurring in 2007 .
First , adjustment of the housing market has just begun ; *PRO* taking the number of workers in <COREF ID="2__76" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. home construction industry</COREF> as an example , current figures are only 15 % below the cumulative increase over the last five years .
Second , <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">over-indebted American consumers with <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> insufficient savings</COREF> are using <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> increasingly overvalued houses *PRO* to support <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> excessive consumption ; and now housing prices are turning soft , <COREF ID="2__87" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> are losing <COREF ID="2__87" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rights *PRO* to redeem <COREF ID="2__87" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mortgage , and consumer demand will face greater pressures .
Third , in the presence of a dim outlook for housing and consumer markets and high sensitivity to forecasts of ultimate market demand , capital expenditure plans may slacken ; orders for core capital products declined consecutively in November and December , <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> , *PRO* indicating that the adjustment in this area may already be under way .
Just like <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market bubble six years ago</COREF> , widespread public opinion holds that any damage done * by <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">the recent asset bubble</COREF> will be kept *-1 within <COREF ID="2__76" TYPE="IDENT">the U.S. housing construction industry</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__145" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">I</COREF> believe 0 this is a classic example of *PRO* not learning our lesson .

The Staple Commodities Cycle .
<COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">The view that commodity markets have supercycles</COREF> ran into a serious challenge in <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">Oil prices</COREF> slipped by more than 25 % from <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mid-July peak and the price of natural gas fell by more than 30 % , and prices for major metals like copper , which *T*-1 are sensitive to economic trends , showed signs of *PRO*-2 weakening at the end of <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">the year</COREF> .
The main premise of <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the supercycle theory</COREF> hangs on <COREF ID="1__23" TYPE="IDENT">an extremely reliable shortage of staple commodities</COREF> ; <COREF ID="1__23" TYPE="IDENT">this shortage</COREF> was created *-1 because in the last 20 - odd years there has been a shortage of capital 0 *PRO* to invest *T*-2 in *PRO* building new capacity for acquisition and processing .
Whereas the advance of globalization will spur sources of new demand from <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> , India and other commodity - intensive economic systems , asymmetry between supply and increasingly fierce demand causes exponents of supercycles to issue the highest commodity price forecasts in history .
In <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">my</COREF> view , this does not give adequate consideration to <COREF ID="1__51" TYPE="IDENT">latent demand cycles in commodity markets</COREF> .
The American real estate market shock is an example of <COREF ID="1__51" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> ; a sluggish market will cause demand for many materials sensitive to the homebuilding industry to drop sharply .
However , the real demand cycle may depend on <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">China</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">an economic system that *T*-1 accounts only for approximately 5 % of the world 's GDP , but whose increased consumption of oil and key metals *T*-2 accounted for fully 50 % of total global growth <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">last year</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
*PRO*-2 Influenced *-1 by <COREF ID="1__75" TYPE="IDENT">the slowing of exports to <COREF ID="-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> , combined * with the deliberate cool - down in the overheated investment sector</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> growth will slow <COREF ID="1__82" TYPE="IDENT">next year</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__75" TYPE="IDENT">These demand factors</COREF> will be adequate *PRO*-1 to deliver a decisive blow to <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the supercycle view of the supply - driven commodity market</COREF> .
But will the lessons of <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">2006</COREF> be the key to success in <COREF ID="1__82" TYPE="IDENT">2007</COREF> ?
Of course things are not as simple as that .
We can undoubtedly draw some important lessons and tips from last year 's economy , but there is another important thing here ; <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">I</COREF> still believe that the two main engines driving global growth will slow down under the influence of the burst real estate bubble in <COREF ID="-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the United States</COREF> and the cool - down in investments in <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> .
Even though <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">I</COREF> do not believe 0 the global economy is in for a hard landing , if global growth <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT">slips</COREF> one percentage point below the average of 49 % for the last four years , <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">I</COREF> will not think <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> unexpected .
<COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Cnews">My</COREF> greatest concern is that people continue *-1 to treat lightly <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the continually booming risk assets markets</COREF> ; <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> include high - yield corporate bonds , institutional credit products , emerging market securities and even staple commodities , and <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is going *-2 to be <COREF ID="2__47" TYPE="IDENT">the next bubble</COREF> .
However , like the stock and real estate markets , the economy tells us that the extreme case of <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the asset markets</COREF> can always last longer than we anticipate , particularly in a time of excess current capital , but if <COREF ID="2__47" TYPE="IDENT">the risk assets bubble</COREF> lasts another year , <COREF ID="2__47" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> may cause more problems .
