    [jilian] To speak of China's strategic nuclear strike capacity : with the successful test-firing of a submarine-based
    ICBM, and General Zhu Chenghu's revelation of China's strategic nuclear strike capacity sufficient to " bury hundreds of
    American cities even at the same time as all Chinese cities east of Xi'an were being destroyed, " the " intelligence "
    that the " highly effective " US intelligence departments have been assuredly apprising Japan and Taiwanese separatists
    of " for decades without changing " that " China has only 20 ICBMs capable of hitting the US, " has become a " joke "
    like " Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, " along with the mighty image of " a USA impervious to China's nuclear threat
    and capable of protecting Taiwanese separatists and Japanese who threaten China's core interests. "

    [jilian] As a result for the F-22, which has " impressive " stealth capabilities against airborne phased-array radar,
    but " greatly reduced " stealth capabilities against China's land-based high power phased-array radar and high power
    long-wavelength radar ; [jilian] given that they will not be supported by satellite intelligence, will not be supported
    by EWR aircraft intelligence, [jilian] given that the F-22 will be forced to turn on its own airborne radar to enter
    combat ; [jilian] given that all the airfields of the F-15 and F-16 squadrons of the " US and Japan " will be within the
    range of China's long-range armaments ; [jilian] faced with a large fleet of fighter planes made up of fighters such as
    the J-10s and J-11s with Beyond Visual Range air and sea strike capabilities, with land-based radar picking targets,
    carrying " pl-12 " medium-range guided air-to-air missiles, highly maneuverable and with a large enough combat radius ;
    as well as the J-8d and f, with their good high-altitude and high-speed features ; how much real chance of victory is
    there ?

    [jilian] Obviously, given China's ability to " attack the intelligence chain, " faced with China's mighty capacity for
    precision long-range strikes, unable to receive support from land or naval forces, as soon as they also lose the
    effective support of their advantageous military space reconnaissance satellites, in reality, the US air force and navy
    that rely heavily on space intelligence, with no superiority of numbers and far from its US homeland--we do n't think
    their chances of victory are great if they are fighting right next to China.
