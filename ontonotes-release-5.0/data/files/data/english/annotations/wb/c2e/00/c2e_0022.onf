Plain sentence:
---------------
    It is imperative to remove the environmental subsidies to domestic and foreign consumers, internalize external
    environmental costs of Chinese products as soon as possible, and increase the prices of most products, including
    exports, in order to alleviate international trade frictions, reduce the pressure for RMB appreciation, and in
    particular change the prospect that the Chinese environmental resources will seriously deteriorate.

    infrastructure and manufacturing, and insufficient investment in national defense, science and technology, education,
    health, environment and national reserves ; wider income gap, regional gap and gap between urban and rural areas ; the
    economy has become dependent on the US market to some extent due to long-term export orientation and trade surplus to
    the United States ; and environmental resource outflow by way of exporting, so on and so forth.
