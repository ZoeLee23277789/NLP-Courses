*PRO* Eliminate <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">the personal income tax</COREF> -LRB- *PRO* Reproduced *-1 from Yueguang blog -RRB- .
<COREF ID="1__118" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dift_Wu">Dift Wu</COREF>
Official data confirm that in 2004 the total personal income tax for <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> amounted to approximately 181 billion , of which 65 % *T*-1 came from the working class , and only 10 % *T*-1 came from the wealthy .
Clearly the personal income tax policy has too little effect on *PRO* controlling wealth accumulation by the rich , and too little impact on *PRO* improving the quality of life of wage earners .
While <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">this type of tax in <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF></COREF> has no effect on *PRO* regulating the income gap or on *PRO* " taking from the rich *PRO* to help the poor , " neither is <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> beneficial in *PRO* expanding the working class .
If <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">this tax</COREF> continues *-1 to be collected *-2 , <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be working against the original intention behind <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">the income tax</COREF> .
Clearly the necessity for <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">the personal income tax</COREF> needs *-1 to be challenged *-2 .
<COREF ID="1__118" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Dift_Wu">I</COREF> propose *PRO* eliminating <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">the personal income tax</COREF> just as the agricultural tax was eliminated *-1 , *PRO* to give people an opportunity *PRO* to prosper .
If we think in terms of *PRO* humanizing the system , i.e. , helping the poor by *PRO* letting poor people get rich , we should give <COREF ID="1__48" TYPE="IDENT">low - and moderate - income people</COREF> a chance *PRO* to improve and raise the quality of <COREF ID="1__48" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives ; <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">the threshold for <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> personal income tax</COREF></COREF> should <COREF ID="1__72" TYPE="IDENT">be</COREF> at least tripled *-1 from the starting threshold of 800 yuan per month , i.e. , to 6400 yuan per person .
<COREF ID="1__72" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> would take <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">a minimally humanized level</COREF> , and then we could really talk about " people first . "
With a threshold below <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">this level</COREF> , the poor will always be poor .
Yesterday CCTV presented a program on <COREF ID="1__72" TYPE="IDENT">adjustment of <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">the personal income tax</COREF></COREF> , emphasized that the main goal of <COREF ID="1__72" TYPE="IDENT">the adjustment</COREF> was *PRO* to " take from the rich " and let poor people get wealthy .
If we really want *PRO*-1 to give poor people a chance *PRO* to get wealthy , <COREF ID="1__c2e_0009.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the threshold for <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">the personal income tax</COREF></COREF> should be tripled *-2 .
With anything under <COREF ID="1__c2e_0009.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">this threshold</COREF> , the poor will have no chance *PRO* to get rich .
And if we 're looking at it in terms of *PRO* " taking from the rich , " the problem *PRO* to be adjusted *-1 is definitely not whether or not *PRO* to tax income but rather the problem of the actual method for *PRO* distributing <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> social national income , namely how *PRO* to eliminate the " unreported income *T*-2 . "
The income of the vast majority of <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> rich people is unreported income , and <COREF ID="1__103" TYPE="IDENT">unreported income</COREF> is a problem that Chinese society will not be able *PRO*-1 to solve *T*-2 for quite a long time 0 *T*-3 to come ; <COREF ID="1__103" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a characteristic of <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> , an uncontrollable black hole in <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> social oversight .
<COREF ID="1__103" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is far from *PRO* being a tax problem ; <COREF ID="1__103" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a deeper systemic problem .
If <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> personal income tax</COREF> can not achieve the effect of *PRO* helping the poor to become rich , neither can <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> control the excessive incomes of the wealthy , so what is it *T*-1 0 we expect <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">this personal income tax</COREF> to do *T*-2 ?
It *EXP*-1 would be better *PRO* to eliminate <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in one fell swoop , as we did with the agricultural tax .
Below are *T*-1 some of the main reasons :
1. <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> income tax</COREF> can not become a tool for *PRO* keeping the poor perpetually poor ; <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can not become a social tool that *T*-1 keeps on *-2 producing a penniless proletariat .
In <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT">the primary function of <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">the income tax</COREF></COREF> is *PRO* to increase <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> financial revenues ; <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not *PRO* to regulate the income gap .
In 2004 <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> income taxes amounted to <COREF ID="2__35" TYPE="IDENT">approximately 180 billion</COREF> , *PRO* accounting for about 6 % of <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> financial revenues .
But of <COREF ID="2__35" TYPE="IDENT">this 180 billion</COREF> , about 65 % , or 117 billion , was paid *-1 by the working class .
Less than 10 % was paid *-1 by the wealthy .
In <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> more than 90 % of the people who *T*-1 depend on fully declared total earnings for a living are <COREF ID="2__51" TYPE="IDENT">urban poor</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__51" TYPE="IDENT">These poor people , who *T*-1 struggle *PRO* just to pay for the necessities of life , <COREF ID="2__51" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> children 's education , old age , illness and death</COREF> , also have *-2 to pay income tax .
In all of <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> cities now , anyone with a monthly income of 2000 yuan or less is considered *-1 poor .
If <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">a husband and wife</COREF> have a total monthly work income of 2000 yuan , and if <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> pay 33 % income tax on anything over 1500 yuan , <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have a disposable income of only 1670 yuan .
<COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">A household like <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF></COREF> can not even continue *-1 bearing basic living expenses , and <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> standard of living will decline .
And should anyone in <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">the household</COREF> get sick and have *-1 to go to the hospital , <COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">the family</COREF> may well find <COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> in an economic crisis .
And if <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">a family like <COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF></COREF> wants *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="2__95" TYPE="IDENT">buy</COREF> <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> own home , <COREF ID="2__95" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> will basically be impossible .
And if only one person in <COREF ID="2__98" TYPE="IDENT">a three - person family</COREF> is employed *-1 , <COREF ID="2__98" TYPE="IDENT">the family</COREF> will have a very difficult life .
But even so , <COREF ID="2__98" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-1 to pay 165 yuan in income tax .
Clearly , if <COREF ID="2__122" TYPE="IDENT">our income tax threshold</COREF> is set *-1 at 1500 yuan , our society is destined *-2 *PRO*-3 always to produce a proletariat , always to deny hope *ICH*-4 to the poor or to the masses of *PRO* ever getting rich .
Our production relations are no different from the production relations in Marx 's " Das Kapital , " *PRO* constantly reproducing <COREF ID="2__117" TYPE="IDENT">a proletariat who *T*-1 can only rely on *PRO* selling <COREF ID="2__117" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> labor *PRO*-2 to make a living</COREF> .
In short , if <COREF ID="2__122" TYPE="IDENT">the personal income tax threshold</COREF> is set *-1 lower than 6400 yuan , <COREF ID="2__122" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be ineffective in *PRO* helping the poor get rich .
Conversely , if <COREF ID="2__122" TYPE="IDENT">the threshold</COREF> is too low , <COREF ID="2__122" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will cleanly and quickly inhibit the ability *ICH*-1 of poor people *PRO* to get rich .

2. <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">The personal income tax</COREF> is absolutely unable *PRO*-1 to control the accumulation of wealth by the rich .
We should not entertain any illusions that <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> income tax</COREF> can in any way regulate income distribution , much less that <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can " take from the rich and give to the poor . "
In Chinese society , <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">20 % of the people</COREF> hold 80 % of social wealth , and <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="IDENT">80 % of the people</COREF> are able *PRO*-1 to use only 20 % of the social wealth *PRO*-2 to suffer through <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives .
In <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> , freedom , human rights , democracy , happiness and all the other most effective benefits that society can offer *T*-1 refer only to 20 % of the people .
Western countries that *T*-1 attack <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> for *PRO*-2 not having human rights , democracy and freedom are quite wrong ; <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">these 20 % of upper - class citizens</COREF> have broader human rights , democracy and freedom than do Western societies .
When <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> looks at <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> sees only <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">these 20 %</COREF> ; <COREF ID="1__19" TYPE="IDENT">the other 80 %</COREF> <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> ca n't see *T*-2 clearly .
The income of <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">the vast majority of <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">these 20 , of upper - class citizens in <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF></COREF></COREF> is basically unreported income ; the proportion of <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> income that *T*-1 comes from fully declared earnings is a negligible part of <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> wealth .
Only if <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> eliminated unreported income would <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">the income tax</COREF> have an effect on rich people .
And if <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> <COREF ID="1__74" TYPE="IDENT">wants</COREF> *PRO*-1 to eliminate unreported income , to date there is no sign of <COREF ID="1__74" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , and there is no compelling evidence 0 *T*-2 to explain when <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> might eliminate unreported income *T*-3 .
Anyhow , it is not something 0 our generation will see *T*-1 .
That is why <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">the income tax</COREF> has no effect on *PRO* regulating the wealth of <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> rich people *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> does however have a highly restrictive effect on the ability *ICH*-1 of poor people *PRO* to get rich .
A very simple explanation is that <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">poor people</COREF> are all wage earners who *T*-1 rely on fully declared wages for <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> living ; <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not have unreported income .
Fully 100 % of <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> income falls within the income - tax field of vision , so <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ca n't escape even if <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to *?* .
*PRO* Add to this the fact that the threshold is under the level required * *PRO* to meet the necessary expenditures *PRO* to maintain the basic necessities of life , and the poor are completely stymied *-1 .
" Dragons give birth to dragons , phoenixes to phoenixes ; the son of a bandit will live in a cave . "
" The children of poor people are always poor . "
With <COREF ID="1__110" TYPE="IDENT">the previous 800 yuan income tax threshold</COREF> , if <COREF ID="1__110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> were strictly enforced *-1 , 80 % of beggars would have *-2 to pay .
With a threshold set *-1 below 5000 yuan , <COREF ID="1__132" TYPE="IDENT">this generation of poor people</COREF> need not think about *PRO*-2 buying a home or driving a car .
<COREF ID="1__132" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will always be poor .
Of course , many children of poor people <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">are</COREF> able *PRO*-1 to get rich , but <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> came about because <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">the parents</COREF> struggled harder , *PRO*-2 tightening <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> belts and " skimping on food and clothing " for <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> .
Now how many university students who *T*-1 have received acceptance notifications are *T*-2 unable *PRO*-3 to enroll , and how many enrolled university students from the countryside *T*-4 have parents who *T*-5 are living through unimaginably hard times ?
In <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">Western countries</COREF> , the personal income tax is the most effective means of *PRO* controlling excessively high incomes among the rich .
But <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> are countries ruled * by law , where official income is all recorded *-1 *T*-2 , citizen 's incomes are fully transparent , and therefore the personal income tax can easily achieve the effect of *PRO* regulating income distribution .
The situation in <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> is not like that ; if <COREF ID="2__31" TYPE="IDENT">the personal income tax</COREF> has <COREF ID="2__32" TYPE="IDENT">an effect</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's *PRO* to increase financial revenues , and <COREF ID="2__31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has absolutely no income - regulating effect .
3. *PRO* Eliminating the income tax will benefit peasants .
The vast majority of <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> 900 million peasants are unable *PRO*-1 to reach the income level for *PRO* paying income tax .
But <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">the peasants</COREF> have contractual land , <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have a low - consumption rural lifestyle and conditions , and <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have basic housing .
But if <COREF ID="2__50" TYPE="IDENT">people in the cities</COREF> do n't have money , everything is a struggle .
If <COREF ID="2__50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> go *PRO*-1 shopping for food by bike , <COREF ID="2__50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have *-2 to pay 20 cents for parking .
<COREF ID="2__50" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> ca n't not pay the rent or <COREF ID="2__50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll have *-1 to sleep on the street .
In terms of macroeconomic law , the distribution of wealth in Chinese society is set *-1 at 2/8 , with the 20 % of wealthy people holding 80 % of the social wealth , and the 80 % of poor people holding <COREF ID="2__77" TYPE="IDENT">just 20 % of the social wealth</COREF> .
The personal income tax threshold is too low , the urban population is too large , and the population participating in <COREF ID="2__77" TYPE="IDENT">the 20 % that *T*-1 goes to peasants</COREF> is even greater , so the peasants ultimately have *-2 to get a reduced share of <COREF ID="2__77" TYPE="IDENT">this 20 %</COREF> .
If we eliminate the personal income tax , the number of poor people in the cities will be reduced *-1 , and the people participating in the peasant struggle for <COREF ID="2__77" TYPE="IDENT">this 20 %</COREF> will be reduced *-2 , which *T*-3 will benefit the peasants .
In <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> the wealthy will always hold 80 % of the social wealth ; there has never been a softhearted rich person .

4. This will really be beneficial in *PRO* establishing a soft - landing market economy system .
In recent years <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">China 's</COREF> rate of state financial growth has <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">been</COREF> higher than economic growth ; <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a highly abnormal phenomenon , and in terms of economic theory <COREF ID="8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is highly adverse for sustained , healthy growth of the national economy .
The blood has all been pumped *-1 out of the national economy ; it 's like *PRO* eating up all the seeds sown * in the spring .
The proportion of financial revenues from <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the personal income tax</COREF> is <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">about 6 %</COREF> .
If we cancel out <COREF ID="23" TYPE="IDENT">this 6 %</COREF> , we can slow down financial growth .
And in the Chinese economic cycle , excessive financial investment is not a good thing for economic growth and the establishment of a true market economy system .
Compared to market investment , the efficiency of financial investment is less than half .
And when there is too much financial investment *T*-1 , corruption is everywhere , all the time .
5. It promotes the establishment of a harmonious society .
Chinese and foreign history amply demonstrates that a harmonious society is an olive - shaped society : the distribution of numbers of poor , middle - class and wealthy people making up the society is small at either end and larger in the middle , with 40 % or more of the society being middle class .
Chinese society is 80 % poor people , 20 % wealthy ; there is no stable middle class , or it floats between the lower levels of the wealthy and the upper end of the poor and is highly unstable .
There is no way 0 this " 2/8 " social structure can establish a harmonious society *T*-1 .
*PRO* Eliminating <COREF ID="22" TYPE="IDENT">the personal income tax</COREF> *PRO* to accumulate wealth for the people will be beneficial in *PRO* producing and nourishing a middle class and will promote the creation of a harmonious society .
In short , if our personal income tax policy can not help the poor get rich , and is unable *PRO*-1 to limit the excessive increase in wealth among the rich , then it *EXP*-2 is better *PRO* not to have this kind of personal income tax .
We need *-1 to adopt this kind of strategic insight when we consider this matter *T*-2 , so as *PRO* to benefit <COREF ID="5" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> and the people .
This essay is dedicated *-1 to all the hardworking people of the world .
