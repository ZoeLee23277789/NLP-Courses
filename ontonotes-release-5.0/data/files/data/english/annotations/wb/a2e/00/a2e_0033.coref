<COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">The most dangerous agreement that *T*-1 disinherits <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> from <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> oil resources</COREF> is being signed *-2 whilst <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">the world</COREF> is preoccupied *-3 with <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the execution of <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the Iraqi president</COREF> <COREF ID="1__16" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Saddam Hussein</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
The timing of the American administration 's decision *PRO* to <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">deliver</COREF> <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> to the gallows 0 *T*-1 to coincide with <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">the announcement by <COREF ID="1__26" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the deputy prime minister</COREF> <COREF ID="1__26" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Barham Salih</COREF> of the endorsement of <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">the new draft bill on oil resources</COREF></COREF> aroused interest .
<COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">The announcement</COREF> raised fears that <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the implementation of the death sentence</COREF> might be used *-1 *PRO* to cover the issue of oil at this time .
<COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">The draft of the law</COREF> was formulated *-1 in complete secrecy , away from Iraqi public opinion .
<COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">The draft</COREF> has been in the possession of <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">the American government</COREF> for some months according to what <COREF ID="1__47" TYPE="IDENT">the US Secretary of the Treasury</COREF> said *T*-1 during <COREF ID="1__47" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> visit to Baghdad last autumn .
Furthermore , the Baker - Hamilton report about US policy in <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> stressed that on *PRO* pressuring *PRO* to get <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">the new bill</COREF> issued *-1 .
It seems that the endorsement by <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">the US government</COREF> of <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">the draft bill on the exploitation of the Iraqi national oil resources</COREF> is much more important to <COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqi government</COREF> than *PRO* showing <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">the draft</COREF> to <COREF ID="1__66" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqi people</COREF> and having <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> debated *-1 by <COREF ID="1__66" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> independent organizations , <COREF ID="1__66" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> intellectuals , <COREF ID="1__66" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> professionals and the general public .
Unfortunately , <COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> is concerned with consultations behind the scenes with <COREF ID="1__80" TYPE="IDENT">the International Monetary Fund</COREF> and <COREF ID="-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the World Bank</COREF> and with the American advisers more than <COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is interested in *PRO*-1 bringing about the right climate inside <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> for exhaustive discussions ending with a calm decision in the interests of <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> .
If this climate was impossible in the light of <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">the Occupation</COREF> and the savage terrorism circumstances and in the light of the lack of <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> sovereignty , it *EXP*-2 would be wiser *PRO* to postpone the issuing of a new bill incompatible with the precepts of the national oil policy , which *T*-3 has been in existence for half a century , until a time when conditions are suitable for a serious debate and for a wide - scale public participation in the formulation of any serious decision 0 *T*-1 to be taken *-4 in this sphere *T*-5 .
However , <COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> seems *PRO*-2 subject to <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">the United States '</COREF> dictates that *T*-1 have expressed in various ways <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> insistence on handing over the Iraqi oil resources to foreign companies as one of the main aims of <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">the Occupation</COREF> .
The government of <COREF ID="1__127" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the previous prime minister</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__127" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ibrahim al - Jaafari</COREF> , made an undertaking *ICH*-1 to <COREF ID="1__80" TYPE="IDENT">the International Monetary Fund</COREF> *PRO* to issue a comprehensive law governing the exploitation of oil resources by the end of 2006 , in *PRO*-2 preparing for *PRO*-3 soliciting foreign corporate investment in the Iraqi oil industry with long - term contracts .
Exploration and Joint Production contracts adopted * by <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">the new draft bill</COREF> grant companies immunity from other national laws .
It *EXP*-1 is well - known that the law drafting peddled * by the international " houses of expertise " and organizations such as the <COREF ID="-E3" TYPE="IDENT">World Bank</COREF> market are usually loosely worded and weak , *PRO*-2 relegating details of the relationship to the sphere of *PRO* drawing up contracts between foreign companies on one hand and the government on the other as equal sides .
This takes us back to something like the framework of concessions which *T*-1 were abolished *-2 in different oil - producing countries by the nationalizations in the seventies with some important exceptions that *T*-3 relied on <COREF ID="2__33" TYPE="IDENT">the then government 's</COREF> negotiating ability .
This is what *T*-1 arouses worry at the time of Occupation and in the light of the general collapse , the prevalence of corruption and narrow interests , and in the light of the torn national unity .
The issuing of <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">the new oil bill</COREF> at the present time represents an introduction to the privatization of the main part of the national oil resources in accordance with <COREF ID="2__54" TYPE="IDENT">the conditions drawn * up by <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">the Occupation</COREF> and the International Monetary Fund</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is not in the interest of <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> *PRO* to submit to <COREF ID="2__54" TYPE="IDENT">these conditions</COREF> under threat and intimation of demands for <COREF ID="2__33" TYPE="IDENT">the former regime 's</COREF> debts .
<COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">The Occupation</COREF> has brought <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> nothing but destruction and corruption and <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is impossible 0 *PRO* to confront *T*-1 except by the strengthening the internal front and the position defending <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the nation 's</COREF> rights .

Much journalistic noise *ICH*-2 was <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">raised</COREF> *-1 abroad about <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the subject of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">the oil</COREF> and the distribution of <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> revenues</COREF> to the different areas of <COREF ID="1__8" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is a cause for caution , because <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the subject</COREF> is dealt with *-1 on the basis of sectarian or ethnic ownership of <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">the oil revenues</COREF> , at a time when the question of public participation in <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">the oil revenues</COREF> is a matter almost decided * in <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">the constitution</COREF> despite the deliberately obscure wording of <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> paragraphs *T*-2 .
It *EXP*-1 is clear that the agreement of the current regime forces occurred on the basis of general participation in the oil resources according to the proportion of the population in the regions .
<COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">Even the two Kurdish national parties</COREF> know that the greater part of the resources is situated *-1 in the South and that <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> guarantee of *PRO* obtaining a high level of the revenue will only happen through the sharing of Iraqi resources as a whole .
As such , the exclusion of an area or another is not the main question .
The fact is that the oil revenues are still passing through " The Iraq Development Fund " under the supervision of the United Nations and the United States in accordance with the Security Council resolutions and , consequently , any agreement between the central government and the regions about the distribution of oil revenues will be subject to the guarantee of the US hegemony .
The subject of oil from a sectarian or regional point of view was not presented *-1 except as a cover for <COREF ID="1__73" TYPE="IDENT">the important main questions about the oil policy</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__73" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> being Firstly : the abrogation of <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">Act 80 -LRB- 1961 -RRB-</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> cancellation , by *PRO* successively handing over <COREF ID="1__82" TYPE="IDENT">unexploited oilfields and areas</COREF> to foreign companies on the basis of long - term participation in production contracts , instead of *PRO* developing <COREF ID="1__82" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> nationally by *PRO* supporting the national oil companies and making use of foreign expertise through short - term service contracts that *T*-2 would leave the wealth in <COREF ID="1__8" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq 's</COREF> hands . Secondly : the weakening of <COREF ID="1__8" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraq 's</COREF> negotiating power by *PRO* weakening the centralization of contracting for the national resources with foreign companies and the instruments of such contracting ; *PRO* not distinguishing between the need *PRO* to expand the administrative powers of the companies and institutions on the one hand , and the need for the centralization of the major national economic decisions on the other .
It *EXP*-1 is illogical for the decision about a specific oilfield to be made *-2 centrally and the decision on another oilfield to be made *-3 locally , as this mixes jurisdictions and divides power solely at the expense of public interest .
The privatization of the oilfields and new oil areas weakens the currently existing national oil industry .
The issue is not <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">just that of the provision of <COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="IDENT">financial capabilities for investment in the national sector</COREF> or lack of <COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> , but extends beyond <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> to reliance on policies for *PRO* developing Iraqi technological and administrative capacities instead of relying on foreign companies .
<COREF ID="2__18" TYPE="IDENT">Technology</COREF> does not develop in isolation from the ability *PRO* to make decisions and in isolation from <COREF ID="2__18" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> relation with <COREF ID="2__25" TYPE="IDENT">society</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__25" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> institutions .
Foreign companies can come and go without <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">any advanced technology</COREF> establishing <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF> in <COREF ID="2__32" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> .
What *T*-1 is therefore needed *T*-1 is <COREF ID="2__33" TYPE="IDENT">a national oil industry , including a national private sector offering technical oil services</COREF> , and <COREF ID="2__33" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is what *T*-2 was not developed *-3 during the previous regime and what *T*-4 will hamper <COREF ID="2__33" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> as well is the reliance on foreign companies .
Fourthly : *PRO* achieving <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="IDENT">an integrated oil policy in regards to the exploitation of the national gas resources</COREF> and linking <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> with the production of electricity , oil refining , the development of different petrochemical industries , and industries reliant on intensive energy use .
On this basis , one must caution against companies that *T*-1 try *PRO*-2 to invest in the production of crude oil without *PRO*-3 being prepared *PRO*-4 to invest in the associated and complementary industries .
<COREF ID="2__32" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> suffered a lot from this situation before nationalization .
Fifthly : the crude oil production sector is not just that of the production fields , but that of facilities and complex production services and of cargo and transport services that *T*-1 require <COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT">a wide inter-governorate network in which different production units in <COREF ID="2__32" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> participate *T*-2</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> requires a national oil policy .
Practical experience shows that *PRO* following the market system in the sphere of <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">public facilities</COREF> is <COREF ID="2__a2e_0033.part-003.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">an extremely difficult administrative matter</COREF> and failure in <COREF ID="2__a2e_0033.part-003.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is almost certain .
It *EXP*-1 is better *PRO* to keep <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">these facilities</COREF> under public administration in all circumstances , and work *PRO* to develop the administrative capabilities .
<COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">A unified national policy</COREF> is an unavoidable necessity , and *PRO* regressing on <COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would compromise national interests .
Sixthly : *PRO* Break the relationship between oil and national economic development , because *PRO* bringing up the question of distribution equity on the basis of *PRO* dividing oil revenues among the regions in accordance with population ratios is a concept to a large extent incompatible with that of *PRO* exploiting oil resources for development .
The important thing is *PRO* to move towards investment in a way that *T*-1 will encourage the unemployed production capacities , and that *T*-2 will provide the necessary conditions for an effective , private national activity , not one that *T*-3 relies fully on deals and contracts with the government , whether local or central .
<COREF ID="2__118" TYPE="IDENT">This kind of developmental activity</COREF> can not be based *-1 in a single region or governorate ; instead <COREF ID="2__118" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> requires coordination in accordance with a general national program .
The important thing is not the equitable distribution of investment but the equitable and fair distribution of the benefits of the investment .
As we know *?* , most of <COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT">the financial investments made * by the Reconstruction Council</COREF> were in the northern region but the most significant impact of <COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> benefits was on other areas .
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="002">
This was also the case with many of the investments in the seventies , as the greatest part of the major oil and industrial projects , the oil projects and the ports are in the southern region .
Nevertheless , the benefits would have encompassed all if it was n't for the destruction that *T*-1 resulted from the wars started * by Saddam Hussein .
The most important thing then is integration and *PRO* striving *PRO*-1 to provide the minimum level of basic needs in terms of food , accommodation , education and health for all the citizens without discrimination .
It *EXP*-1 is unreasonable for us to seek solutions to the electricity problem for each governorate , or that we have local water policies in Mesopotamia .
Seventh : discussions are *-1 to be held *-2 about the cash distribution of part of the oil revenue ,
and this too will not lead to equity , nor to development and *PRO* attaining public interest .
It *EXP*-2 is well known *-1 that the notion of the individual cash share from oil revenues is an alternative to <COREF ID="1__49" TYPE="IDENT">the provisions ration</COREF> , and not a supplement to <COREF ID="1__49" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
On the other hand , the effect of <COREF ID="1__54" TYPE="IDENT">this change</COREF> on inflation and on the extent 0 the minimum level of basic needs would be provided *-1 for the poor sectors *T*-2 will be negative , and will have inherently harmful economic effects in the present period due to the lack of conditions for productive economic activity .
Also *PRO* making <COREF ID="1__54" TYPE="IDENT">this change</COREF> could provide an additional opportunity for corruption in implementation .
<COREF ID="1__69" TYPE="IDENT">The idea</COREF> is drawn *-1 from the experience of the US State of Alaska , and <COREF ID="1__69" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> means *PRO* moving away from public investments even in the vital sectors , as <COREF ID="1__69" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is an alternative to *PRO* providing electricity , water , health services and public education at affordable conditions and prices .
Finally , oil policy will be an important part of <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraqi national state</COREF> reconstruction and <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> rise from the present destruction .
The invitation *ICH*-3 is going out to all Iraqi patriots of various political and social hues who *T*-1 believe in <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">the current political process</COREF> and those who *T*-2 are outside <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and to the local and civil community in general , *PRO* to reject the idea of <COREF ID="1__100" TYPE="IDENT">a new oil bill being issued * at the present time</COREF> and for <COREF ID="1__100" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> to be postponed *-4 for at least a full year *PRO* to start the debate about the future of the oil policy that *T*-5 stresses peace and the ending of the occupation as the basic requirements for a national oil policy .
As for *PRO* bringing up hopes of speedy prosperity by *PRO* accelerating production *PRO* using <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">foreign companies</COREF> , that is a mirage as <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the companies</COREF> will not come except under favorably secure conditions .
Also , the main economic problems in <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> currently do not lie in the diminished oil revenue , but in the occupation , the security situation , the widespread corruption and theft , the dissolution of <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> , the loss of the oil resources and the breakdown of economic activity .
How similar *ICH*-1 is present *T*-2 to the past .
The responsibility lies in particular on the shoulders of <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT">the members of the current National Assembly</COREF> , notwithstanding <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> loyalties , and <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> must ask <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> : if the Kuwaiti National Council has been opposing for years the foreign oil investment project in Kuwait , and if <COREF ID="2__35" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi Arabia and Iran</COREF> are still holding to the nationalization of oil in <COREF ID="2__35" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> countries , are <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> ready *PRO*-1 to revoke Act No. 80 ?
<COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="1st_top">1st_top</COREF>
<COREF ID="2__46" TYPE="IDENT">75 % of Iraqi oil to foreign companies and 25 % to Iraqis .</COREF>
<COREF ID="2__46" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is what <COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">the Americans</COREF> want *T*-1 and after <COREF ID="2__46" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> <COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> destroy what *ICH*-3 *T*-2 remains of <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="1st_top">My</COREF> greetings .
