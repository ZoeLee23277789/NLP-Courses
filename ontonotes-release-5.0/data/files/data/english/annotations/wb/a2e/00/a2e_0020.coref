This unprecedented Arab and international interest in <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">the execution of <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Iraqi President Saddam Hussein</COREF></COREF> and the barbaric way in which <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was carried *-1 out *T*-2 , confirms the importance of <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> prominent status , and <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> distinguished role in the history of the Arab region .
<COREF ID="1__a2e_0020.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">The American administration , who *T*-1 planned carefully for <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">this event</COREF> through experts in media and public relations , and <COREF ID="1__a2e_0020.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> tools in <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> and the inclinations of public opinion</COREF> did not at all expect such an opposite result , which *T*-3 along with the destructive consequences that *T*-2 may result from <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in the coming days have caught <COREF ID="1__a2e_0020.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> by surprise .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> proceeded to the gallows like a proud mountain , with head raised *-1 , *PRO*-2 standing upright , *PRO*-2 looking down at the insignificant things and insignificant people , *PRO*-2 believing in <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> creed and <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> Arabism , *PRO*-2 repeating slogans of pride and dignity , after <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> confirmed <COREF ID="1__54" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> faith</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> confirmed <COREF ID="1__54" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> by *PRO*-1 repeating verses from the noble Koran and the two testimonies .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> will be envied *-1 by all Arab leaders , both living and dead , for this honorable martyrdom , and this enormous love in the midst of hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims all over the different parts of the world .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> was the only leader in the modern history of <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">this nation</COREF> who *T*-1 went to the guillotine because <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was a patriot who *T*-2 refused occupation and surrender to the invasion , and chose resistance .
The only ones who *T*-1 preceded <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in this honor were men like Umar al - Mukhtar and Yusuf al - Azma , by whose struggle <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> history were honored *-2 *T*-3 , and kept it for them in the records of pride and dignity .
<COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> hastily executed <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> because <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> feared <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> even when <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was behind bars *T*-1 , just as <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will still fear <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> as a corpse hidden *-2 under the soil of <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">the homeland</COREF> , and comparisons between <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> time and <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bloody and chaotic time always came in <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> favor , and the calls for <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> return *PRO* to save <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> from <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> crisis and the corrupt and malicious gang that *T*-3 governs <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> have become deafening to the ears of <COREF ID="1__127" TYPE="IDENT">the occupation</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__127" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> accomplices .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> embarrassed <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and dwarfed <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> by *PRO*-1 standing as a spear in the prisoner 's dock .
<COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were terrified *-1 by the penetrating looks of <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> eyes .
<COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were exposed *-1 by <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> patriotism and Arabism and <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> contempt for the odious sectarian divisions that <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> planted *T*-2 in <COREF ID="1__151" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> contaminated new Iraq</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> decided *PRO*-1 to get *PRO*-1 rid *-2 of <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> with a confused and embarrassing hastiness .
Thanks to the technology of the mobile phone which *T*-1 enabled us *PRO*-2 to recognize the ugly face of the hateful sectarianism that *T*-3 is governing in <COREF ID="1__151" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">America 's</COREF> Iraq</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">This tape</COREF> exposed the government of the Green Zone , and blew up all the plans for censorship and fraud by the experts of <COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="IDENT">the American Intelligence service</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> agents .
<COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">presented</COREF> us with the naked truth , without <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> being the intention of <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> owner .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was right when <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> turned to <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and said , " Are <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> men ? " when <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were directing insults at <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> while <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was proceeding to the gallows in magnanimity and with self - respect , *PRO*-1 repeating the noble words *T*-2 *T*-3 , " and when the ignorant address <COREF ID="2__32" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-4 <COREF ID="2__32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> say ' peace . ' "
Is it *EXP*-1 manliness *PRO* to shout hateful sectarian slogans in front of <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">a man who *T*-2 has never been sectarian</COREF> , and the rope of the gallows is being wound *-3 around <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> neck , and <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> soul</COREF> will go to <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> Creator</COREF> in a few seconds ?
Are these the tolerant ethics of Islam ?
Are these the values of Arabism , decency , and pride ?
Are those the sons of <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">the great Iraq which *T*-1 had always stood up against invaders throughout history and was a pillar of support for <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">its nation</COREF> and the causes of justice in the world as a whole</COREF> ?
We are sorry , but not surprised , because some Arab governments objected only because <COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT">the execution</COREF> took place on the day of the feast of Bairam , as if <COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT">the execution of <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">this man</COREF></COREF> would have been permissible and blessed on any other day .
We are sorry again because <COREF ID="2__81" TYPE="IDENT">most of <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">the Arab leaders</COREF></COREF> hid in <COREF ID="2__81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> palaces and none of <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> dared *PRO*-1 to speak even one word of protest out of fear of <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> .
We were stabbed *-1 twice , first when we watched <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">an Arab leader</COREF> being led *-2 to the gallows in accordance with sectarian justice which *T*-3 is spiteful and vengeful *T*-4 . And the second time when we did not see anyone among the club of leaders to which <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> belonged *T*-5 for more than 30 years object to <COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> execution</COREF> *T*-6 .
Maybe <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> wanted a good end for <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> , and a good reputation , when <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> induced one of them *PRO*-1 to record what <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> and the government of sects wanted *PRO*-2 to hide *T*-3 , by means of <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">the video of the last moments , which *T*-4 created a historic turning point that *T*-5 will perhaps shape the history of <COREF ID="2__124" TYPE="IDENT">the region</COREF> , and the nature of events in <COREF ID="2__124" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> for decades 0 *T*-6 to come</COREF> *T*-7 .
Maybe <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to expose the series of lies of <COREF ID="2__133" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Muwaffaq al - Rabi</COREF> <COREF ID="2__133" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB" E_OFF="1">the National Security Advisor in the government of occupation . -LRB- Where is that security *T*-2 ? -RRB-</COREF> , who *T*-3 went out to the world *PRO*-4 saying that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> , *PRO* meaning <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">President Saddam</COREF> , was weak and collapsing while <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was on <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> way *PRO* to meet <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> God</COREF> .
Then <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">the tape</COREF> comes along and shows us with sound and image that we are in front of <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">a courageous lion , who *T*-1 refuses *PRO*-2 to wear the mask , just as <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> refused *PRO*-3 to take the tranquilizing pills 0 they offered <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *T*-4</COREF> .

Why <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the mask</COREF> , and why <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the pills</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">The mask</COREF> is for <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">traitors and criminals who *T*-1 are ashamed of <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> treason or <COREF ID="4" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> crimes</COREF> , and <COREF ID="2" TYPE="IDENT">the tranquilizing pills</COREF> are appropriate for <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-2 can not face history because of <COREF ID="9" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> bad deeds</COREF> .
<COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">The American administration</COREF> committed a fatal mistake and revealed a major foolishness 0 *T*-1 to be added *-2 to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> many foolishnesses in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> when <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">executed</COREF> <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">this man</COREF> *T*-3 , in a way for which <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will pay a hefty price in the near future *T*-4 .
<COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> survival</COREF> would have benefited <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> much more than <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> execution</COREF> if <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> understood politics as <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should *?* , because <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> survival</COREF> could have been a card 0 *T*-1 to threaten <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">the sectarians</COREF> and keep <COREF ID="35" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> as servants to <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> schemes , just as <COREF ID="27" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could have been a bargaining chip for *PRO* calming down <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">the resistance</COREF> and the broad Iraqi sector which *T*-2 supports <COREF ID="44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not know anything except grudges , and <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not want anything other than *PRO* inflicting more degradation on the Arabs and Muslims by <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> execution</COREF> .
Perhaps <COREF ID="15" TYPE="IDENT">the American administration</COREF> will have succeeded in one thing only *ICH*-1 , intentionally and with <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">planning</COREF> or without <COREF ID="62" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , namely , *PRO* deepening the sectarian breach not only in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> but in the Islamic world as a whole .
It was not by coincidence that Nouri al - Maliki signed the decision *PRO* to carry out <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">the execution</COREF> *T*-1 .
And it *EXP*-1 was also not a matter of coincidence that the task of *PRO* carrying <COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> out was assigned *-2 to spiteful sectarians as we have seen *?* in the videotape .
Al - Talabani *ICH*-1 hid or fled , along with all those who *T*-2 participated in the project of <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">the American occupation</COREF> and gave <COREF ID="84" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> a legitimate cover , from the other sect .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">This execution</COREF> will deal a strong blow to all the efforts of national reconciliation .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> will lead to the escalation of attacks against <COREF ID="a2e_0020.part-002.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the American forces</COREF> and those cooperating with <COREF ID="a2e_0020.part-002.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="29" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> will pour more oil on the fire of the civil war that *T*-1 has already been kindled *-2 .
<COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">Those who *T*-1 carried out the death sentence</COREF> do not want reconciliation or to maintain a unified Iraq .
Rather , <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are working *PRO*-1 to blow <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up ; tolerance , forgiveness , and patience are basic characteristics not found * in <COREF ID="103" TYPE="IDENT">those people</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> had negative traits and positive traits , but <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was not killed *-1 because of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> negative traits , but rather because of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> positive traits , which *T*-2 were <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> belief in Arab unity , resistance to the enemies of <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">the nation</COREF> , *PRO* building an unprecedented industrial and educational foundation , and *PRO* challenging <COREF ID="a2e_0020.part-002.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> chose resistance and rejected safe and luxurious exile .
The curse of <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> will continue *-1 to chase <COREF ID="a2e_0020.part-002.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , chase <COREF ID="a2e_0020.part-002.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">the Americans</COREF> , and chase <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> spiteful sectarian executioners .
Just as Al - Qaeda emerged from the womb of Israeli arrogance in Lebanon and American arrogance in <COREF ID="19" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> , <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam 's</COREF> Al - Qaeda will emerge from the womb of the degrading execution process .
