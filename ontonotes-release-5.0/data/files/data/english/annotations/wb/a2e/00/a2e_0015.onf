    We said :-LRB-The results contradicted the facts of the proceedings. We were not informed until just now of the
    committee's final decision. What is needed is to halt the decision of dismissal, especially since it is based on your
    instruction, until we are given a copy of the committee's decision so we can respond to it.-RRB-
