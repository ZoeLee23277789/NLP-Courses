As a courtesy , not an order , please place in the political forum this picture , which goes back to <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">1973 - 1393</ENAMEX> , at the time of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">King Faisal</ENAMEX> , may God have mercy on him , when he prevented the export of oil to <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> .

Things <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">today</ENAMEX> are more complicated than before ...
and the lurkers for us are many ...
Also , the world today has become uni-polar ... as they say !
I wish things would stay like that ... but leave it to God ...
God shall decide .

Question : I would like to ask His Highness <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Saud</ENAMEX> whether <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> is ready to raise its production of oil , in case the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> crisis causes a reduction of the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> production or a rise in prices ?
In other words , is <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> ready to use the oil weapon against the oil weapon ?
I would also like to ask with regard to the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> crisis , what is the significance of the initiatives that the group of nations , of which <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> is part , I mean , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gulf Cooperation Council</ENAMEX> , are undertaking in order to develop the project of the nuclear program ?
Is this , I mean , the preparation a group of <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Sunni</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Arab</ENAMEX> countries are undertaking as a warning directed at the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Iranian</ENAMEX> leadership ?
Your Highness , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Minister</ENAMEX> : We are -LSB- handling -RSB- the issue of facing the oil weapon with the oil weapon , because we do not consider it an oil weapon .
It is wealth to be used , and we are using this wealth in consideration of our national interests , the interests of the producing nations , and the interests of the consuming nations .
His Highness <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">the Oil Minister</ENAMEX> has very clearly clarified that the policy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> is established on balance in the oil market .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> has historically proven that in times of crisis , it does what it should do as the biggest producer of oil , in a way that guarantees the stability of the oil markets .
As for the nuclear program which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Gulf Cooperation Council</ENAMEX> has approved , I believe that among the most important reasons on which the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Council</ENAMEX> agreed in this framework is to enter in this important industry , the importance of which not only includes a military aspect , but also a peaceful aspect , in order to establish an industry subject to strict controls that can not be violated , in order to guarantee its peaceful direction .
And it may be an example for all who want to have this industry and have no intention of developing it , other than establishing nuclear weapons .
This is the goal the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Gulf Cooperation Council</ENAMEX> countries are seeking .

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Maghaweer</ENAMEX> and brother , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abu Dalama</ENAMEX> : Thank you for participating and expressing your opinion .
And I -LSB- agree with -RSB- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Prince Faisal</ENAMEX> , that it is essential to consider the interests of the nation and the interests of development in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Kingdom</ENAMEX> , but I enclosed the picture per the request of its owner .

No doubt the political reading today differs from the situations in which the decision was made at that time .
The political situation of the world today has even become more complicated than before .
It ca n't be said that any oil producing country can use oil as a weapon to impose a certain political vision or political position .
It may be one of the most important reasons that the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> presence in the region today has become a fact with which we have to live , not to face with any weapon .

It is very hard today to use oil as a weapon .
We will suffer more than the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> in my belief .
And God -LSB- knows better -RSB- .
