Students at schools of <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">the Qisrin settlement</COREF> found <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the pendant of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">a Syrian soldier</COREF></COREF> south of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the occupied Syrian Golan</COREF> .
On <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the pendant</COREF> was written *-1 *T*-2 the name of <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the soldier</COREF> , <COREF ID="19" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Mahmoud bin Ali</COREF></COREF> , and <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="22" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> military serial number</COREF> <COREF ID="22" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">M 16241</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was a Muslim , and <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> blood type was A+ .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">The two students</COREF> , <COREF ID="31" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Alexander Ghuliyandrin and Oleg Darutsigh</COREF></COREF> , said that <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were on a trip last Saturday morning when <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> reached <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">a military fortification near <COREF ID="11" TYPE="IDENT">Qisrin</COREF></COREF> *T*-1 .
It *EXP*-1 was obvious that man 's foot had not stepped on <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">this place</COREF> for a long time ago .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">The two students</COREF> entered <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the fortification where <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> found old medical equipment and a number of military helmets and a canteen , as well as <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">a military pendant covered * with mud and very dirty</COREF> *T*-1</COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">The two students</COREF> took <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the pendant</COREF> home with <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and cleaned <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and washed <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were surprised that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did not belong to an Israeli soldier because the writing on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was in Arabic and <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> did not understand anything that *T*-1 was written *-2 on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">The two students</COREF> took <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the pendant</COREF> with <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to school on Sunday and tried *PRO*-1 to consult the teacher *PRO*-2 to find out what *T*-3 was written *-4 on <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
It turned out that <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> belonged to <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">a Syrian soldier whose name *T*-1 was Mahmoud bin Ali</COREF> .
<COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> military serial number</COREF> was 16241 , and the writing also indicated that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was a Muslim and <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> blood type was A+ .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">A senior officer in the Israeli army who *T*-1 fought in <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Golan</COREF> during <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the June War</COREF> as well as in <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the October War</COREF></COREF> , said that from the descriptions of <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the place</COREF> and <COREF ID="47" TYPE="IDENT">the fortification</COREF></COREF> given * by <COREF ID="30" TYPE="IDENT">the two boys</COREF> , <COREF ID="96" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> go back to <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">the war of June 1967</COREF> , because the Syrian army did not establish fortifications south of <COREF ID="3" TYPE="IDENT">the Golan</COREF> during <COREF ID="94" TYPE="IDENT">the October War</COREF> .
<COREF ID="90" TYPE="IDENT">The officer</COREF> added that the presence of <COREF ID="1" TYPE="IDENT">the pendant</COREF> in <COREF ID="39" TYPE="IDENT">the place</COREF> together with medicines and medical equipment indicates that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">the soldier</COREF> was injured *-1 , and it is probable that <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> fate is still unknown to <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> family and relatives and no one knows what *T*-2 happened to <COREF ID="24" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
The strange thing is that the Arab and Syrian media are kept *-1 *PRO*-2 oblivious of these news stories which *T*-3 are concerned *-4 with the prisoners and soldiers lost * in <COREF ID="93" TYPE="IDENT">that war</COREF> .
