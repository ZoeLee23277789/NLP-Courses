    I think, in my opinion, that if democracy in some of the neighboring countries is non-existent in the simplest matters

    this huge number of intellectuals, politicians, and heads of state to discuss sensitive issues that concern the Arab
    World ?

    So... imposing censorship and certain regulations on the work of educational and media institutions is not a matter for
    censure or a sign of backwardness... rather it might be a necessary and urgent requirement... especially if those in
    charge of theses institutions are non-Muslims.. or if the ones exposed are our younger generation and the treasures of
    our nation !!.
