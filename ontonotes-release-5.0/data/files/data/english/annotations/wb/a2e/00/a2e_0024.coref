The total costs of <COREF ID="1__24" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="1__34" TYPE="IDENT">Jeddah</COREF> project</COREF> is expected *-1 to amount to approximately 50 billion riyals and will turn the map of <COREF ID="1__34" TYPE="IDENT">the town</COREF> upside down .

<COREF ID="1__90" TYPE="IDENT">That collapse *ICH*-2</COREF> was expected *-1 , not to mention the speculation that *T*-3 occurred .
With the revival of the petro-market and the increase in <COREF ID="-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom 's</COREF> revenue , both of the government or the citizens , there was a lot of money and limited investment opportunities ,
so inflation *ICH*-1 occurred , leading to <COREF ID="1__90" TYPE="IDENT">the collapse</COREF> and not a single Saudi family escaped *PRO*-2 being hit *-3 .
Even in the current market situation , if we compare to the Price Earning Ratio then it is still logical and realistic ,
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> pointed out that current share prices were logical and reasonable . and demanded 0 investors stop *-1 <COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="IDENT">speculating</COREF> because <COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> leads to many bankruptcies .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> said that there are companies on the market in which profit potential was nonexistent *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> applauded <COREF ID="2__16" TYPE="IDENT">the decision *ICH*-1 of the Capital Market Authority *PRO* to suspend dealings of the two companies</COREF> and said that <COREF ID="2__16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was a wise decision but <COREF ID="2__16" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had come too late as there were fears from speculators of *PRO* suspending the shares of other companies , and <COREF ID="2__28" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> *ICH*-2 is one of <COREF ID="-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> rights , *PRO* to <COREF ID="2__28" TYPE="IDENT">suspend</COREF> dealing in the shares of companies that *T*-3 were hopeless .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> indicated that there might be other companies whose shares *T*-1 will be suspended *-2 and that investors should buy into companies that , it *EXP*-5 was hoped *-3 , 0 *T*-4 would remain and continue .
*PRO*-1 Speaking of the timing of <COREF ID="2__43" TYPE="IDENT">this announcement</COREF> and the reasons for <COREF ID="2__43" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">Prince Al - Waleed</COREF> said that the undertaking *PRO* to pump 10 billion riyals into the Saudi market was made *-2 last March and that the investment 0 <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had undertaken *T*-3 was not completed *-4 till two weeks ago and therefore it was being announced *-5 .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> hoped that <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> had hit the bottom but without any mad rises as *?* had happened in the past , as they were short - term paper profits .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> expected that the current year would witness the restoration of equilibrium to <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi market</COREF> after *PRO* reaching a kind of sensibility .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> explained that <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi authorities</COREF> were insistent on *PRO* driving out the speculators who *T*-1 were pushing <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> into *PRO* harming <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and the small investors .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> pointed out that <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> is looking for a bottom 0 *PRO* to hit *T*-1 thereafter *PRO* to be able *PRO*-2 to rise in a logical and reasonable way
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> indicated that <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> was looking for a bottom at 7000 points or slightly less .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> added : " We do not want <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi stock market</COREF> to return to insane and unacceptable figures as <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did in the past <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom Holding Company</COREF> is investing in <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> *PRO* to restore confidence in <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .

<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Prince Al - Waleed</COREF> confirmed that <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom Holding Company</COREF> is continuing with <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> plans *PRO* to list for sale a percentage of <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> shares agreed upon * with <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> , to reach a figure that *T*-1 serves the Saudi citizen and does not harm the future interests of <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the Company</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> expansions .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> stressed that even in the current market conditions <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> would be listing <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> shares on <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> in the current year .
*PRO*-1 Speaking of the downturn on <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> in light of the increasing petroleum revenues and the record budget achieved * by <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> during the last two financial years , <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Prince Al - Waleed</COREF> said that <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> is a mirror of <COREF ID="2__51" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi economy</COREF> . but if <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> was exaggerated *-2 then there would be a difference between the state of the Saudi market in general and the stock market and this is what *T*-3 happened .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> offered a number of suggestions *ICH*-1 to the Ministry of Finance and officials *PRO* to help the companies , namely : *PRO* to allow <COREF ID="1__54" TYPE="IDENT">companies</COREF> to buy <COREF ID="1__54" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> shares immediately which *T*-2 would give trust in <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> and would reduce the number of dealt in shares on <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> and thus increase the amount of profit ; *PRO* to allow non-Saudi companies and corporations to enter <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> by *PRO* placing controls such as *PRO* instituting sectors for shares and an ownership percentage ceiling ; and *PRO* to oblige <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">companies</COREF> *PRO*-3 to disclose future expectations of <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">the companies '</COREF> performances .
A discussion with <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">the CEOs of <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi companies</COREF></COREF> has been initiated *-1 by <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom Holding Company</COREF> by *PRO* sending <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> letters dealing with the disclosure of <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">the companies '</COREF> future expectations .
This is done *-1 by all companies in the developed world with the aim of *PRO* obliging the company *PRO*-2 to achieve <COREF ID="1__90" TYPE="IDENT">the declared profit</COREF> or something close to <COREF ID="1__90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and *PRO* to re-assure the investor .
Finally , more disclosures between the company and the investor , since there are <COREF ID="1__99" TYPE="IDENT">companies with specific profit achieving strategies not from <COREF ID="1__99" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> basic accredited activities , such as *PRO* achieving non-repeatable profit</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> added : " We wish *PRO*-1 to remove <COREF ID="1__106" TYPE="IDENT">the weak companies that *T*-2 do not represent the Saudi economy</COREF> from <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> and separate <COREF ID="1__106" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> from the companies with big profits . "
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> confirmed that these proposals would be made *-1 to state officials *PRO* to be applied *-2 to companies .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Prince Al - Waleed</COREF> denied that <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom Holding Company</COREF> had liquidized any portfolio 0 <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had *T*-1 in <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom</COREF> ,
but on the contrary , <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> had increased <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> investments in a number of companies , and in addition did not enter into any speculation at all but is working on *PRO* buying and keeping for investment .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also denied that <COREF ID="1__131" TYPE="IDENT">the collapse of last February</COREF> was planned *-1 by any party , but <COREF ID="1__131" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> rather occurred because of the illogical prices reached * by <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> indicated that <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">the collapse</COREF> was expected *-1 because of the inflation in share prices and said that any person familiar with <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market</COREF> will confirm that <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">the collapse</COREF> was imminent at that time .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> explained that <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> could not in any way be made *-1 responsible for <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">the losses of investors on <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF></COREF> and must remain neutral on <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
The role of <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> is *PRO*-1 to prevent <COREF ID="2__18" TYPE="IDENT">the manipulators</COREF> from *PRO*-2 exposing <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> to fluctuations , to punish <COREF ID="2__18" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and to suspend bankrupt companies .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> pointed out that there is a study on *PRO* dividing <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> because it *EXP*-1 was difficult *PRO* to place profitable , strong companies alongside weak loss - making ones , and this is where the Capital Market Authority plays a role *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> called upon <COREF ID="2__34" TYPE="IDENT">the investors and not the experience lacking speculators in <COREF ID="1__21" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF></COREF> , *PRO*-1 to go to investment funds and banks *PRO*-2 to invest <COREF ID="2__34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> finances in a professional manner , so as *PRO* to avoid *PRO*-3 getting caught *-4 in market fluctuations and become exposed *-4 to losses .
As for <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT">the stagnation in <COREF ID="2__51" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi economy</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not probable , because last year and at the peak of <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">the stock market collapse</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__51" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi economy</COREF> flourished and achieved a 6 per cent growth , because there is a difference in the course of <COREF ID="2__51" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi economy</COREF> and that of the stock market .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> asserted that expectations indicate 0 there will be no stagnation in <COREF ID="2__51" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi economy</COREF> during the current year due to <COREF ID="2__51" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> strength , especially in the light of the serious strong steps taken * by <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the government</COREF> *PRO* to not to concentrate on the petroleum factor .
*PRO*-1 Regarding <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> competition for <COREF ID="2__74" TYPE="IDENT">the third license *PRO* to operate cell phones in <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said that <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> have an alliance with the Turkish Turkcell Company *PRO* to compete for <COREF ID="2__74" TYPE="IDENT">this license</COREF> , and as *PRO* regards the license for fixed phones , <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> will not enter into such competition .
Regarding the investment in the Bank of China , <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Prince Al - Waleed</COREF> said that <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> had applied *PRO*-1 to invest as a representative of the Arab world and the Middle East , based on a request made * by the Chinese authorities .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> pointed out that <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> requested an investment of two billion dollars but had allocated only 300 million dollars for <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> and the deal went through .
The profits gained * from *PRO* listing <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the company 's</COREF> shares amounted to about 25 per cent .

There is a number of questions whose answers *T*-1 would let us know what the course of <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> will be *T*-2 ?
Is <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Al - Waleed 's</COREF> view with <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> team of analysts and consultants that these sinking levels might form a bottom to <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> ?
Do these growing profits and collapsing prices form an historic opportunity for investment ?

We are picking the condemnations of <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Al - Waleed</COREF> from the news which <COREF ID="1__57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the writer</COREF> <COREF ID="1__57" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">JARIR</COREF> has added *T*-1 and providing a commentary in red .
through the increase of investment in <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">the Samba Financial Group</COREF> *PRO* to make <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> share larger than 5 percent ; the industrial sector through the increase in investment in the National Industrialization Company *PRO* to increase the share of <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom Holding Company</COREF> to more than 10 percent ; and the food production sector through the increase in investment in <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">the Safola Company</COREF> *PRO* to make <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> share larger than 13 percent ; and the media sector through a new investment in <COREF ID="1__81" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi Research and Publishing company</COREF> of a more than 25 percent share in <COREF ID="1__81" TYPE="IDENT">the company</COREF> , in addition to the investment in a number of companies that *T*-1 will soon be publicly listed *-2 on <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi stock market</COREF> , such as the Mid Gulf company in the insurance sector .
During a press conference held * be <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> yesterday at the Riyadh headquarters of <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom Holding Company</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Prince Al - Waleed</COREF> explained that <COREF ID="1__99" TYPE="IDENT">pumping of <COREF ID="1__100" TYPE="IDENT">this money</COREF></COREF> had taken more time than *PRO* anticipated *-1 . but confirmed that <COREF ID="1__100" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was not for speculation but rather for investment .
the relevant state authorities have been informed *-1 of these investments in pursuance of the principle of transparency being used * .
Months ago <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Al - Waleed</COREF> declared <COREF ID="1__99" TYPE="IDENT">the pumping of ten billion riyals</COREF> and specified companies that *T*-1 were " respectable " according to <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> claim .
<COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> won the confidence of some and <COREF ID="1__119" TYPE="IDENT">small speculators</COREF> entered <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> , whereupon an artificial surge occurred *T*-1 , then <COREF ID="1__119" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were caught *-2 in the collapses which *T*-3 followed that made - up surge and which *T*-4 have continued until today .
<COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Al - Waleed</COREF> had lost <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> credibility on <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had *-1 to change <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> rhetoric if <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wanted *PRO*-2 to restore <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> credibility in order *PRO* to continue <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mission of *PRO* beating <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> -LRB- as some believe *?* -RRB- .
Thus <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had *-1 to specify in <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> present statement , in addition to the names of the companies , the percentage 0 <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> owns *T*-2 in each company -LRB- more than 5 % in <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">Samba</COREF> , more than 10 % in Manufacturing , more than 13 % in <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">Safola</COREF> , more than 25 % in Research , ... etc. -RRB-
*PRO*-1 Speaking of the timing of <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT">this announcement</COREF> and the reasons for <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Prince Al - Waleed</COREF> said that the undertaking *PRO* to pump 10 billion riyals into <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi market</COREF> was made *-2 last March . and that <COREF ID="2__31" TYPE="IDENT">the investment 0 <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had undertaken *T*-3</COREF> was not completed *-4 till two weeks ago and therefore <COREF ID="2__31" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was being announced *-5 .
It *EXP*-1 is not possible *PRO* to believe that <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Al - Waleed</COREF> had been " only " <COREF ID="2__39" TYPE="IDENT">collecting</COREF> since last March -LRB- almost a year ago -RRB- until now . Because , if <COREF ID="2__39" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> had happened , then the rates of <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> prices would be much higher than the current prices .
This would be unreasonable behavior from an opportunist like <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Al - Waleed</COREF> .
And so this explanation of <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> is untruthful .
" <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> expected that the current year would witness the restoration of equilibrium to <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi market</COREF> after *PRO* reaching a kind of sensibility . "
<COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">This expression</COREF> seems *-1 to have two sides to <COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> :
the first is *PRO* to send a signal *ICH*-1 to <COREF ID="2__62" TYPE="IDENT">the Market Authority</COREF> that <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> does not want *PRO*-2 to create a very strong imaginary surge
and this might mean that <COREF ID="2__62" TYPE="IDENT">the Market Authority</COREF> is being informed *-3 that <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will be satisfied with less profit than <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> -LRB- counterpart -RRB- and then get out .
The second : *PRO* to win <COREF ID="2__73" TYPE="IDENT">the dealers '</COREF> belief that <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> might have hit the bottom and that <COREF ID="2__73" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should safely enter with <COREF ID="2__73" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cash and begin *-1 raising <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> index .
" <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> explained that the Saudi authorities were insistent on *PRO* driving out the speculators who *T*-1 were pushing <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> into *PRO* harming <COREF ID="2__73" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> and the small investors . "
In this clause of the statement <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is assuring the minds of <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">dealers</COREF> that *PRO* does not intend *PRO*-1 to dispose of <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> shares to <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> through this action of <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> , and so <COREF ID="2__92" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> should enter and raise up the index of <COREF ID="2__116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> companies</COREF> .
" <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">the Kingdom Holding Company</COREF> is investing in <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">the market</COREF> *PRO* to restore confidence in <COREF ID="2__29" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> . "
And " more importantly , the investor must be educated *-1 *PRO*-2 to invest in companies that *T*-3 have a good future . "
Here <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Al - Waleed</COREF> confirms sowing of trust in the hearts of <COREF ID="2__113" TYPE="IDENT">speculators</COREF> but only if <COREF ID="2__113" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> enter and give a boost to <COREF ID="2__116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> companies</COREF> .
That 's why <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> finished by *PRO*-1 saying " educating the investor *T*-2 "
It is the pinnacle of education when the speculators enter into <COREF ID="2__116" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Al - Waleed 's</COREF> companies</COREF> and get stuck *T*-1 , since the blow might be final .
