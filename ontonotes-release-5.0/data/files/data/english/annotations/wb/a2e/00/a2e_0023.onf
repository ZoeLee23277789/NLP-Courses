Plain sentence:

    Since I think that publishing the statements made by athletes, actors, and singers is one way to help us to serve this
    cause, and since these interviews came through the newspaper Al-Jazirah, I think that if they had been published by the
    newspaper Al-Watan or Al-Riyadh they would have stopped this question from being asked to the guest because they are
    known for their banning of the other and they do not know neutrality when exposing and they do not like these answers.
    As it happened with the newspaper Al-Riyadh when it halted and concealed the poll on women driving as it saw the
    overwhelming victory of those opposed.
