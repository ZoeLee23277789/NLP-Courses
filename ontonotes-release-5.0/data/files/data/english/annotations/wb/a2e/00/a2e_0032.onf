    are the inventers of chess, the game of the smart, the witty, and the strategic planners.

    We all know that Iran can just hint to Abd Al Aziz Al Hakim, who wanted to compensate it with a hundred billion dollars
    from the aliment of the Iraqi people for its war with Iraq, or to the fascist militia leaders like the Sadr militia,
    which implemented the execution judgment with the recognition of the Iraqi government, to postpone the hanging,
    especially as the Americans had confirmed that they were against the execution on the holy day.

    but if Iran does not really want to inflame grudges between the Shiites and the Sunnis and seeks to unite the Islamic
    front and prevent its penetration on the part of the Zionists and Americans, as it claims, why did it give the green
    light to its agents and militias in Iraq to execute Saddam Hussein on Eid Al Adha and provide justifications on a golden
    plate for those who want to break down Muslims on a sectarian basis ?
