Plain sentence:
---------------
    I say this because displaying the photos of the female cheerleaders whether they are Saudis or hired, and anything is

Treebanked sentence:
--------------------
    I say this because *PRO* displaying the photos of the female cheerleaders whether they are Saudis or hired *-1 , and
    anything is possible , though the latter is more likely , does not make us think that all are respectable .
