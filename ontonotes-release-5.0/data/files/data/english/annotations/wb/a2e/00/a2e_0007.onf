    As for the nuclear program which the Gulf Cooperation Council has approved, I believe that among the most important
    reasons on which the Council agreed in this framework is to enter in this important industry, the importance of which
    not only includes a military aspect, but also a peaceful aspect, in order to establish an industry subject to strict
    controls that can not be violated, in order to guarantee its peaceful direction.
