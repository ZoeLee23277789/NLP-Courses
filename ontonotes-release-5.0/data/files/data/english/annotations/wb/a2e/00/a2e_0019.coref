<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam 's</COREF> last days and what *PRO* *EXP*-1 is said *-2 0 <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was like *T*-3
<COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="بو_ثاري">Bu Thari</COREF>
What we know *T*-1 about <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> in recent years is that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had changed a lot .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had Islamic tendecies and acts which many Iraqis mentioned *T*-1 , *PRO*-2 saying that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> supported to a great extent the building of mosques centers for *PRO* memorizing Koran , and charities , and the dancer 's punishment was death .
<COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> had many works .
But some explained <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> Islamic tendency by *PRO*-1 saying that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was currying favor with <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">the Sunnis</COREF> as if <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were reading <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> mind .
<COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="بو_ثاري">I</COREF> have followed <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> , especially in recent years , and <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="بو_ثاري">I</COREF> noticed about <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> was that there was religion but there was injustice and coarseness .
And <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> punishment was unjust .
<COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="بو_ثاري">I</COREF> mean , 0 for example , the dancer would be killed *-1 after second offence .
<COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="بو_ثاري">I</COREF> did not expect anyone to <COREF ID="1__56" TYPE="IDENT">kill</COREF> the dancer unless good would come of <COREF ID="1__56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , but like the most idiots his aim was correct but the method was wrong .
Another example - after <COREF ID="1__62" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son</COREF> <COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Udai</COREF></COREF> harmed the Iraqi people and attacked women and other matters , <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> ordered <COREF ID="1__62" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 to be killed *-2 .
And in fact <COREF ID="1__62" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was fired on *-1 but survived miraculously , after *PRO*-1 being hit *-2 with several fatal shots some of which *T*-3 hit <COREF ID="1__62" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> spine .
This is a sign that there was good in <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> otherwise <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would not have ordered the killing of <COREF ID="1__62" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__85" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD"><COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> son</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__85" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> own child</COREF></COREF> .
But <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was not a scholar nor feared *-1 in God .
<COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="بو_ثاري">I <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="بو_ثاري">myself</COREF></COREF> heard from some people who *T*-1 were in Iraq about the things that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> used *-2 to do *T*-3 , and *T*-3 could not be reasonably done *-4 by anyone other than a good Moslem To the extent that many said of <COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> actions</COREF> that <COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were only *PRO*-5 to gain favor amongst the Sunnis and the religious .
But we judge by the appearances and <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> end was in line with the appearance .
In <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> last days during the fall of Baghdad and <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> disappearance , <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">an old woman or man</COREF> said on TV on al - Jazeera channel that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was hiding in <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> house and had had <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> prayer mat with <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and was always praying and reading <COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">the Koran</COREF> .
Do we say no , this is hypocrisy ?
*PRO* Bear in mind that many have said that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> prayed regularly especially after <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was put *-1 in prison by <COREF ID="2__27" TYPE="IDENT">the Rafida</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__27" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> masters .
Some of those who *T*-1 said that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was always praying and reading <COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">the Koran</COREF> are the Christians who *T*-2 visited <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> prison cell .
Finally , during <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> hanging , <COREF ID="2__39" TYPE="IDENT">the Rafida</COREF> tried *PRO*-1 to distract <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and keep <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> from *PRO*-2 saying <COREF ID="2__42" TYPE="IDENT">the Creed</COREF> before <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> death .
<COREF ID="2__39" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> were trying everything 0 <COREF ID="2__39" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could *?* *T*-1 but we say that <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> made <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> steadfast for the whole world to see that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> died *PRO*-2 acknowledging <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">The Rafida</COREF> were shouting provocative words such as Muqtada and al - Sadr so that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would lose control and curse <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , then <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would have killed <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could show the clip in which there is cursing and insults from <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam</COREF> *T*-1 and cut the rest .
However <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> <COREF ID="2__75" TYPE="IDENT">remained</COREF> steadfast in *PRO*-1 saying <COREF ID="2__42" TYPE="IDENT">the creed</COREF> and was killed *-1 whilst *PRO*-2 saying <COREF ID="2__42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="بو_ثاري">I</COREF> believe that <COREF ID="2__75" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> could n't have happened without <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> making <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> steadfast otherwise <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> would not have made <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> steadfast in it .
As one of the sheikhs says *?* , <COREF ID="2__83" TYPE="IDENT">many people</COREF> when <COREF ID="2__83" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were supposed *-1 to say <COREF ID="2__42" TYPE="IDENT">the creed</COREF> and were being dictated *-1 <COREF ID="2__42" TYPE="IDENT">the creed</COREF> by those present *T*-2 would murmur " Did love see drunkards ? "
<COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="IDENT">Other people</COREF> say , <COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have not said <COREF ID="2__42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> while <COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was alive and you want <COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> to say <COREF ID="2__42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> when <COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am dying *T*-1 ... the truth is what *T*-2 is apparent .
But <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">Saddam Hussein</COREF> was reasonable in that <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> repented and turned to <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> creator who *T*-1 receives the repentance from <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> slave</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> committed <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> to the worship of <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> . And remained loyal to <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="بو_ثاري">I</COREF> ask <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> *PRO*-1 to have mercy on <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and to forgive <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> and to give <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> an ample dwelling in <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> paradise and guide the rest of the Ba'thists .
