After *PRO* Forcing <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> *PRO*-1 to Get Divorced *-2 , <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi Woman</COREF> Prefers Prison to *PRO* Returning to <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Her</COREF> Family</COREF>
<COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="ساره_الحمد">Sarah al - Hamad</COREF>
<COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">The divorce case for inequality in lineage</COREF> took a new turn , yesterday morning , when <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the wife</COREF> refused *PRO*-1 to be handed *-2 over to <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> relatives</COREF> in the police station of <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">the governorate of al - Khobar</COREF> *T*-6 , especially since the Saudi public , which *T*-3 has been following <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> , was expecting that <COREF ID="1__7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> would end after <COREF ID="1__20" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court , which *T*-4 is considered *-5 the highest judicial authority in Saudi Arabia</COREF> , reached a verdict confirming the separation of the couple .
Al - Watan has learned from <COREF ID="1__28" TYPE="IDENT">security sources</COREF> that the police of <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">the governorate of al - Khobar</COREF> submitted an official request *ICH*-1 to the administration of <COREF ID="1__34" TYPE="IDENT">the prison at <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">al - Dammam</COREF></COREF> *PRO* to bring <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the inmate</COREF> <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Fatima</COREF></COREF> on basis of the verdict issued * by <COREF ID="1__20" TYPE="IDENT">the Supreme Court</COREF> two days ago , and the demand *ICH*-2 of <COREF ID="1__a2e_0004.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">members of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> family</COREF></COREF> *PRO* to hand <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> over to <COREF ID="1__a2e_0004.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> as <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> sole means of support .
<COREF ID="1__28" TYPE="IDENT">The sources</COREF> added that when <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the wife</COREF> entered the police station of <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">the governorate of al - Khobar</COREF> *PRO*-2 accompanied *-3 by some female prison guards and security men *T*-1 <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> was received *-4 by <COREF ID="1__59" TYPE="IDENT">some of the members of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> family</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mother</COREF> with the aim of *PRO* receiving <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> .
The surprise was the refusal *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Fatima</COREF> *PRO* to go with <COREF ID="1__59" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
In spite of the endeavors that *T*-1 lasted for several hours , <COREF ID="1__75" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> brothers</COREF> were unable *PRO*-2 to convince <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> *PRO*-3 to go with <COREF ID="1__75" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to the house of <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">the family</COREF> in <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">the governorate of al - Khobar</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">Officials in the police station of <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">al - Khobar</COREF></COREF> were embarrassed by the situation , because of <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the wife 's</COREF> insistence *PRO* not to go with <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> relatives</COREF> .. While the law stipulates that <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the wife</COREF> be handed *-1 over to <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
So <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">the officials</COREF> just returned <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> to <COREF ID="1__34" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">al - Dammam</COREF> prison</COREF> *PRO* to end the issue , and try *PRO*-1 to convince <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> in few days .

<COREF ID="2__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="NetExpert">NetExpert</COREF>
Previously <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">an article about the conduct of <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the husband</COREF></COREF> was published *-1 in <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">this forum</COREF> .
The posting of <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">the article</COREF> revealed other aspects .
<COREF ID="2__a2e_0004.part-001.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> published <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">copies of legal documents</COREF> because <COREF ID="2__a2e_0004.part-001.aif-E2" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> wanted *PRO*-1 to use <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-5 to prove that <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> was not based *-2 on inequality in lineage , but that <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was related *-3 to <COREF ID="2__18" TYPE="IDENT">behavioral aspects of <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF></COREF> ,
foremost among <COREF ID="2__18" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> is *T*-1 desertion and abandonment for a long time .
Now the newspapers , which <COREF ID="2__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="NetExpert">I</COREF> do not trust *T*-1 , still declare that inequality in lineage is the reason .
In fact , a lot of talk *ICH*-1 is circulating among people about <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> , because *PRO* accepting the notion of the possibility of *PRO* separating <COREF ID="2__35" TYPE="IDENT">a wife</COREF> from <COREF ID="2__35" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband by a decision outside <COREF ID="2__38" TYPE="IDENT">the relationship</COREF> -LRB- or even inside <COREF ID="2__38" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> -RRB- on the basis of disparity in the relative streams is a matter that *T*-2 robs the society of sleep and causes an exploding moral and social crisis which *T*-3 will have no end .
If what *T*-1 was previously published *-2 in <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">the forum</COREF> *ICH*-3 <COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> true , that <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF> was separated *-4 from her for other reasons , <COREF ID="2__53" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> would be reassuring .
ِAnyway , *PRO* transforming tradition and calling ignorance *PRO*-1 a legitimate basis for a verdict in a certain case is a matter which *T*-2 can not be accepted , believed , or trusted *-3 to be connected *-5 with <COREF ID="2__60" TYPE="IDENT">Sharia</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__60" TYPE="IDENT">Sharia</COREF> is unequivocal and straightforward .
No one was forced *-1 *PRO*-2 to accept *RNR*-3 and consent to *RNR*-3 any marriage .
The glorious legislator would not have placed <COREF ID="2__65" TYPE="IDENT">the decision of matrimony</COREF> in the hand of <COREF ID="2__a2e_0004.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the guardian</COREF> and put conditions on <COREF ID="2__65" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and facilitate a legitimate alternative for <COREF ID="2__a2e_0004.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in case of <COREF ID="2__a2e_0004.part-001.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> absence , unless the decision was final .
Then would someone come afterwards *PRO* to annul this and lean on the -LRB- Revelation -RRB- in such a thing ???
As <COREF ID="2__93" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="NetExpert">I</COREF> said *?* : if it *EXP*-1 was true that equality in lineage was the reason for the separation then may <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> perish , may <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> perish , may <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> perish !
This is a first and last point of view ...

There is no doubt that <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">Abd al - Rahman al - Lahim</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> entourage of pretenders of liberalism</COREF></COREF> are dancing with joy at <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the judge 's</COREF> verdict</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> will be eager *PRO*-1 to exploit these former couples *PRO* to bid on justice in <COREF ID="1__16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__20" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> country</COREF> and on <COREF ID="1__16" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__20" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> country in western organizations</COREF> , so political pressure will increase on <COREF ID="1__20" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> *PRO* to incapacitate the legitimate judiciary .
The problem with <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">al - Lahim</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">the pretenders of liberalism</COREF></COREF> is that <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to judge our Islamic values by western standards .
That 's why we found <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">al - Lahim</COREF> impertinently declaring to <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the newspaper</COREF> <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Al - Hayat</COREF> that <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT">this verdict</COREF> contradicts the articles which the kingdom signed *T*-1 in the memorandum on human rights *T*-2 ...
In the countries of <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">the west</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__48" TYPE="IDENT">any man</COREF> is taken *-1 to prison when <COREF ID="1__48" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> marries another woman in addition to <COREF ID="1__48" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife *T*-2 or when <COREF ID="1__48" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> marries a woman less than 18 years old *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">Any father</COREF> is prevented *-1 from *PRO*-2 interfering in the affairs of <COREF ID="1__57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> daughter</COREF> , even if <COREF ID="1__57" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__63" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> daughter</COREF> works as a prostitute , after <COREF ID="1__57" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> is 18 years of age .
In the countries of <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">the west</COREF> , you are not granted *-1 citizenship until you promise *PRO*-2 to respect the rights of <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">gay men and lesbians</COREF> .
You are even given *-1 <COREF ID="1__79" TYPE="IDENT">a written exam on your attitude towards <COREF ID="1__71" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF></COREF> ... and much more than <COREF ID="1__79" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> .
The pretenders of liberalism want *PRO*-1 to exploit <COREF ID="1__16" TYPE="IDENT">our country 's</COREF> signature on some human rights treaties in order *PRO* to force <COREF ID="1__87" TYPE="IDENT">our society</COREF> *PRO*-2 to accept values and habits 0 <COREF ID="1__87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do not recognize *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">The case of <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">this couple</COREF></COREF> was exploited *-1 by our press which *T*-2 is controlled *-3 by the pretenders of liberalism in order *PRO* to outbid on <COREF ID="1__98" TYPE="IDENT">our judiciary</COREF> and tarnish <COREF ID="1__98" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> image in front of the people here and abroad .
<COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">The judge who *T*-1 tried <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF></COREF> was frank when <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> based <COREF ID="1__10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> verdict</COREF> on the benefit and harm resulting from the continuance of this marriage *T*-2 .
There is no doubt that <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">many</COREF> sympathize with <COREF ID="1__116" TYPE="IDENT">this woman</COREF> , and <COREF ID="1__170" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الأحنف_بن_مالك">I</COREF> am one of <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
But there are <COREF ID="1__121" TYPE="IDENT">other girls in <COREF ID="1__116" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> tribe who *T*-1 are not married</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is our duty *PRO* to sympathize with <COREF ID="1__121" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> tragedy when suitors shun <COREF ID="1__121" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *T*-2 .
If <COREF ID="1__131" TYPE="IDENT">the pretenders of liberalism who *T*-1 undertook the defense of <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">this couple</COREF></COREF> have one atom of credibility , <COREF ID="1__131" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would have exposed to us the other face of <COREF ID="1__140" TYPE="IDENT">this lying and deceitful husband who *T*-2 was exposed *-3 by <COREF ID="1__140" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> first wife</COREF> .

*PRO* Considering benefits and harms is applied *-1 by <COREF ID="1__158" TYPE="IDENT">many countries</COREF> in <COREF ID="1__158" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> positive judiciary .

Separation of <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">the couple</COREF> for inequality in lineage .
<COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi public opinion</COREF> has not been occupied *-1 lately by a social case as much as <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has been *?* *-2 by <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">the case of the separation of <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">a couple</COREF> for inequality in lineage after <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had two children and desired *PRO*-3 to continue <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> conjugal life</COREF> .
Days ago <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">the Court of Appeals in Riyadh</COREF> <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">confirmed</COREF> <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT">the verdict issued * by the court of al - Jawf for <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">the couple</COREF> to separate</COREF> ..
According to <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the defense attorney</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__28" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Abd al - Rahman al - Lahim</COREF></COREF> , <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> means that <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> is closed as far as the judicial aspect is concerned *-1 unless new and productive facts come into existence in <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">the case</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__155" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="شجي">I</COREF> am not here *PRO*-1 to discuss <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT">the judicial verdict</COREF> , or to proceed in the context of the different viewpoint of the defense .
There is total respect for *RNR*-1 and confidence in *RNR*-1 the verdicts of the judiciary .
But what <COREF ID="2__155" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="شجي">I</COREF> would like *PRO*-1 to refer to *T*-2 in connection with <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> has *PRO*-3 to do with the necessity of *PRO* educating people about equality of lineage in marriage before one finds oneself involved in the same fate as that of <COREF ID="1__93" TYPE="IDENT">Fatima and Mansour</COREF> .
There is <COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">a large portion of people who *T*-1 get married without *PRO* keeping in mind - out of ignorance - <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">this issue , which *T*-2 can threaten <COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> family life at any moment when a member of the wife 's family objects to the lineage of the husband *T*-3</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__155" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="شجي">I</COREF> declare that <COREF ID="2__155" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="شجي">I</COREF> have attended many marriage ceremonies during <COREF ID="2__155" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="شجي">my</COREF> lifetime .
But <COREF ID="2__155" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="شجي">I</COREF> do not remember even one marriage official who *T*-1 brought up <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> by *PRO*-2 asking <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">the groom</COREF> about <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> lineage before *PRO*-3 finalizing the contract .
He ought *-1 to have done so as long as <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> has such a level of consideration .
<COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> can threaten the family life of the bride and groom at any future moment .
Therefore , the educational and religious institutions in the country are obliged *-1 socially *PRO*-2 to educate the society in a more profound way .
There is no stronger evidence of the ignorance by a large sector of the possibility of separation because of inequality in lineage than the social debate stirred * up by <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">this issue</COREF> , which *T*-1 was not limited *-2 to the common people but extended *-2 to <COREF ID="2__109" TYPE="IDENT">writers , cultured people , and lawyers , foremost among <COREF ID="2__109" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> <COREF ID="2__115" TYPE="IDENT">the defense lawyer who *T*-3 issued a statement *ICH*-5 after <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT">the verdict</COREF> was issued *-4 by <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">the Court of Appeals</COREF> expressing that <COREF ID="2__115" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would continue *-6 to stick to <COREF ID="2__115" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> position with regard to <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT">the verdict that *T*-7 was issued *-8</COREF></COREF></COREF> .
Maybe it is also the duty of our media institutions which *T*-1 presented <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">this case</COREF> to the public opinion by *PRO*-2 following <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT">the verdict issued * by <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">the Court of Appeals</COREF></COREF> with intensive interviews with a number of jurists and scholars concerning <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> and other issues .
<COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">This case</COREF> revealed that there are many things that we lack knowledge about *T*-1 as a society before we plunge into the debate of issues with others .

*PRO* Assuming that the couple 's order of separation is traced *-1 to what *T*-2 are referred to *-3 as " behavioral aspects " such as the desertion of <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">the husband</COREF> and a long - term conditional divorce , what should <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the wife</COREF> do *T*-4 , <COREF ID="1__136" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="ساره_الحمد">I</COREF> wonder *T*-5 .
Hold on to <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> husband</COREF> and prefer prison to *PRO* going with <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> mother and siblings ?
Then ... is the court entitled *-1 to interfere between <COREF ID="1__72" TYPE="IDENT">a husband</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__73" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__72" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife</COREF> for flimsy " behavioral " reasons which <COREF ID="1__73" TYPE="IDENT">the wife</COREF> accepts *T*-2 ?
It seems that the supposition to which <COREF ID="1__79" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> referred *T*-1 in <COREF ID="1__79" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> participation is illogical .
And what *T*-1 is " behind the hill " is the issue of " equality in lineage , " nothing else ...
<COREF ID="1__136" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="ساره_الحمد">I</COREF> do not think that there is one Muslim who *T*-1 accepts <COREF ID="1__90" TYPE="IDENT">the verdict of the Supreme Court</COREF> because <COREF ID="1__90" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a racist verdict and blatant interference between <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">a husband</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife</COREF> for trivial reasons .

<COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> suffices for <COREF ID="2__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="تأبط_شيئا">me</COREF> , and <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is the best agent .
<COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Mansour al - Taymani</COREF> , according to <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> former wife</COREF> <COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ahlam</COREF></COREF> , is a man with drug - related cases against <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> by the police of al - Jawf .
And morals cases .
<COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">The wife</COREF> appeared on Al - Ekhbariyah channel *PRO* to expose <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF> .
Why all this sympathy ?
<COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> suffices for <COREF ID="2__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="تأبط_شيئا">me</COREF> against you liberals who *T*-1 defamed <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Fatima</COREF> .
A question : do n't you think that <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Fatima</COREF> was subjected *-1 to sorcery by <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">this al - Taymani</COREF> ?
And *PRO* say , <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="تأبط_شيئا">my</COREF> Lord</COREF> , *PRO* increase <COREF ID="2__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="تأبط_شيئا">my</COREF> knowledge .

<COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">The former wife</COREF> is not a trusted source of information for a very simple reason , namely that <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> most likely still bears some grudge against <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> former husband</COREF> and against <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the woman who *T*-1 " stole " <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">that husband</COREF> from <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF></COREF> .
Really , what *T*-1 would urge <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">this woman</COREF> *PRO*-2 to say what <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> said *T*-3 about <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> former husband</COREF> in a program watched * by everyone ?
Does <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> conduct have any connection with noble morality ?
The ones who *T*-1 defamed <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the wife</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__136" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="ساره_الحمد">my</COREF> dear , are undoubtedly the racist judges and the relatives of <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the wife</COREF> .
By the way , <COREF ID="2__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="تأبط_شيئا">Ta'abbata</COREF> , can we say -LRB- by analogy with what <COREF ID="2__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="تأبط_شيئا">you</COREF> mentioned *T*-1 -RRB- that the racist judges and <COREF ID="2__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">the wife 's</COREF> relatives were exposed *-2 to the sorcery of <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the former wife</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Ahlam</COREF></COREF> ?
and why not ?!!...
Have n't sorcery and liberalism and other amazing concepts become worn out excuses used * by some *PRO* to avoid *PRO*-1 facing reality frankly and courageously ?
