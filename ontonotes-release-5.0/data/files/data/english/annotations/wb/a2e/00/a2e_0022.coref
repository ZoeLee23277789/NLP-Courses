<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> says : All Qataris Want <COREF ID="2__107" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__158" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الوجبه">Al - Wajba</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__158" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الوجبه">Al - Wajba</COREF> salutes you and says : *PRO* Passing by the Saudi airspace , <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> arrived in <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> for a short visit to <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> Debates program</COREF> with <COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">a special invitation</COREF> since there will be a miniature democratic seminar *PRO* to study and discuss <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">a number of issues</COREF> and the ways of *PRO* tackling <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> ...
<COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">The Doha Debates</COREF> are considered *-1 to be a miniature source of democracy in a big oasis that *T*-2 gathers the Qataris in a unique mixture of intellectual openness to the world and awareness of all that *T*-3 is happening in an atmosphere removed * from any twitching or nervousness in an attempt *PRO* to solve issues in a totally calm way ..
<COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar 's</COREF> reception for <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Shimon Peres</COREF> came from this angle .. *PRO* addressing the mind and conversing *PRO* to create a solution for many pending matters and also to make the Qatari public in particular and the Arab public in general understand what *T*-1 takes place in a democratic atmosphere ..
In <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> there are many independent universities , both Arab and international , and there are branches of well established international universities .
<COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">The invitation</COREF> was from <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the Doha Debates program</COREF> ..
<COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is a program that *T*-1 gathers together many intellectuals , scientists , heads of state , and others *PRO*-2 to discuss numerous topics with complete transparency and democracy ..
<COREF ID="1__158" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الوجبه">I</COREF> was hoping that <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the Doha Debates program</COREF> would invite <COREF ID="2__124" TYPE="IDENT">Prince Sultan</COREF> *PRO*-1 to ask <COREF ID="2__124" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> about the weapons deal or <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">al - Walid bin Talal</COREF> *PRO*-2 to ask <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> about waste and the launching of the songs channels , or <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">Luluah al - Faisal</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> future ambitions ..
*PRO* Claiming power by *PRO* being silent is something shameful for <COREF ID="1__81" TYPE="IDENT">some countries</COREF> as is *?* *PRO* deluding the people with <COREF ID="1__81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> silence into *PRO*-1 thinking that <COREF ID="1__81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are powerful while in fact <COREF ID="1__81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are hiding <COREF ID="1__81" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> weakness .
<COREF ID="1__158" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الوجبه">I</COREF> think that <COREF ID="1__91" TYPE="IDENT">dialogue</COREF> is neither a shame nor should <COREF ID="1__91" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> be rejected *-1 ..
You talk to <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">your enemy</COREF> and discuss with <COREF ID="1__95" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> ..
But <COREF ID="1__98" TYPE="IDENT">the closed door policy</COREF> .. <COREF ID="1__98" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> is a disaster for the people and a pretense that you are brave through a lying and trumpeting media while in the end you fail in the least confrontation ..
Back to the main issue .. we say who is <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> *T*-1 ?
No one denies that <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> is a criminal .
But who is <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> *T*-1 ?
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> received <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">the Nobel Peace Prize</COREF> in 1994 .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> shared <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">the prize</COREF> with both <COREF ID="1__122" TYPE="IDENT">Yasser Arafat</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__124" TYPE="IDENT">the Israeli Prime Minister at that time</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__124" TYPE="IDENT">Yitzhak Rabin</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> has a special interest in precision electronics .
In 1997 , <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> established <COREF ID="1__132" TYPE="IDENT">the " Peres Center for Peace</COREF> . "
In other words , <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF> is looking for more peace than war .
There is a difference between *PRO* holding discussions with a man of peace and holding discussions with a man looking for war ..
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> is also a man who *T*-1 received <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">the Nobel Peace Prize</COREF> jointly with <COREF ID="1__122" TYPE="IDENT">Arafat</COREF> ..
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> spent money *PRO* establishing <COREF ID="1__132" TYPE="IDENT">the Peres Center for Peace</COREF> while <COREF ID="1__122" TYPE="IDENT">Yasser Arafat</COREF> spent money on <COREF ID="1__122" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> wife .
We have n't heard that he established any organization 0 *T*-1 to support the Palestinian people with that money ..
When <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> took office as Prime Minister *T*-1 <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> concluded successful transactions *PRO* to acquire weapons .
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> also sought *PRO*-1 to establish a deterrent nuclear program since <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> owns the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world .
All this was during <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> tenure .
This means that <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">the man</COREF> thinks and plans .
This is due to <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> knowledge and studies in <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> field of electronics ..
Again we say that knowledge is a powerful weapon for any national progress ..
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> attained this as a result of .. knowledge and proficiency .. in <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> personality , which *T*-1 helped *PRO* give <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> an edge in *PRO* confronting any situation by *PRO* putting <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> in a position of strength , and not weakness ..
Conversely , we see the squandering of money on the other side for trivial things that *T*-1 do not serve the Palestinian cause and do not serve the Arabs and the Muslims .
We find numerous satellite channels financed * by Islamic countries , and we also find <COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">numerous princes and kings and presidents who *T*-1 spend large amounts of money on <COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> vacations</COREF> .
We also find that most of the Arab people and some Gulf people live below the poverty line ..
Furthermore , <COREF ID="2__68" TYPE="IDENT">most of the presidents of the Arab and Gulf states</COREF> do not have any high scientific degree or any sound plan *PRO* to build a strong country at the scientific level ..
<COREF ID="2__68" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> do not even have any interest in education or in *PRO* establishing strong universities in the first place , except for <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> .
Back to our topic .
<COREF ID="2__84" TYPE="IDENT">Some of those who *T*-1 posted pictures in the forum</COREF> did not mention <COREF ID="2__88" TYPE="IDENT">the topic</COREF> and did not refer to the reason for the visit .
<COREF ID="2__84" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> just posted the pictures and commented on <COREF ID="2__88" TYPE="IDENT">the topic</COREF> from <COREF ID="2__84" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> imagination ..
<COREF ID="2__124" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__97" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="2__124" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> Highness</COREF> <COREF ID="2__97" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Prince</COREF></COREF> receives <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">the man of peace</COREF> in <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> in an attempt *PRO* to bring <COREF ID="2__107" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__14" TYPE="IDENT">Israel</COREF> together .
All this in consultation with Hamas in Syria and Palestine so as *PRO* to bring views closer ..
<COREF ID="1__158" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الوجبه">I</COREF> think that this approach of *PRO* holding a meeting between <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__107" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> without preliminary agreement by the leaders of <COREF ID="2__107" TYPE="IDENT">Hamas</COREF> basically holds no benefit for <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> .

<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres 's</COREF> visit to <COREF ID="1__161" TYPE="IDENT">the students '</COREF> hall so <COREF ID="1__161" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> could talk to <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> -LRB- as a man of peace -RRB- and not as a Jew or a war criminal .. that *ICH*-1 is something normal for any visiting official to be received *-2 by university officials .
<COREF ID="1__175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الوجبه">I</COREF> think that the picture is normal .
Discussion of the Arab - Israeli situation by the students in a unique democratic oasis in <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> .
All sides are there .. *PRO*-1 debating , discussing , arguing in a democratic atmosphere difficult 0 *PRO* to see *T*-2 in any country ..
<COREF ID="1__175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الوجبه">I</COREF> think , in <COREF ID="1__175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الوجبه">my</COREF> opinion , that if democracy in <COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">some of the neighboring countries</COREF> is non-existent in the simplest matters related * to <COREF ID="2__17" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> personal rights</COREF> and the demand for <COREF ID="2__17" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> . Then how could <COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> reach to the level of <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> in *PRO*-1 gathering this huge number of intellectuals , politicians , and heads of state *PRO* to discuss sensitive issues that *T*-2 concern the Arab World *T*-3 ?
After <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> went beyond local democracy and human rights in <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> .. *PRO* praise God and many thanks to <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB"><COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> Highness</COREF> <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al - Thani</COREF> , who *T*-1 established democracy and freedom in <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> .. and made <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> a platform for dialogue</COREF> .. so the discussion took place in <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> .
There was <COREF ID="2__54" TYPE="IDENT">disagreement and agreement</COREF> , and <COREF ID="2__54" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is something normal as a result of the present atmosphere ..
But on the other hand , we find different meetings without any outcome because of the lack of democratic basis for dialogue .
All that results from *PRO* not accepting various opinions .
Conversely , as a result of the lack of freedom among the Arab people we find that it is <COREF ID="2__74" TYPE="IDENT">America</COREF> which *T*-1 is in the driver 's seat and steers <COREF ID="2__77" TYPE="IDENT">guests</COREF> wherever <COREF ID="2__74" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> wants *?* *T*-2 and takes <COREF ID="2__77" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> on tours without any questioning directed * at <COREF ID="2__74" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
All this marginalizes <COREF ID="2__84" TYPE="IDENT">the Arab individual</COREF> as though <COREF ID="2__84" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had no -LRB- mind -RRB- or -LRB- opinion -RRB- , and you find that the areas 0 <COREF ID="2__84" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is allowed *-1 to talk about *T*-2 are women driving in Saudi Arabia and similar useless topics ..
<COREF ID="1__175" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="الوجبه">I</COREF> would like *PRO*-1 to explain something to the brothers : <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres 's</COREF> visit is an internal Qatari affair .
It *EXP*-2 was announced *-1 in the newspapers that <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> would visit <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> , and it was announced *-3 in the three Qatari newspapers .
There are writers in <COREF ID="2__6" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> who *T*-1 have positive opinions as well as negative opinions .
This difference is good and something through which nations and people progress *T*-1 .
That is what *T*-1 happened in the forum .
While <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> was leaving the hall , <COREF ID="2__118" TYPE="IDENT">a student</COREF> addressed <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Shimon Peres</COREF> with the word " terrorist " .. " terrorist " in English , which *T*-1 caused the accompanying Qatari security to intervene *PRO* to prevent <COREF ID="2__118" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> from *PRO*-2 continuing .
But the question now is : Who *ICH*-2 is *T*-1 better .. <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> or <COREF ID="2__130" TYPE="IDENT">George Bush</COREF> ?
How many did <COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> kill *T*-1 and how many did <COREF ID="2__130" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> kill *T*-2 ?
Goodbye .

If we could agree that we fall behind the Zionists and Americans in such fields ... however the problem lies in *PRO* ignoring all this clear evidence that the scientific project is nothing but a small misleading part of a campaign meant * to change the Islamic Gulf and Qatari identity and to remove <COREF ID="1__18" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> established fixed principles in which <COREF ID="1__18" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> surpass everything that the Zionists and the Americans have *T*-1 *T*-2 .

So ... the purely scientific and technological side can not justify what *T*-1 is happening in <COREF ID="1__18" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> .
*****
Secondly , the contradiction of principle and the dominance of worldly interests .
In <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> article here , <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> justified the legitimacy of *PRO* hosting Peres from the perspective of *PRO* exchanging opinions , dialogue , and *PRO* using intellect ...
Would <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have held the same position if a terrorist or a well - known criminal were hosted *-1 under the slogan of , the language of reason , friendly media dialogue , and openness to the other ?...
Would <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> accept it if <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> neighbor hosted someone who *T*-1 had attacked <COREF ID="1__38" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> ??
So ... there are <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">principles that *T*-1 must be adhered to *-2</COREF> ..
The most important of <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> is *PRO* supporting the truth and loyalty to Muslims even if it goes against narrow personal interests ... and <COREF ID="1__122" TYPE="IDENT">the relationship of <COREF ID="1__123" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi Arabia</COREF> with <COREF ID="1__124" TYPE="IDENT">the Americans</COREF></COREF> ...
Despite <COREF ID="1__150" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="العبد_الفقير">my</COREF> being convinced *-1 that <COREF ID="1__122" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> should be limited *-2 after <COREF ID="1__124" TYPE="IDENT">the latter 's</COREF> aggression , it does not in any way reach the level of the relationship of <COREF ID="1__18" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> with <COREF ID="1__124" TYPE="IDENT">the Americans <COREF ID="1__124" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF></COREF> .
-LRB- The tension in the relations with <COREF ID="1__123" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi Arabia</COREF> recently and the military base on the Qatari territory despite the state of peace in the region are evidence of that -RRB- ...
So how come <COREF ID="1__18" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> is now adding to this with intimate relations with those whose existence and history and reality *T*-1 are entirely connected *-2 to aggression against Muslims .. namely the Zionists !!?
<COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="IDENT">A mistake</COREF> can not be justified *-1 by *PRO* committing a bigger mistake or proceeding further in <COREF ID="2__8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> !! .
****
Thirdly , *PRO* going overboard with freedom :
There is a kind of mania in the field of freedom that *T*-1 makes many people think that every freedom is commendable .. While *PRO* giving free rein to freedom is a recipe for chaos and corruption .. even in the field of speech or science ...
For example , there is no room for freedom in *PRO* talking about <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> and <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> Prophet and <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">His</COREF> verses since it comes in the context of what *T*-1 brought the disbelievers to hell .
But we used *-1 to embark boldly with bold talkers ..
There is no room for *PRO* leaving the door *PRO*-1 wide open for *PRO* discussing or teaching " science and technology " as the theory of development .. or the theories of Darwin .. or how *PRO* to make bombs or liquor *T*-2 .. or the creeds of polytheism or excessiveness in *PRO* regarding others as unbelievers .. or <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">the sciences of *PRO* judging with anything other than the revelations of <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF></COREF> -LRB- except by the way of *PRO* warning against <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> -RRB- ..
So ... *PRO* <COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">imposing</COREF> censorship and certain regulations on the work of <COREF ID="2__65" TYPE="IDENT">educational and media institutions</COREF> is not a matter for censure or a sign of backwardness ... rather <COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> might be a necessary and urgent requirement ... especially if those in charge of <COREF ID="2__65" TYPE="IDENT">theses institutions</COREF> are non-Muslims .. or if the ones exposed * are our younger generation and the treasures of our nation !!.
You might even be filled *-1 with admiration of the contradiction in attitudes when you see the " supporters of freedom " demanding the imposition of government censorship on courses in Koran memorization , charitable institutions , and the pulpits in some of our countries *T*-2 !!!!.

What *T*-1 is happening in <COREF ID="1__18" TYPE="IDENT">Qatar</COREF> is a political and intellectual penetration in <COREF ID="2__103" TYPE="IDENT">the countries of the region</COREF> in every meaning of the word ..
The danger 0 <COREF ID="2__103" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> face *T*-1 is very serious ...
Of course , <COREF ID="2__110" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to penetrate us</COREF> will not declare that ...
Rather , <COREF ID="2__110" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will hide <COREF ID="2__110" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> aims behind sweet words or promises of *PRO* providing limited or imaginary benefits ...
Otherwise , we would not be deceived *-1 by the trick ...
For <COREF ID="2__122" TYPE="IDENT">many Muslims today</COREF> <COREF ID="2__122" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> priorities are confused ...
So <COREF ID="2__122" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> weigh things without the guidance of <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> ...
This is the real reason for our present situation .. not just because of scientific or technological backwardness .
-LRB- You will find the Jews and polytheists the ones most hostile to the believers -RRB- .
-LRB- <COREF ID="2__30" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> forbids you *PRO*-1 to turn in friendship to <COREF ID="2__143" TYPE="IDENT">those who *T*-2 fought against you with regard to your religion and who *T*-3 drove you out of your homes and who *T*-4 helped others drive you out</COREF> .
Those who *T*-1 turn to <COREF ID="2__143" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> are evildoers -RRB- .

<COREF ID="1__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="أبو_كرم">I</COREF> took <COREF ID="1__31" TYPE="IDENT">a course *ICH*-1</COREF> at <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">the General Administration Institute</COREF> in the field of computers and <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">Qatari trainees</COREF> attended <COREF ID="1__31" TYPE="IDENT">the course</COREF> with us ..
What *T*-1 happened was that after two days <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">those Qataris</COREF> disappeared and <COREF ID="1__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="أبو_كرم">I</COREF> never saw <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> again ..
<COREF ID="1__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="أبو_كرم">I</COREF> saw <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> a week later in the restaurant of <COREF ID="1__32" TYPE="IDENT">the institute</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="أبو_كرم">I</COREF> asked <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> " <COREF ID="1__141" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="أبو_كرم">I</COREF> hope that nothing bad has happened .

<COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> said ,, <COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT">The lecturer</COREF> comes in , gives the lecture , and leaves but <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> do not understand anything even though <COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is an Egyptian Arab ..
<COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> decided *PRO*-1 to transfer to a course that *T*-2 is easier than <COREF ID="1__31" TYPE="IDENT">this one</COREF> in the field of administration .
The director of admissions understood <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> situation and accepted the transfer to a program in administration .
So why should <COREF ID="1__35" TYPE="IDENT">we</COREF> go back to Qatar without *PRO* getting a degree *T*-1 ? "
But <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">al - Wajba</COREF> , are sitting here *PRO*-1 philosophizing , telling lies , and saying that <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have an advanced educational system .
And by the way , there were also <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">Omanis with us</COREF> , and <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> completed <COREF ID="1__31" TYPE="IDENT">the course</COREF> normally with us ..

Shalom , <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">al - Wajba</COREF> ... It is really <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> and not the Qatari people ...
<COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are a rich meal for every enemy of the Arabs and Muslims ...
Congratulations for *PRO* having <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> , and shalom to <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> from <COREF ID="1__120" TYPE="IDENT">Sharon whose health <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> pray for *T*-1 so <COREF ID="1__120" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> can finish off what *ICH*-3 *T*-2 remains of Hamas</COREF> .
Shalom to <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> and to <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> , but *PRO* do n't lie and say 0 <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> came to you through Saudi airspace .
But <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are excused *-1 since it seems that <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do not know where <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> came from *T*-2 .

<COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="sul">sul</COREF>
<COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">That idea of the Saudi airspace</COREF> is nice , but what *T*-1 is nicer than <COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is *PRO* playing host to the democratic enemy in your land ...
But <COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="sul">my</COREF> opinion is for <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> and the Qataris to discuss with <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> the issue of *PRO* murdering innocent children and usurping the rights of others .
Or more clearly , you should ask <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> *PRO*-1 to explain to you how *PRO* to hate <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">your neighbors</COREF> *T*-2 and maybe <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> would train you in *PRO* usurping <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> rights or train you in *PRO* killing and shedding blood ...
The phrase " away from any prejudice " is also nice .
Do n't <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> have any feelings of group spirit , <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="sul">my</COREF> friend</COREF> ?
What the Jews are doing *T*-1 does not call for any prejudice or bias .
<COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="sul">I</COREF> believe 0 what *T*-1 runs in <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> veins is not blood but cold water ...
<COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> justify this visit by <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">this person , whose hands *T*-1 are stained *-2 with the blood of the Muslims</COREF> , and <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> criticize the weapons deals .
This is normal .
These weapons are for *PRO* defending ourselves against our enemy whom you receive *T*-1 with hugs and so on .. While <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">those who <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> say 0 *T*-2 are strong</COREF> are strong indeed , but not with <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">Peres</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are strong and we wo n't invite <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> to our country *PRO* to discuss <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> culture which we know *T*-1 and <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> know *T*-1 .
But <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are weak , weaker than a fly .
Therefore <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are feigning strength with the descendents of monkeys .
Why should we go that far *T*-1 ?
Previously , <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> foreign minister likened <COREF ID="2__101" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> small country</COREF> to Israel .
What a bad comparison and what <COREF ID="2__101" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was compared *-1 to *T*-2 !
<COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> greatly admire <COREF ID="2__107" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">the Peres 's</COREF> education and <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> academic degrees</COREF> .
Who else other than <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> would *T*-1 admire <COREF ID="2__107" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> ?
<COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> is <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> highest ideal ...

<COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="sul">I</COREF> grieve for <COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="sul">myself</COREF> while <COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="sul">I</COREF> am replying to <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , but people like <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> will not be spared *-1 because <COREF ID="1__77" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> are a shame to Islam and Muslims .
