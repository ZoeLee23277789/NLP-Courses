Plain sentence:

    The newspaper quoted another commander in the Mahdi Army as saying ; " We have taken 10 Sunnis hostages, we will get a
    ransom for five of them, then we will kill them all. In every major hostage-taking operation we get 50 thousand dollars,
    " and he considered it to be the best business a person could be running in Baghdad now !
