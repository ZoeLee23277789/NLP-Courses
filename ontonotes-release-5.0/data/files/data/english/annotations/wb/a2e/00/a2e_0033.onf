    It seems that the endorsement by the US government of the draft bill on the exploitation of the Iraqi national oil
    resources is much more important to the Iraqi government than showing the draft to the Iraqi people and having it
    debated by their independent organizations, its intellectuals, its professionals and the general public.

    The subject of oil from a sectarian or regional point of view was not presented except as a cover for the important main
    questions about the oil policy, these being Firstly : the abrogation of Act 80-LRB-1961-RRB-and its cancellation, by
    successively handing over unexploited oilfields and areas to foreign companies on the basis of long-term participation
    in production contracts, instead of developing them nationally by supporting the national oil companies and making use
    of foreign expertise through short-term service contracts that would leave the wealth in Iraq's hands. Secondly : the
    weakening of the Iraq's negotiating power by weakening the centralization of contracting for the national resources with
    foreign companies and the instruments of such contracting ; not distinguishing between the need to expand the
    administrative powers of the companies and institutions on the one hand, and the need for the centralization of the
    major national economic decisions on the other.
