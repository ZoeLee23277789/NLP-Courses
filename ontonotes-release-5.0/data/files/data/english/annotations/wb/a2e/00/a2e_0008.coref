<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Hissa al - Aoun</COREF> says today what men have not said *T*-1 in an article , and there is nothing more important than it in <COREF ID="1__8" TYPE="IDENT">Saudi Arabia</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__157" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="ناطق_خير">Natiq Khayr</COREF>
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Hissa Abd al - Rahman al - Aoun</COREF>
Accountability of ministries or accountability of companies ?
<COREF ID="1__1" TYPE="IDENT">Hissa Abd al - Rahman al - Aoun</COREF>
From time to time , lots of conferences *ICH*-1 take place *PRO* calling for accountability of companies .
The target of this accountability is <COREF ID="1__26" TYPE="IDENT">joint - stock companies including real estate companies , industrial companies , and others , many of which *T*-1 took the last dime in the pockets of <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">people who *T*-2 yearned for wealth</COREF> and wanted *PRO*-3 to expel the ghost of poverty from <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> lives</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__26" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> are many .
We find an excuse for some of <COREF ID="1__26" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 has been said *-2 that necessity is the mother of invention .
But <COREF ID="1__157" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="ناطق_خير">I</COREF> say 0 necessity is the mother of carelessness .
Of course , <COREF ID="1__157" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="ناطق_خير">I</COREF> find no excuse for <COREF ID="1__26" TYPE="IDENT">these companies</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__157" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="ناطق_خير">I</COREF> will mention <COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT">some of <COREF ID="1__26" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> which *T*-1 formulated all <COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> studies in a way 0 *T*-2 to enable <COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> *PRO*-3 to milk money out of small investors and the poor and widows and orphans through advisory offices which *T*-4 master with perfection feasibility studies with negative action</COREF> .
This is what *T*-1 leads us *PRO*-2 to be sure that <COREF ID="1__73" TYPE="IDENT">everything</COREF> has negative aspects just as <COREF ID="1__73" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has positive aspects , like medicines which *T*-3 cure a disease but while *PRO* doing so cause another disease , and similar repercussions which *T*-4 sometimes lead to destruction .
-LRB- anyway . -RRB-
But why *PRO* not make conferences also similar to those first by *PRO* targeting -LRB- government ministries -RRB- in particular *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="1__8" TYPE="IDENT">The state</COREF> , may <COREF ID="1__87" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> protect <COREF ID="1__8" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , and at <COREF ID="1__8" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> head our wise leadership which *T*-1 has spared no effort *PRO* to serve <COREF ID="1__92" TYPE="IDENT">the Saudi</COREF> in all aspects of <COREF ID="1__92" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> life , the last being <COREF ID="1__130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__97" TYPE="IDENT">this year 's</COREF> budget which , *PRO* thank <COREF ID="1__87" TYPE="IDENT">God</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__87" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> beneficence , *T*-2 surpassed all our expectations</COREF> .
This is the eagerness *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="1__87" TYPE="IDENT">the father of all</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__87" TYPE="IDENT">the good king</COREF> , *PRO* to make us happy .
Before , it was <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">last year 's budget which *T*-1 was also a happy surprise</COREF> .
And before <COREF ID="1__115" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , dozens of annual budgets which *T*-1 were prepared *-2 for the development of <COREF ID="1__8" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> and the citizen .
Consequently , we do not see <COREF ID="1__126" TYPE="IDENT">this budget</COREF> spent *-1 as we would like and look forward to *?* , but rather as *PRO* recommended *-2 by the leadership in how * to spend <COREF ID="1__126" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-3 .
Back to <COREF ID="1__130" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__97" TYPE="IDENT">this year 's</COREF> budget , which *T*-1 surpassed all bets , and was appropriate for a country like ours</COREF> .
This is what *T*-1 leads <COREF ID="1__157" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="ناطق_خير">me</COREF> *PRO*-2 to demand monitoring of these ministries whose safes *T*-3 have suffered indigestion from the budgets that *T*-4 end all the lean years and halt all the series of excuses *ICH*-6 which we hear *T*-5 from some that all the required development projects , which *T*-7 in turn will make <COREF ID="1__8" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> and the citizen happy , lacked liquidity , and other excuses , such as the public debt and other acceptable and unacceptable excuses .
This year there is no excuse for anyone , especially <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">Abu Matab -LRB- may God protect <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF> -RRB- , who *T*-1 was harsh with <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">the ministers</COREF> and demanded work and accomplishment from <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> after *PRO*-2 offering to each minister what he needed *T*-3</COREF> .
Because we are still in the first months , it *EXP*-1 became a duty *PRO* to monitor this ministry by many authorities , not only the Surveillance Authority .
Rather , <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">this budget</COREF> requires <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT">the creation of <COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">a ministry concerned with monitoring and surveillance , and consequently *PRO* holding accountable</COREF></COREF> .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="2__23" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> creation</COREF> happen with <COREF ID="2__28" TYPE="IDENT">the new cabinet formation in particular</COREF> , so <COREF ID="2__28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> enjoys a commitment of transparency and accountability .
How nice it would be *T*-1 if the strategy of <COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">this surveillance authority</COREF> were centered *-2 around the following question : where will <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> be spent *-3 *T*-4 after *PRO* programming the spending mechanisms and reviewing plans and programs and projects for which <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">this major budget</COREF> was allocated *-5 *T*-6 ?
And how nice it would be *T*-1 if <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> disbursement were scheduled *-2 according to the duration of <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT">projects</COREF> and the method of <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> implementation provided that at the end of each year it presents an estimated budget for the coming year along with a review of what *T*-4 was spent *-5 from the previous budget , which *T*-6 of course will not be spent *-7 all in one year , because <COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">some major projects</COREF> can not be completed *-8 in one year and need several years so we can see <COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in the land of reality .
Through this mechanism no ministry will be allowed *-1 to ask annually for an increase in <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> budget if <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't submit a report showing where and how of <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">the money</COREF> was spent *-2 *T*-3 .
If the projects are not completed *-1 during the year , then *PRO* let <COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="IDENT">the current budget</COREF> , or the remaining part of <COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , be carried *-2 forward , until these projects for which <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">this large budget</COREF> was allocated *-3 *T*-4 are completed *-5 .
And *PRO* let some of the tasks of <COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">this ministry which we hope 0 *T*-1 will be established *-2</COREF> be *PRO* monitoring all this and taking severely to task any ministry that *T*-3 hoards one budget after another while *PRO*-4 releasing a lot of news about which we do not see any reality *T*-5 on the ground , as <COREF ID="2__98" TYPE="IDENT">our wise government</COREF> and our citizens wanted *?* .
We are all -LRB- in concern <COREF ID="2__104" TYPE="IDENT">a country</COREF> -RRB- , and despite differences in our inclinations and desires , we all love and are concerned about <COREF ID="2__104" TYPE="IDENT">this homeland</COREF> .
The Saudi family under <COREF ID="2__124" TYPE="IDENT">the leadership of <COREF ID="2__98" TYPE="IDENT">our wise government</COREF></COREF> has every right *PRO* to monitor *RNR*-1 , hold to account *RNR*-1 , and control *RNR*-1 the implementation of projects .
National responsibility demands that we workers in the three types of mass media -- *PRO* watched *-1 , listened to *-1 , and read *-1 -- demand that <COREF ID="2__124" TYPE="IDENT">the leadership</COREF> have a suitable entourage , and <COREF ID="2__124" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> follow up <COREF ID="2__127" TYPE="IDENT">all cases of deficiency and dereliction</COREF> and forcefully point <COREF ID="2__127" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> out so that the negligent people will not be negligent and the sloppy people will not be sloppy .

<TEXT PARTNO="001">
In that way we will monitor <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">all the groundbreaking achievements which these ministries also make *T*-1</COREF> , and shed light on <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> while *PRO*-2 presenting positive media support .
With such monitoring and care , we serve <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> treasures , first among which is *T*-1 the Saudi people .
Through this , we serve the interests of <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> government , which *T*-1 this year <COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">released</COREF> <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">the largest budget in more than 30 years</COREF> ,
<COREF ID="1__25" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is clear evidence that <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> not being drained *-3 financially and not suffering human losses in various wars has provided <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">our country</COREF> with a budget like <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">this one</COREF> which *T*-1 will be spent *-2 on the redevelopment of <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sons in all aspects of life .
Although <COREF ID="1__42" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">the masters</COREF> -- <COREF ID="1__43" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the residents of the White House</COREF> --</COREF> monitored <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> budget</COREF> and had hopes for <COREF ID="1__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> -- the evidence for that is <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">Rice 's</COREF> *ICH*-1 visit , who *T*-2 stopped in the Middle East after a recommendation by <COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Tom Lantos</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__56" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the U. S. House of Representatives</COREF> , who *T*-3 set up an accountability session for <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> and the Republican team working with <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> *PRO* to discuss <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">Bush 's</COREF> new crumbling strategy -LRB- which <COREF ID="1__42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> called *T*-4 *PRO*-5 " escalating " -RRB- , in which a lot of America 's money and children will be spent *-6 *T*-7</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT">Tom</COREF> asked <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">Rice</COREF> , " Why do , <COREF ID="1__75" TYPE="IDENT">the countries of <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">the Arabian Gulf</COREF></COREF> pay *T*-1 ? " .
<COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> did not forget *PRO*-1 to have <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">Egypt</COREF> also offer <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> sons as an alternative to the American soldiers , *PRO*-1 claiming that what *T*-2 is happening in <COREF ID="1__82" TYPE="IDENT">Iraq</COREF> is <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">a civil war</COREF> , and if <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">this civil war</COREF> continues , the first ones 0 *T*-3 to be harmed *-4 will be <COREF ID="1__75" TYPE="IDENT">the countries of <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">the Arabian Gulf</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__42" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> arrogance is amazing .
Are <COREF ID="1__42" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> not pleased that <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> economic condition has recovered and God has favored <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> with this abundant good ?
We will witness the mechanisms of bargaining after the arrival of <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">the well - regarded Rice who *T*-1 certainly visited <COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">the occupying entity</COREF> and arranged a new game *ICH*-3 with <COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> called * *PRO*-2 the establishment of a new Palestinian state *PRO* to entice us *PRO*-4 to support <COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> materially and morally</COREF> .
It *EXP*-1 is worth *PRO* mentioning that in <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> speech <COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">Bush</COREF> criticized the government of <COREF ID="1__113" TYPE="IDENT">al - Maliki</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__67" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was followed *-1 by <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">Rice with the same tone and language during <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> last meeting with <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> colleague the Zionist foreign minister where <COREF ID="1__52" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> criticized <COREF ID="1__113" TYPE="IDENT">al - Maliki , who *T*-2 is expected *-3 to be relieved *-4 of <COREF ID="1__113" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> post as another step 0 *T*-5 to entice <COREF ID="1__82" TYPE="IDENT">the Iraq 's</COREF> neighboring countries , <COREF ID="1__131" TYPE="IDENT">specifically those who *T*-6 crave <COREF ID="1__133" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__82" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> budget surplus</COREF> *PRO* to spend <COREF ID="1__133" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> on <COREF ID="1__131" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> mistakes and adventures in power</COREF></COREF> *T*-7</COREF> .
They are , unfortunately , steps which *T*-1 find those who *T*-2 follow <COREF ID="1__142" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , monitor <COREF ID="1__142" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , scrutinize <COREF ID="1__142" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , and document <COREF ID="1__142" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in this article .
*PRO* Let us return once more to <COREF ID="1__151" TYPE="IDENT">the accountability of ministries</COREF> .
By <COREF ID="1__151" TYPE="IDENT">this means</COREF> , we can hold companies accountable because we can not ask any particular ministry *PRO*-1 to monitor *RNR*-2 , hold to account *RNR*-2 , and make answerable *RNR*-2 the public and private companies .
The ministry has nothing 0 *PRO* to do *T*-1 with prosecution .
If the condition of <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">ministries</COREF> is good , the condition of the companies that *T*-1 follow <COREF ID="2__2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be good .
This confirms that partnership between the public and private sectors which we are always demanding *T*-1 will not come into being unless we hold everyone accountable and all parties agree *PRO*-2 to serve <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> with the instructions of the noble Book and the honored Sunna of the Prophet .
In conclusion : It is now time 0 *PRO* to sit together at the table of <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> *T*-1 .
The heart of <COREF ID="1__11" TYPE="IDENT">the country</COREF> is wider than all the places in the universe .

No seminars *ICH*-2 are held *-1 calling for the accountability of <COREF ID="2__66" TYPE="IDENT">the ministries</COREF> because <COREF ID="2__66" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are simply answerable originally .
<COREF ID="2__66" TYPE="IDENT">Their</COREF> violation of the principles of accountability which *T*-1 are part of the nature of governmental work is nothing but a deviation from the normal course , and a deformation of the position 0 it should be in *T*-2 .
