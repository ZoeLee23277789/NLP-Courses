Plain sentence:
---------------
    He offered a number of suggestions to the Ministry of Finance and officials to help the companies, namely : to allow
    companies to buy their shares immediately which would give trust in the market and would reduce the number of dealt in
    shares on the market and thus increase the amount of profit ; to allow non-Saudi companies and corporations to enter the
    market by placing controls such as instituting sectors for shares and an ownership percentage ceiling ; and to oblige
    companies to disclose future expectations of the companies ' performances.

    It is not possible to believe that Al-Waleed had been " only " collecting since last March-LRB-almost a year
    ago-RRB-until now. Because, if that had happened, then the rates of his prices would be much higher than the current
    prices.
