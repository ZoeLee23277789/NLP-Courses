    And how nice it would be if its disbursement were scheduled according to the duration of projects and the method of
    their implementation provided that at the end of each year it presents an estimated budget for the coming year along
    with a review of what was spent from the previous budget, which of course will not be spent all in one year, because
    some major projects can not be completed in one year and need several years so we can see it in the land of reality.

Plain sentence:

    Although the masters--the residents of the White House--monitored our budget and had hopes for it--the evidence for that
    is Rice's visit, who stopped in the Middle East after a recommendation by Tom Lantos, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs
    Committee in the U. S. House of Representatives, who set up an accountability session for her and the Republican team
    working with her to discuss Bush's new crumbling strategy-LRB-which they called " escalating "-RRB-, in which a lot of
    America's money and children will be spent.
