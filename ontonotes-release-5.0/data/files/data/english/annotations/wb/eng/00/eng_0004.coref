The <COREF ID="1__0" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street Journal</COREF> editorial page this morning has praised `` <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">a gang of conservative GOP members in the general assembly</COREF> '' for *PRO*-1 <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">foiling</COREF> <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__23" TYPE="IDENT">Gov. Timothy M. Kaine 's</COREF> taxes - for - transportation plan</COREF> .
`` <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E1" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> was a victory against long odds , because <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">the renegade <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">house</COREF> members</COREF> were lined *-1 up against the Governor , powerful Republicans in the state senate , elements of the business community and <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> largely pro-tax media . ''
<COREF ID="1__0" TYPE="IDENT">The Journal</COREF> cited <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> revenue surplus as a major reason why voters never warmed to <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the tax - hike idea</COREF> *T*-1 , and noted that it *EXP*-3 did n't help that <COREF ID="1__23" TYPE="IDENT">Kaine</COREF> was trying *PRO*-2 to raise gasoline taxes amidst soaring retail prices at the pump .
<COREF ID="1__27" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> wonder how <COREF ID="1__0" TYPE="IDENT">the Journal</COREF> would interpret news *ICH*-1 from <COREF ID="1__44" TYPE="IDENT">the Washington Post</COREF> today that <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">Del. David B. Albo , R - Springfield</COREF> and a number of other GOP delegates would like *PRO*-2 to raise an estimated $ 400 million *U* a year from Northern <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> 0 *T*-3 to spend on local road and rail projects *T*-4 .
`` Roads cost money , '' <COREF ID="1__44" TYPE="IDENT">the Post</COREF> quotes <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">Albo</COREF> as *PRO* saying *T*-1 .
`` <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd love *PRO*-1 to find a way 0 *PRO* to pay for the things 0 we need *T*-2 *T*-3 by *PRO* not raising taxes and using existing revenue ,
but <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm a realist . ''
While most GOP delegates were willing *PRO*-1 to hang together *PRO*-2 to oppose a statewide tax increase , there seems *-3 to be little appreciation of the root causes of transportation dysfunction in <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> .
Oh , sure , you 've got yer Bill Howell talking about tolls and privatization ,
and you 've got yer Tim Hugo backing telework ,
and <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF> did pass some marginally useful legislation dealing with VDOT and land use ,
but deep down inside , in <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> heart of hearts , <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">most delegates</COREF> share the assumption *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> counterparts in the state Senate that the cause of traffic congestion is insufficient transportation capacity .
The disagreement is over how much money <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> can afford *PRO*-1 to raise *T*-2 *PRO*-3 to pay for improvements .
Personally , <COREF ID="1__27" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 it 's a bit too early for anyone to proclaim a `` victory . ''
Yes , <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">the House</COREF> has temporarily beat back proposals for some $ 1 billion *U* in tax increases .
But *PRO* simply starving the current , broken transportation system of funds is n't going *-1 to solve anything .
<COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">The House</COREF> , along with everyone else , needs *-1 to get on with the business of *PRO* re-thinking transportation fundamentals .
Otherwise , <COREF ID="1__68" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 'll end up like <COREF ID="1__45" TYPE="IDENT">Dave Albo</COREF> , *PRO* promoting tax increases through the back door .
The business of *PRO* re-thinking transportation fundamentals then testing , validating , and implementing the results of all that thinking is going *-1 to take longer and cost more than what they have saved *T*-2 by *PRO* starving the current system of funds .
It *EXP*-2 is going *-1 to take much more than a billion dollars in tax increases *PRO* to achieve any alternative plan , and then the alternative may turn out *-3 to be like the inter-county connector :
that is , the same old plan only 50 years later .
In the meantime , we still suffer under the costs of <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">the congestion tax</COREF> , for which we get nothing in return *T*-1 ,
and the costs of any action , whether alternative or traditional continues *-1 to go up .
In the end we are going *-1 to be coming around to the back door like beggars ,
but the alms will be around $ 4 billion *U* instead of one .
Yeah , <COREF ID="1__27" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd say 0 it was too early *PRO* to claim victory .
Jim : *PRO* Thank <COREF ID="1__27" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> for *PRO*-1 recognizing the problem .
`` But *PRO* simply starving the current , broken transportation system of funds is n't going *-1 to solve anything .
The House , along with everyone else , needs *-1 to get on with the business of *PRO* re-thinking transportation fundamentals . ''
Your `` but deep down inside , in <COREF ID="2__43" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> heart of hearts , <COREF ID="2__43" TYPE="IDENT">most delegates</COREF> share the assumption *ICH*-1 of <COREF ID="2__43" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> counterparts in <COREF ID="2__47" TYPE="IDENT">the state Senate</COREF> that the cause of traffic congestion is insufficient transportation capacity . '' is challenged *-2 by the Post report on the view of <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">the leaders in <COREF ID="2__47" TYPE="IDENT">the Senate</COREF></COREF>
<COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> say 0 <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> less populated regions are also in desperate need of better roads *PRO* to draw jobs and reverse economic decline .
Until our leaders recognize that the role of transportation is limited to *PRO*-2 being economic enabler , and not an economic driver we will be locked *-1 in to the current funding stalemate .
*PRO* Spending taxpayer dollars on transportation *PRO* to `` draw jobs and reverse economic decline '' is like *PRO* pushing on a rope .
*PRO* Reducing the costs of <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">the congestion tax</COREF> is the only way 0 *PRO* to advance the <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> 's economy *T*-1 .
And yet 90 % of <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-000-E3" TYPE="IDENT">the state 's</COREF> roads are uncongested 90 % of the time
and 45 % of all travel happens on and during the other 10 % .
How hard *ICH*-1 is this *T*-2 0 *PRO* to figure *T*-3 out , really ?
Traffic congestion is less during recessions , and some cities would willingly trade high unemployment rates for congestion .
Traffic congestion becomes self - correcting when businesses choose *PRO*-1 to leave <COREF ID="2__93" TYPE="IDENT">an area</COREF> because <COREF ID="2__93" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is too crowded and plagued by delays *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="2__96" TYPE="IDENT">Politicians</COREF> want the growth that *T*-1 brings <COREF ID="2__100" TYPE="IDENT">congestion</COREF> , yet <COREF ID="2__96" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> also want *PRO*-2 to control or reduce <COREF ID="2__100" TYPE="IDENT">that congestion</COREF> .
</TEXT>
<TEXT PARTNO="001">
They refuse *PRO*-1 to implement effective strategies 0 *T*-2 to relieve congestion because the stringent solutions required * might , like congestion itself , redirect growth to other areas .
This is not a new problem .
Rome restricted deliveries to night time because the carts made the streets dangerous , but night deliveries interrupted sleep .
London had parking restrictions in the 1600's .
Affordable public transportation was developed *-1 *PRO* to ease the overcrowding and polllution that *T*-2 prevailed before .
Zoning was developed *-1 in New York *PRO* to encourage people *-2 to move out of the city center , *PRO*-2 subsidized *-3 by flat fares on the trolleys .
Later , trolley tracks became jammed with trolleys and the system became overcrowded .
When roads began *-1 to take over from railroads *T*-2 , the problem soon became obvious :
`` None of <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> should delude <COREF ID="1__37" TYPE="IDENT">ourselves</COREF> , however , that the road problem of <COREF ID="2__75" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> ... will be solved *-1 at least for many years .
<COREF ID="1__41" TYPE="IDENT">Those who *T*-1 use the roads</COREF> will demand wider , smoother and safer roads due to <COREF ID="1__41" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> increasing use and the consequent congestion on the highways . '' -
Governor Harry Byrd , 1930 State of the Commonwealth
Whether you call *PRO* *PRO*-1 Smart Growth , Transit oriented design , New Urbanism , pedestrian Oriented Communities or what have you *T*-2 , the end result of higher densities will be <COREF ID="1__60" TYPE="IDENT">more congestion in more localized places</COREF> .
We might be able *PRO*-1 to alleviate some of <COREF ID="1__60" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> by *PRO*-3 <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">creating</COREF> a transit system that *T*-2 is 20 times as dense as we have ,
but I doubt 0 we have the economic stomach for <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-002-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , either , particularly since that style of living is likely *PRO*-1 to attract only 15 % of the population .
<COREF ID="1__75" TYPE="IDENT">Planners and environmentalists</COREF> are disingenuous when <COREF ID="1__75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> urge us *PRO*-1 to fight congestion through smart growth *T*-2 .
Politicians at heart , <COREF ID="1__75" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> really want more congested environments -LRB- for everyone else -RRB- but presumably want <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">that congestion</COREF> to be somehow managed and accommodated *-1 .
If <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is not accommodated *-1 , people will start *-2 to move to the suburbs specifically *PRO* to avoid congestion .
As George will put it , `` The purpose of ' smart ' ' coordinated ' growth is *PRO* to prevent <COREF ID="1__94" TYPE="IDENT">the masses</COREF> , in <COREF ID="1__94" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> freedom , from *PRO*-1 producing democracy 's byproducts -- untidiness and even vulgarity .
And the bland notion of ' planning ' often is the rubric under which <COREF ID="1__103" TYPE="IDENT">government</COREF> operates *T*-1 when *PRO* making <COREF ID="1__103" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> preferences and prophecies -- often meaning <COREF ID="1__103" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> arrogance and <COREF ID="1__103" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> mistakes -- mandatory *T*-2 . ''
So , it *EXP*-1 's not all that hard *PRO* to push <COREF ID="1__113" TYPE="IDENT">a rope</COREF> - you just need *-2 to freeze <COREF ID="1__113" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> first .
but anyone that *T*-1 thinks 0 any of this is going *-2 to be solved *-3 , by whatever means , without lots and lots of money needs *-4 to go Back to square one .
<COREF ID="2__0" TYPE="IDENT">Jim</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ask , what is victory *T*-1 ?
For <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">the Dems</COREF> , either <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">no transportation deal</COREF> or a comprehensive one is victory , <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">the former</COREF> because <COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> imporves the electoral landscape in <COREF ID="2__11" TYPE="IDENT">'07</COREF> .
For <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">the GOP</COREF> , something akin to what <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were proposing *T*-1 may seem *-2 to be a victory to <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , but more likely a victory for <COREF ID="2__3" TYPE="IDENT">the Dems</COREF> because voters wo n't see any benefit by <COREF ID="2__11" TYPE="IDENT">'07</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="2__0" TYPE="IDENT">Jim</COREF> , is it a victory solely if taxes are n't raised *-1 ?
<COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">Bob</COREF> , No , <COREF ID="2__0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would n't define victory as *PRO* simply not raising taxes -- although <COREF ID="2__0" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> definitely would like *PRO*-1 to defer *PRO* raising taxes as long as prudently possible .
To <COREF ID="2__0" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , victory would be winning the acknowledgement *ICH*-1 of a critical mass of <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">the General Assembly</COREF> that the solution to traffic congestion is not just raising taxes / adding capacity .
A rational approach to transportation would entail -LRB- 1 -RRB- *PRO* creating communities with a mix of housing / office / retail / amenities *PRO* to reduce the number and length of automobile trips , -LRB- 2 -RRB- *PRO* reforming counterproductive zoning codes , subdivision ordinances and comprehensive plans in order *PRO* to create more transit - friendly and pedestrian - friendly communities , -LRB- 3 -RRB- *PRO* creating funding sources for transportation that *T*-1 establishes a rational nexus between those who *T*-2 use *RNR*-4 / benefit from *RNR*-4 <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">transportation facilities</COREF> and those who *T*-3 pay for <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , -LRB- 4 -RRB- *PRO* promoting telework , -LRB- 5 -RRB- *PRO* liberating mass transit from government monopolies and encouraging private sector innovation , -LRB- 6 -RRB- *PRO* using a wide range of tools , from corridor management to intelligent transportation systems , *PRO* to increase the capacity of existing thoroughfares , -LRB- 7 -RRB- *PRO* stretching the value of road construction / maintenance dollars through outsourcing , and -LRB- 8 -RRB- *PRO* prioritizing transportation projects on a congestion - mitigation Return on Investment basis .
<COREF ID="2__75" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> has started *-1 tinkering with a number of <COREF ID="2__77" TYPE="IDENT">these</COREF> , but has not systematically explored any of <COREF ID="2__77" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
Until <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">the General Assembly</COREF> gets serious about fundamental change , we can not declare victory -- no matter how high / low taxes and raised / cut *-1 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">Bob</COREF> - with all due respect , <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> 're blowing smoke .
<COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">Most people in NoVA</COREF> want an adequate public facilities ordinance and do n't believe that anything related * to transportation <COREF ID="2__98" TYPE="IDENT">is</COREF> anything more than another way 0 *PRO* to foster more development *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="2__89" TYPE="IDENT">THey</COREF> believed <COREF ID="2__98" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> in 2002 and still do today .
People voted for <COREF ID="2__102" TYPE="IDENT">Tim Kaine</COREF> because many of us truly believed <COREF ID="2__102" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> statement that `` enough was enough . ''
Many of us saw <COREF ID="2__102" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> very modest proposal *PRO* to postpone development where the roads could not handle today 's traffic *T*-1 as a small step towards APF .
-LRB- <COREF ID="2__102" TYPE="IDENT">Kaine</COREF> made <COREF ID="2__102" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> `` promise '' with full knowledge of the power of the builders in <COREF ID="2__75" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> . -RRB-
Yet , once *PRO* confronted *-1 with the expected opposition , <COREF ID="2__102" TYPE="IDENT">Kaine</COREF> did a 180 and joined the other side --
`` *PRO* pay more , so we can develop more . ''

There are quite a few good Democrats , Independents and Republicans who *T*-1 now believe that <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">Tim Kaine</COREF> has joined the dark side .

This is not *-1 to argue that the GOP is sitting any better .

It might reduce the number and length of some car trips ,
but it will result in more localized congestion , and maybe even more congestion overall .
*PRO* <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Reducing</COREF> the number of trips is NOT ordinarily a rational approach to transportation , although <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could be in some limited cases .
-LRB- 3 -RRB- <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have no problem with *T*-1 , except that even non-users benefit from roads , so it ca n't be totally user driven .
-LRB- 4 -RRB- <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> agree with *T*-1 and support *T*-1 , however we may have already sucked much of the juice out of that orange

If you accomplish -LRB- 5 -RRB- You will effectively eliminate much of mass transit , unless you have privately operated but subsidized mass transit .
This is a recipe for pork , payola , and patronage .
-LRB- 6 -RRB- *PRO* <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">Increasing</COREF> the capacity of existing thoroughfares is a waste since 90 % of our roads are underused *-1 90 % of the time .
<COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-004-E2" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is also an admission that <COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">-LRB- 1 -RRB-</COREF> is insufficient .

It is OK so far as it goes ,
but the likely market for the market created * by such zoning might only be 15 % of the population .
What it leaves *T*-1 out is what *T*-2 happens to everybody else , who *T*-3 happens *-4 not to be in an area designated * for transit friendly development .
Are <COREF ID="2__0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> also willing *PRO*-1 to also reform counterproductive zoning codes that *T*-2 requires people *PRO*-3 to stay in the business of farming , for example ?
If more density is good for some areas , why not all ?
<COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know 0 <COREF ID="2__0" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> answer will be that <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">those people</COREF> should be allowed *-1 to live where <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> please *?* *T*-2 as long as <COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> pay <COREF ID="2__15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__12" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> full locational costs</COREF> .
But we can already see that <COREF ID="2__15" TYPE="IDENT">those costs</COREF> are subject to maipulation :
people whose costs *T*-1 include *PRO* supporting the Dulles Toll road are also supporting the transit that *T*-2 will make it *EXP*-3 possible for <COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">future residents</COREF> to live in transit friendly neighborhoods .
Whatever *T*-1 happened to <COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">THEM</COREF> paying <COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> full locational costs ?
Transit is going *-1 to require massive and widespread subsidies *PRO*-2 to even partially work .
Here , again , some allowance *ICH*-3 needs *-1 to be made *-2 for the idea that transit provides some limited benefit to non-users .
So , <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">those people who *T*-1 are left *-2 out</COREF> will be expected *-3 to pay for the transit that *T*-4 helps *PRO* make those included * in development areas possible .
At the same time <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> will likely be excluded *-1 from increasing density even when it is to <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> benefit *T*-2 -LRB- <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may live next to those 90 % of roads that *T*-3 are underutilized *-4 -RRB- .
<COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> will be done *-1 partially in order *PRO* to artificially create the demand required * *PRO*-2 to fill the designated areas , and the cover story will be that <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is for the environment , *PRO* to save prime farmland , etc.
<COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> amounts to *PRO* disingenuously making certain preferences and prophesies mandatory ,

When <COREF ID="2__62" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> does systematically explore these ideas *T*-1 <COREF ID="2__62" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may very well come to <COREF ID="2__65" TYPE="IDENT">the conclusion that Fundamental Change is a really lousy idea , and that , *PRO* bad as it is *?* , business as usual is the best option after all</COREF> .
The main reson 0 <COREF ID="2__62" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are likely *PRO*-1 to reach <COREF ID="2__65" TYPE="IDENT">that conclusion</COREF> *T*-2 is that the costs for all this theoretical thinking and experimental development is going *-3 to be far higher than the money 0 we `` saved '' *T*-4 on <COREF ID="2__79" TYPE="IDENT">transportation</COREF> by *PRO* not providing <COREF ID="2__79" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> see what <COREF ID="2__82" TYPE="IDENT">TMT</COREF> says *T*-1 as the other side of the same coin 0 <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> described *T*-2 above .

Will Rogers once joked that if you wanted *PRO*-1 to cure traffic congestion , *PRO* just make <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> pay cash for <COREF ID="1__3" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cars up front .
The APF idea is the same kind of joke .
None of <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">the development 0 we have *T*-1</COREF> was built *-2 when the facilities were adequate *T*-3 , and much of <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was built *-4 specifically *PRO* to get away from places that *T*-5 had inadequate facilities and were over built .

<COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0004.part-006-E1" TYPE="IDENT">This last</COREF> creates a real problem and hardship because <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">existing residents</COREF> have no way 0 *PRO* to capitalize on <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> fortune *T*-1 unless <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> move .
But if the APF's are disproportionately applied *-1 , then there wo n't be any place 0 *PRO* to move to *T*-2 .
In that case the benefits and disbenefits of APF's cancel each other out ,
and there is no reason 0 *PRO* to implement what *T*-1 is a lousy idea 0 *PRO* to begin with *T*-3 *T*-2 .
I do n't have online access to <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">the WSJ</COREF> , but did <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> really refer to the `` general assembling '' and did <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> also fault <COREF ID="1__74" TYPE="IDENT">Kaine</COREF> for *PRO* `` trying *PRO*-1 to raise gasoline taxes ? ''
If so , does <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">the WSJ</COREF> have a fact checker on staff ?
Once we 're done with this doomed debate , we can move on *PRO*-1 to contemplate the doubled energy prices 0 we can all expect *T*-2 when we get *PRO*-3 to enjoy the full benefits of a deregulated electricity market in a couple years *T*-4 .
Hmmm --
double the cost of juice and hopelessly clogged roads .
Will the last ones out `` free market '' Virginia please turn out the lights on your way to North Carolina ?
Not Grover , Thanks for *PRO* catching <COREF ID="1__100" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> typo</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have corrected <COREF ID="1__100" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
And that 's a good point about <COREF ID="1__74" TYPE="IDENT">Kaine 's</COREF> `` gasoline tax . ''
There has been so much back and forth that <COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't remember every permutation of every tax plan .
But was not the point of both the <COREF ID="1__74" TYPE="IDENT">Kaine</COREF> and the Senate tax plans *PRO* to NOT tax gasoline at the pump -- indeed to tax anything but gasoline at the pump ?
In that case , <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">the WSJ</COREF> got <COREF ID="1__70" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> information very wrong .
Yesterday as <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was cruising along at below traffic speed but still 65 in 55 a tow truck passed <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> like <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was sitting still .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was running at least 75 and maybe more .
<COREF ID="2__5" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> was towing a school bus .
That kind of behavior makes you think 0 there might be some value in Albo 's plan *PRO* to increase fines for really bad drivers , especially since almost a third of traffic cogestion is caused *-1 by incidents .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have long held that fines for <COREF ID="2__27" TYPE="IDENT">professional drivers</COREF> should be tripled *-1 -
<COREF ID="2__27" TYPE="IDENT">these guys</COREF> should know better .
<COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">Jim</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> agree with most of <COREF ID="2__32" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> proposals</COREF> , or at least the goals 0 <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> hope *PRO*-1 to achieve *T*-2 with <COREF ID="2__32" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
But <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> am suspicious of the outsourcing and private partnerships .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd rather reform public entities because private entities require a level of cost 0 public ones should n't *?* *T*-1 -- profit .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> agree with <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">Ray</COREF> that even non-users of <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">transportation facilities</COREF> benefit from <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> , but <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do favor higher gas taxes and other directly related user fees .
And with <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">congestion</COREF> the way 0 <COREF ID="2__55" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is *T*-1 , *PRO* building roads to nowhere in the hopes of *PRO* fostering economic development may not be feasible .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">Ray</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm surprised 0 <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> think 0 we ca n't do more teleworking .
*PRO* Seems 0 we have many opportunities *PRO* to expand it .
But overall , *PRO* demanding such reforms before *PRO* expanding capacity simply wo n't work in the real world .
First , we 'll need *-1 to reform American capitalism itself , *PRO* eliminating the public supported breaks 0 we give *T*-2 to <COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="IDENT">business , whether <COREF ID="2__78" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> be home developers , road builders , or farmers</COREF> , as well as homeowners , i.e. , interest rate deductions .
Bottom line is 0 we need more capacity and land use reform .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> interest is the politics of it .
Which *T*-1 brings <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> back to the same question , asked * in that context :
How do you judge when the reforms 0 you want *T*-1 are sufficient *PRO* to invest more in *PRO* increasing capacity *T*-2 *T*-3 ?
<COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">Jim</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> may have a clear vision in <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">your</COREF> head about what that threshold is *T*-1 ,
but <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E7" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> sense from the SmartGrowth folks and anti-taxers who *T*-1 make many of the same arguements 0 <COREF ID="2__1" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> do *T*-2 that any amount of reform will never be enough .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 EMR convinced <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> that those that *T*-1 really can telework already do so .
There are a lot of people for whom it does not apply *T*-1 , retail , mechanics , etc.
There is more 0 we can do *T*-1 on telework ,
but <COREF ID="2__128" TYPE="IDENT">Ed</COREF> suggests 0 the well is not as deep as we would like *PRO*-1 to believe .
Then again , it runs counter *RNR*-2 or provides impetus that *T*-1 is counter *RNR*-2 to <COREF ID="2__128" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> other ideas .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was formerly more optimistic ,
but in this case <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> found <COREF ID="2__128" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> argument persuasive .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm open to more hard data , and <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0004.part-007.aif-E6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> believe 0 the biggest hindrance is organizational , not technical .

<TEXT PARTNO="004">
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ray_Hyde">I</COREF> favor higher gas taxes and user fees , too , but not exclusively because we all have a stake in roads .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ray_Hyde">I</COREF> would make the same argument for transit :
it *EXP*-1 is OK for the general public or auto drivers -LRB- which *T*-2 is much the same thing -RRB- to provide some support for transit because there is <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">some -LRB- small -RRB- benefit to everyone for those that *T*-3 are able and willing *PRO*-4 to use Metro etc.</COREF>
On the other hand , once we understand how small <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">that benefit</COREF> really is *T*-1 we might decide 0 <COREF ID="21" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's just not worth it ,
and we should let <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">the thing</COREF> be privatized *-1 where <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> works *T*-2 and disappear where <COREF ID="32" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does n't *?* *T*-3 .
<COREF ID="48" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ray_Hyde">I</COREF> 'm with you .
We can not take hard lines on every issue and make progress in any direction .
Unfortunately , for some , <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">strategic stalemate</COREF> is just as good as any other means of conservation , *PRO* never mind whatever other harm <COREF ID="43" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> does *T*-1 .
