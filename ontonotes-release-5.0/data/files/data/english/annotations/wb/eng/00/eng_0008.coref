*PRO* Learning from the Swedes
Reader Rob Jackson calls attention to an article in <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">today 's Wall Street Journal</COREF> about <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">the experiment in <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">Stockholm</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Sweden</COREF></COREF> , with congestion pricing</COREF> .
It seems that <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">the Swedes</COREF> , for all <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> skill in urban planning and <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> investments in mass transit , are suffering from traffic congestion .
Better yet , <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> 're adopting a market - driven remedy .
Socialist though <COREF ID="1__12" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> may be *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Sweden 's</COREF> politicians apparently have a firmer grasp of economics than <COREF ID="1__27" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia 's</COREF> .
The Greater <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">Stockholm</COREF> region has nearly two million people .
<COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">The central city</COREF> , *PRO*-1 built *-2 upon an archipelago of islands linked * by bridges , is particularly prone to congestion .
Under contract with IBM , the national government has set up 23 tolling points which *T*-1 , *PRO*-2 used *-3 in conjunction with transponder boxes , laser detectors and cameras , tracks the path of every car in <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> .
Each time 0 a car with a transponder passes through a toll *T*-1 , the charge is automatically deducted *-2 from the driver 's bank account .
Tolls vary at different times of the day according to the level of congestion , *PRO*-1 ranging from the equivalent of $ 1.38 *U* *RNR*-2 to $ 2.76 *U* *RNR*-2 per hour .
The goal was *PRO* to <COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">alter</COREF> motorist behavior -- and <COREF ID="1__64" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's exactly what *T*-1 has happened .
Rather than *PRO* drive to and from work at the same time every day , <COREF ID="1__69" TYPE="IDENT">some Stockholmites -LRB- Stockholmers ? -RRB-</COREF> are varying <COREF ID="1__69" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> commuting times .
Some are taking different routes .
Some are riding bicycles .
And <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">many</COREF> are availing <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> of mass transit .
As <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">the WSJ</COREF> explains *?* : Before <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">the trial</COREF> began , <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">Stockholm</COREF> spent about $ 180 million *U* on <COREF ID="1__85" TYPE="IDENT">improvements to public transportation</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> bought about 200 new buses and added rush - hour trains , express bus routes and more *PRO* park - and - ride lots .
But <COREF ID="1__85" TYPE="IDENT">the changes</COREF> had little impact on the number of <COREF ID="1__96" TYPE="IDENT">people who *T*-1 left <COREF ID="1__96" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> private cars at home</COREF> .
In spring 2006 , however , during <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">the trial</COREF> , use of all forms of public transportation jumped 6 % and ridership on inner - city bus routes rose 9 % , compared with a year earlier .
Now that <COREF ID="1__6" TYPE="IDENT">the six - month trial</COREF> has ended , <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">the city</COREF> has scheduled a referendum *PRO* to let voters decide whether *PRO* to make <COREF ID="1__114" TYPE="IDENT">the congestion - pricing scheme</COREF> permanent .
A June poll found that 52 percent of voters favored <COREF ID="1__114" TYPE="IDENT">the plan</COREF> .
So far , the idea of congestion pricing in <COREF ID="1__27" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> has n't gotten past the talking stage .
Oh yeah -- a system that *T*-1 tracks every car 's movements through transponders will go over with the public in <COREF ID="1__27" TYPE="IDENT">Va</COREF> .
There remain <COREF ID="1__129" TYPE="IDENT">people who *T*-1 wo n't buy smarttags because <COREF ID="1__129" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do n't want Big Brother *ICH*-2 to have the data -LRB- or <COREF ID="1__129" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> spouse 's divorce lawyer</COREF> . -RRB-
It *EXP*-1 strikes me as remarkable that our transportation policies are more socialistic than <COREF ID="1__9" TYPE="IDENT">Sweden 's</COREF> .
We wo n't do photo red , and you are suggesting this ?
<COREF ID="1__145" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anonymous">Anonymous</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__146" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jim_Bacon">I</COREF> do n't believe that the Swedish system requires people *PRO*-1 to <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">install</COREF> transponders .
Some people will prefer <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">that option</COREF> because <COREF ID="2__7" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's more convenient .
<COREF ID="1__146" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Jim_Bacon">Jim</COREF> : WaPo ran the <COREF ID="1__5" TYPE="IDENT">Wall Street Journal</COREF> story on D 5 of Business .
<COREF ID="1__145" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Anonymous">Anonymous 11:06</COREF> *PRO* see our comment yesterday re anonymity .
<COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">Citizens</COREF> can have functional transport , functional settlement patterns , functional governance and a sustainable civilization ;
Or <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> can , *PRO*-1 to protect cheating husbands and wives and others for whom secrecty is a way 0 *PRO* to preserve special privilage *T*-2 *T*-3 , obsess over private rights to the exclusion of public responsibilities .
EMR
By all accounts <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">Stockholm</COREF> experiment</COREF> has been <COREF ID="2__37" TYPE="IDENT">a success</COREF> , so far .
Three issues come to mind .
First , <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">Stockholm</COREF> spent <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="IDENT">$ 180 million *U*</COREF> on transportation improvements before <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">the experiment</COREF> .
Would <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">the experiment</COREF> have been as successful if <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> had not spent <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="IDENT">the money</COREF> ?
Was <COREF ID="2__37" TYPE="IDENT">the `` success ''</COREF> a manufactured result 0 *T*-1 to cover up for the previously failed investment ?
Second , <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">Stockholm</COREF> had the presence of mind and the fairness of government *PRO* to put <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> together as an experiment , and <COREF ID="2__62" TYPE="IDENT">allow</COREF> <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">the citizens</COREF> to dismantle <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> later if <COREF ID="2__58" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> thought <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> not worthwhile .
<COREF ID="2__62" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is an admirable approach ,
what US government has *T*-1 ever incorporated <COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">a policy</COREF> as a test and THEN put <COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> up for referendum ?
One of our problems is that *PRO* having made <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">a mistake</COREF> , it *EXP*-1 is impossible *PRO* to get the government to own up to <COREF ID="2__70" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Where is the referendum on whether we should spend umpteen billion on the Tyson 's project *T*-1 ?
Focus groups and special interests do n't count .
Third , *PRO* granted *-1 , the government in <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">Stockholm</COREF> has every incentive *PRO* to spin <COREF ID="2__36" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> in a good light ,
and all the reviews seem *PRO*-1 good .
<COREF ID="2__133" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ray_Hyde">I</COREF> 'm suspicious when no one seems *-1 to be able *PRO*-2 to find any shortcomings *T*-3 .
In <COREF ID="2__91" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> , it *EXP*-1 took quite some time for <COREF ID="2__94" TYPE="IDENT">the economic effects</COREF> to sort <COREF ID="2__94" TYPE="IDENT">themselves</COREF> out and be measured *-2 .
Although <COREF ID="2__96" TYPE="IDENT">the <COREF ID="2__91" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> experiment</COREF> also seems *-1 to be a success , there is considerable movement against <COREF ID="2__96" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> and the rapid rise in tolling charges that *T*-2 followed .
It *EXP*-1 does not seem *PRO*-3 likely that <COREF ID="2__96" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be repeated *-2 in other English cities .
For the record , <COREF ID="2__133" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ray_Hyde">I</COREF> 'm in favor of <COREF ID="2__110" TYPE="IDENT">congestion tolling</COREF> , but <COREF ID="2__133" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ray_Hyde">I</COREF> also think 0 <COREF ID="2__110" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will hasten the de-emphasis of central areas .
In <COREF ID="2__91" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> there seems *-1 to be a distinct decrease in business just inside the edge of the congestion zone and a distinct increase just outside .
It is too soon *PRO* to see what *T*-1 happens in <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">Stockholm</COREF> ,
but the situation in <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">stockholm</COREF> is a lot different from <COREF ID="2__91" TYPE="IDENT">London</COREF> .
Singapore is another example of effective use of congestion pricing .

<TEXT PARTNO="001">
<COREF ID="1__124" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="NoVA_Scout">I</COREF> 'm not usre that there 's much about <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Singapore 's</COREF> governmental philosophy *ICH*-2 that we should emulate *T*-1 -LRB- thinly disguised one - party rule -RRB- but , as someone who *T*-3 has spent a great deal of time there over the past 20 years , <COREF ID="1__124" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="NoVA_Scout">I</COREF> can testify that traffic in the center city is much improved without any indication that economic development has been curtailed *-4 .
In Southern California , there are at least two tollways with variable pricing that *T*-1 fluctuates with traffic density .
The highway design is configured *-1 *PRO* to give drivers options about whether *PRO* to pay the higher rates or get off the road .
*PRO* Seems *-1 to work .
re : congestion pricing and `` edge '' impacts .
simple - *PRO* move the boundaries ... :--RRB-
further , *PRO* let 's think outside the box here .
what *T*-1 makes `` congestion pricing '' - WORK ?
It 's electronic tolling .
`` congestion pricing '' is but one of dozens of possible outcomes based * on the underlying technology .
The privacy aspects are undeniable but the momentum towards electronic tolling is also *?* .
Right now .. they can `` track '' you with your cell phone and your credit card as well as red - light cameras and even security cameras in businesses .
Electronic Tolling will make possible other methods of *PRO* collecting revenue from vehicular travel besides congestion pricing .
Obviously new roads / expanded / improved roads *ICH*-1 will also be possible - roads that we currently have no money for *T*-2 and unlikely *PRO*-3 to have money for *T*-2 in the near future .
Electronic Tolls present an opportunity *PRO* to build new roads shortly after the study / decision is made *-1 - vice * waiting for years .. and in VDOT 's case decades .
The primary difference between this country and <COREF ID="1__82" TYPE="IDENT">other countries '</COREF> use of electronic tolling is that we 're still thinking of individual roads whereas <COREF ID="1__82" TYPE="IDENT">those other countries</COREF> are implementing electronic tolling for the REGION - as a way 0 *PRO* to SHAPE the entire network 's congestion *T*-1 .
So .. *PRO* think in terms of the entire <COREF ID="2__73" TYPE="IDENT">NoVa</COREF> area with a connecting network of electronically tolled roads being priced * by the hour ... and the place much like cell phone minutes .
You have *-1 to admit - the cell phone business model does two things very , very well .
First , you pay for when / where and do n't get a free ride
and second , the cell companies collect enough *ICH*-1 in revenues *PRO* to keep *-2 building more cell towers and expand coverage .
*PRO* think about the same model with roads and electronic tolling .
<COREF ID="1__121" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Larry_Gross">Larry</COREF> , the cell phone analogy is brilliant .
That is the logic of where the technology will take us *T*-1 -- if only politics do n't stand in the way .
Either <COREF ID="1__124" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="NoVA_Scout">Nova Scout</COREF> is right or <COREF ID="1__121" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Larry_Gross">Larry</COREF> is right .
Congestion pricing does n't seem *-1 to have limited <COREF ID="1__unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Singapore 's</COREF> economic activity , but how would you know *T*-2 ?
For one thing , it 's like traffic congestion :
<COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the demand</COREF> is so high that even if you build new roads or throttle <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">the demand</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is still high .
For another , If <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">Larry</COREF> is right and congestion pricing has shaped the region , then <COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">some of that economic activity</COREF> is not happening where <COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> might have *?* *T*-1 otherwise .
Transportation is very closey connected with economic activity .
So in that sense , what <COREF ID="2__19" TYPE="IDENT">tolling</COREF> does *T*-1 is *PRO* impose a tax on profits that *T*-2 have not yet been made *-3 .
<COREF ID="2__126" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ray_Hyde">I</COREF> think 0 you should tax only income and sales , but <COREF ID="2__126" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ray_Hyde">I</COREF> suppose 0 you could rationalize <COREF ID="2__19" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> as a sales tax on use of the roads .
<COREF ID="2__126" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Ray_Hyde">I</COREF> still think 0 there is no reason 0 *PRO* to institute tolling except in special circumstances : Expensive bridges , and highly congested zones , for example *T*-1 .
Otherwise <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="IDENT">a gas tax set * *PRO*-1 high enough *PRO* to do <COREF ID="2__41" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> job</COREF> is still a fairer and cheaper method , and more environmentally friendly :
<COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT">the infrastructure</COREF> is in place , and <COREF ID="2__45" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> automatically taxes by distance , weight , and horsepower .
The cell phone analogy is far from brilliant .
There are <COREF ID="2__52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">multiple cell phone companies</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="2__52" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Verizon Wireless , Cingular , Sprint , TMobile , etc.</COREF> -RRB- .
There is <COREF ID="2__60" TYPE="IDENT">only one medieval and corrupt General Assembly</COREF> .
And <COREF ID="2__60" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> goal was *RNR*-1 , is *RNR*-1 and will remain *RNR*-1 <COREF ID="2__62" TYPE="IDENT">the transfer of wealth from the economically successful -LRB- and congetsed -RRB- areas to those areas of <COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> locked * in the economic practices of the mid 1800s</COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__62" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> will not end until the Dillon Rule is discarded *-1 in <COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> or <COREF ID="2__73" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Virginia</COREF> forms a separate state .
Congestion `` pricing '' = congestion `` taxation '' .
If you want *PRO*-1 to continue the cell phone analogy then <COREF ID="2__79" TYPE="IDENT">Maryland</COREF> ought *-2 to have a chance *PRO* to propose <COREF ID="2__79" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> approach to traffic management using <COREF ID="2__73" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Virginia 's</COREF> taxes as a competitive alternative to <COREF ID="2__60" TYPE="IDENT">the General Assembly 's</COREF> proposal .
<COREF ID="2__87" TYPE="IDENT">The people of <COREF ID="2__73" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Virginia</COREF> -LRB- i.e. the buyers of the product offered * under congestion `` pricing '' -RRB-</COREF> would then have a choice - like <COREF ID="2__87" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> do today with cell phone service .
Until there is choice , this is just another method of *PRO* perpetuating the <COREF ID="2__73" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Virginia</COREF> subsidy of the southern Virginia welfare state .
No thanks .
<COREF ID="2__128" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Groveton">Groveton</COREF> , <COREF ID="2__128" TYPE="IDENT" SPEAKER="Groveton">You</COREF> 're missing the point of <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">Larry 's</COREF> post regarding the cell phone model :
`` First , you pay for when / where and do n't get a free ride
and second , the cell companies collect enough *ICH*-1 in revenues *PRO* to keep *-2 building more cell towers and expand coverage . ''
How does the presence of absence of competition affect either of those two attributes *T*-1 ?
As for <COREF ID="2__60" TYPE="IDENT">the `` Medieval corrupt '' General Assembly</COREF> , *PRO* do n't forget which region of <COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT">the state</COREF> *T*-1 sends more senators and delegates *ICH*-2 to <COREF ID="2__60" TYPE="IDENT">that body</COREF> than any other .

As we 've discussed *?* elsewhere on this blog , the transfer of wealth between regions is accounted for *-1 primarily by the `` Standards of Quality '' funding formula that *T*-2 redistributes resources from affluent school systems to poor school systems , and secondarily by road - funding formulas that *T*-3 favor rural areas .
Your criticisms should be directed *-1 to <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">those two particular funding formulas</COREF> , not to the `` General Assembly '' as a whole .
<COREF ID="unknown-E3" TYPE="IDENT">Northern Virginia 's</COREF> gripes over <COREF ID="14" TYPE="IDENT">these funding formulas</COREF> could be shared *-1 by the affluent suburbs of the <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Richmond</COREF> area --
but you do n't hear <COREF ID="unknown-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Richmond</COREF> suburbanites fantasizing about *PRO* seceding from the state .

<COREF ID="28" TYPE="IDENT">Some Northern Virginians</COREF> want it both ways .

A gated community on a regional scale !
