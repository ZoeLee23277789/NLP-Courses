    As we 've discussed elsewhere on this blog, the transfer of wealth between regions is accounted for primarily by the ``
    Standards of Quality '' funding formula that redistributes resources from affluent school systems to poor school
    systems, and secondarily by road-funding formulas that favor rural areas.
