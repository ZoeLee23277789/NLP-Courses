Well , gasoline in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Richmond</ENAMEX> has has hit <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3.00</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gallon</ENAMEX> , or just shy of it ,
and I spent <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 48</ENAMEX> filling up the gas tank of my <ENAMEX TYPE="PRODUCT">Jeep</ENAMEX> --
the most I 've ever paid for in my life .
I 'm not happy about it ,
but I do n't see high gas prices as a reason to start foaming at the mouth and chewing on the carpet .
Others feel less constrained .
The hysteria over rising gas prices has reached a fever pitch .
The economic ignorance of the sound bites and commentary I 've seen on national television knows no bounds .
Demagogues are calling for self - destructive taxes on oil company profits , oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profits are a critical signal that guide the flow of capital .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- If you confiscate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Exxon Mobil 's</ENAMEX> profits , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drilling , new oil wells , new pipelines , new refineries , etc.
-LRB- 2 -RRB- If you tax oil industry profits , you also reduce the incentive for owners of outside capital to invest in new capacity .
Why bother if the profits will be taxed away ?
Here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> , a semblance of sanity still reigns .
Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Timothy M. Kaine</ENAMEX> has not yet proposed anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposals emanating from <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Washington , D.C.</ENAMEX> .
The Governor has said he will investigate reports of `` price gouging , '' which , given the fact that the the concept of `` price gouging '' is meaningless and impossible to define , means he will , for all practical purposes , do nothing ....
Which is exactly what he should do .
Nothing .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Virginians</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Americans</ENAMEX> will adapt to higher gas prices if government does not interfere .
-LRB- The Governor also is considering applying for a waiver of federal regulations requiring cleaner gasoline be sold in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> 's major metro areas , but has not yet made a determination .
See the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Times - Dispatch</ENAMEX> report .
Unfortunately , he 's sticking to his guns on trying to raise <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 1 billion</ENAMEX> for transportation projects without raising gasoline taxes -- a topic for another post .
As I have been hammering away relentlessly on this blog -LRB- See `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">A World with One Billion Cars</ENAMEX> '' -RRB- , the world economy is moving from a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">20 - year</ENAMEX> era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
This shift is driven by the combination of -LRB- a -RRB- escalating world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly developing economies like <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">India</ENAMEX> , and -LRB- b -RRB- the peaking of global oil production capacity , the increasing expense of exploiting the remote and isolated oil reserves that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - producing countries .
This is not the oil companies ' fault .
This is not <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Cheney 's</ENAMEX> fault .
This is not the auto industries ' fault .
It is not the environmentalists ' fault .
It 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">American</ENAMEX> public can adapt to the new global realities by changing their energy - intensive lifestyles ,
and politicians can help them by speaking honestly and forthrightly about why the price of gasoline is increasing , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .
Here in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the General Assembly</ENAMEX> has been examining what <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> can do to increase energy production .
That is OK , as far as it goes .
But there is nothing that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refining capacity needed to convert oil to gasoline .
What the political and business leadership of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> has so far failed utterly to do is admit that <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> is acutely vulnerable to oil price shocks .
<ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Virginians</ENAMEX> consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy is geared toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulating travel demand .
But reality is a stubborn thing .
With each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order becomes increasingly evident .
Let us hope that Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kaine</ENAMEX> , who prides himself on straight talk , begins leveling with the people of <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> - You are right on the money about how capitalism works ,
so why not try to make capitalism really work for <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Virginia</ENAMEX> .
The future in transportation belongs to the nation , company or person who develops the alternative to gasoline powered automobiles .
Why not do everything we can to assure that future arises from Virginia ?
Rather than drilling for oil and gas off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Atlantic Coast</ENAMEX> , we should be offering enormous incentives for comapnies and individuals who want to work on alternative fuel solutions to locate their business here .
You can encourage R-AMP-D on alternative fuels with grants and tax breaks .
AND , you can work to increase supply .
The <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> and only oil refinery in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Commonwealth</ENAMEX> is nearby in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Yorktown</ENAMEX> .
They could double their capacity without leaving the premises .
Why has n't the company applied to do builf new facilities on site ?
By all means explore for oil and gas in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">Atlantic</ENAMEX> .
Jim : Speaking seriously here , many families -LRB- including my own -RRB- have already cut back in every way possible .
What then ?
My office , home and children 's schools are all within a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">6 mile</ENAMEX> radius .
Vacations are already a thing of the past .
We 've cut back on groceries .
I 'd trade the car on a hybrid ,
but it 's paid for
and who can afford a car payment what with mortgage rates being what they are and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> kids ...
So , I ask seriously , what are average hard - working families to do ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea</ENAMEX> : How about <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a couple of hundred dollars</ENAMEX> ?
If the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GA</ENAMEX> repealed the unnecessary sales tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .
Or , the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GA</ENAMEX> could actually cut the sales tax
and you would keep some more of your money .
Check out how much the <ENAMEX TYPE="NORP">Republican</ENAMEX> Senators want you to pay in other , new taxes too - to register your car , etc.
Jim : I like the graphic ,
it takes <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> arms and <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> legs to fill up our tank .
The only answer to cutting the cost of mobility and access is settlement patterns that require less vehicle travel and support more effecient shared - vehicles when one must resort to any vehicle .
That is what an understanding of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Jacobs</ENAMEX> suggested <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">40 years ago</ENAMEX> -LRB- not just in `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">Life and Death</ENAMEX> ... but also `` <ENAMEX TYPE="WORK_OF_ART">The Economy of ' Cities '</ENAMEX> . ''
Let us , honor Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacobs</ENAMEX> 's memory with an understanding of the need for Fundamental Change .
EMR
JAB - Got ta love it .
Yup , <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">a couple of hundred dollars</ENAMEX> is going to save the day !
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Jacobs</ENAMEX> knew the difference between a community and a construction plan .
Was n't <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> of her main arguments that you can not plan everything , and you should allow communities to be what they are and what they become ?
Did n't she fight <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Moses</ENAMEX> because he thought he had too much control over other peoples ' lives ?
Somehow I doubt she would have gotten on board with fundamental change if it involved massive central and regional planning .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrea</ENAMEX> , <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> option may be telecommuting <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">a couple of days</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">week</ENAMEX> .
Other than that , here 's the hard truth :
There 's not much that average , hard - working families can do in the short run to cope with higher gas prices except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation .
What you should NOT do is support demagogic political ploys that make problems worse , not better .
In the longer run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development patterns that give you and your family more transportation options .
You should support development patterns that allow compatible uses -LRB- houses , small office buildings , small retail shops -RRB- to be located close to each rather than scattered all over .
How much money could you save if you could get by with only <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">one</ENAMEX> car instead of <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> ?
What would it mean if you lived in a place where your children could walk to school ?
Think outside the box .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kingfish</ENAMEX> , I 'm all in favor of alternate fuels .
Converting biomass to ethanol seems to be one that is self - sustaining economically without massive incentives .
I 'd favor government - sponsored research to devise technologies that would make ethanol more competitive ,
but I do n't like the idea of subsidizing specific business enterprises .
Once you give them a subsidy , they never let go , no matter how much the world changes around them .
Witness the mohair subsidies put into place during <ENAMEX TYPE="EVENT">World War II</ENAMEX> .
I tend to agree with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> that markets function best , so long as no one has a finger on the scale .
Many believe that zone pricing , which is generally used by oil companies , is inconsistent with our antitrust laws -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="LAW">Section 13 of the Robinson - Patman Act</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
Others disagree .
Does zone pricing constitute a finger on the scale ?
If so , should the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">GA</ENAMEX> outlaw zone pricing ?
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toomanytaxes</ENAMEX> : Zone pricing is the mechanism the oil companies use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes .
Only , we pay <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">the extra few cents</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gallon</ENAMEX> to them rather than into our state transportation accounts .
Considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious .
I was recently on the webpage for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">the Energy Information Agency</ENAMEX>
and their cost of fuel adjusted for inflation chart demonstates that we have been at <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</ENAMEX> per <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gallon</ENAMEX> measured in <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">2005</ENAMEX> dollars before .
It is about the historic peak in real prices ,
but it is hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it is generating .
It is hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,
and that is not a bad outcome at all .
Like you , <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim</ENAMEX> , I see the bright silver lining .
I seem to be getting more questions whenever I pull up in my hybrid .
<ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">One</ENAMEX> data point .
2:53 Why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Prince William</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfax</ENAMEX> Counties and even at different locations within the same county ?
Zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates .
Take a look at the following link : http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx
Assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map ,
differences in do not explain zone pricing .
Look at <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Arizona</ENAMEX> , for example .
There are much higher transportation costs in and around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOC">the Grand Canyon</ENAMEX> and much more competition in the <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> market .
Yet , <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Phoenix</ENAMEX> prices tend to be signficantly higher .
Ditto for taxes .
From what I quickly found on the Internet , total fuel taxes for the following <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">four</ENAMEX> states are <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VA</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">37.7 cents</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">42.5 cents</ENAMEX> -RRB- ; <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NC</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">45.6 cents</ENAMEX> -RRB- and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> -LRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">46.2 cents</ENAMEX> -RRB- .
However , both <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Montana</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Utah</ENAMEX> have average prices that are significantly lower than either <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">VA</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">NC</ENAMEX> .
There 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe .
I had a conversation with a friend the other day who owns an SUV
and he is n't worried about the price of gas because he travels less than <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">10 miles</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="DATE">day</ENAMEX> ..
yes ..
it 'll cost more ...
so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">two</ENAMEX> cups rather than <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">three</ENAMEX> . :--RRB-
seriously - it 's about how far folks choose to drive and how folks define phrases like `` I must and have no choice '' .
It takes a hard knock for folks to take a hard look at things they always assumed could not change .
I predict ... lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice '' is truly no choice .
I know it happened during the gas crisis ...
and as bad as it is now - this is not as bad as then - though if <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 3</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gallon</ENAMEX> is in the rear view mirror and <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gallon</ENAMEX> on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ...
.. but I would bet that folks would choose -LRB- there 's that word again -RRB- <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">$ 4</ENAMEX> or even $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">5</ENAMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">gallon</ENAMEX> rather than waiting in line for <ENAMEX TYPE="TIME">3 hours</ENAMEX> only to find out the guy in front of you got the last tankful .
<ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">America</ENAMEX> 's love affair with the automobile is about to be revisted though I doubt seriously a divorce is anywhere near ... :--RRB-
sorry .. my attitude is grin and bear it ...
it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ...
my property accessment going up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">300 %</ENAMEX> -LRB- which it did -RRB- ...
... and today .. I paid $ <ENAMEX TYPE="MONEY">68</ENAMEX> bucks to fill up my 89 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORG">Ford</ENAMEX> Van .
I got ta talk to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Hyde</ENAMEX> about that Hybrid .... he 's got ..
he said if he had to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :--RRB-
Did I really say that ?
That would be a tough `` choice '' .
With the truck I 'd have some chance of making money ,
but I 'd hate to have to drive it if it was n't working .
If you have to drive , the hybrid is a joy .
Dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .
<ENAMEX TYPE="QUANTITY">48 mpg</ENAMEX> if you drive at <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">75+</ENAMEX> like a maniac .
I remember people sniffing at it , saying they would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there .
I drone on about costs and benefits , but a -RRB- that 's not everything , and b -RRB- sometimes circumstances change .
I 'm going to have to send a letter to the guv'nor .
I have a bunch of vehicles and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand .
I need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current `` tax '' plan is going to kill me .
I sure hope that those of you who think saving open space and farms will chip in and help out on this :
send a letter .
I do n't mind paying what it costs to drive or paying what I owe ,
but this is going to be whacked .
I suspect that overhead costs might have something to do with fuel prices .
That gas station in <ENAMEX TYPE="GPE">Fairfax</ENAMEX> is sitting on expensive land and paying high taxes .
Businesses are `` tax positive '' do n't cha know .
If people really do start making different choices , it 's going to be fun to watch real estate prices .
BTW <ENAMEX TYPE="PERCENT">13 %</ENAMEX> more new home sales last year , in spite of higher rates ,
but prices were down <ENAMEX TYPE="CARDINAL">5k</ENAMEX> .
Time to demand another reassessment .
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ray Hyde</ENAMEX> : Taxes are indeed business overhead that affect retail prices .
But I still suggest that zone pricing has more to do with computer software and data - mining than actual costs .
