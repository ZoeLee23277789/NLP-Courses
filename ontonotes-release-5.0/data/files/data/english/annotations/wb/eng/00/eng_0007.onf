    It would seem to be that if you took an office building in Crystal and converted it to apartments.. you 'd not have any
    more people-LRB-perhaps less-RRB-so you would n't need any more water/sewer capacity... and ditto for parking places...
    at least it would seem so-RRB-.

    If we choose to have a successful transportation plan then we should design the plan to meet the needs which will occur
    as a result of what is happening, rather than to meet the needs of what we wish would happen.

Treebanked sentence:
--------------------
    If we choose *PRO*-1 to have a successful transportation plan then we should design the plan *PRO* to meet the needs
    which *T*-2 will occur as a result of what *T*-3 is happening , rather than to meet the needs of what we wish 0 *T*-4
    would happen .
