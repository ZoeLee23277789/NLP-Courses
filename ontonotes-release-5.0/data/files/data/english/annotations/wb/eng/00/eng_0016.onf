Plain sentence:

    The CIA, DIA and State Department Bureaus of Near Eastern Affairs and Intelligence and Research--and certainly Rumsfeld
    as presidential envoy--also had reason to understand much about Saddam's grandiose ambition, in Iraq's old rivalry with
    Egypt, to lead a pan-Arab nationalist renaissance to some kind of future parity with Israel's nuclear-armed military
    might.

    own budgetary purposes, while ignoring the real import, and limits, of RMA--the Cold War ended in the equivocations and
    evasions of Bill Clinton's two terms in office and the low-rent, self-congratulatory installing of mafia regimes in
    Bosnia and Kosovo.

Plain sentence:

    In the exhilarating dash to Baghdad in 2003, none of the admiring gallery seemed to notice that Rumsfeld's `` new ''
    military was largely the old one, `` reformed '' in name only ; nor did many note that the vaunted lean, mean machine of
    RMA and the again-lionized Marshall had no grasp of how profoundly political was the act of overthrowing 40 years of Ba
    rule ; how deeply political was the campaign to which so many American lives, so much of the country's material and
    symbolic national treasures, would be committed.
