Even <COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> get tired of *PRO*-1 arguing about tax hikes .
For a change of pace , <COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> invite you *PRO*-1 to contemplate the hazard posed * by <COREF ID="1__91" TYPE="IDENT">that old computer monitor sitting in your basement or the pre-big screen TV collecting dust in your garage</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__91" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> contain toxic chemicals --
*PRO* do n't dump <COREF ID="1__91" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> in the trash !
*PRO* Be responsible and unload <COREF ID="1__91" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> at one of 18 electronics recycling events scheduled * in <COREF ID="1__106" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> this April .
If *PRO* landfilled or incinerated *-1 , hazardous materials in common electronic products may be released *-2 into the soil , air or water .
Televisions and computer monitors use <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0001.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">cathode ray tubes</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0001.part-000.aif-E3" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">CRTs</COREF> -RRB- , each of which *T*-1 contain as much as 8 pounds of lead .
Flat screen TVs and monitors contain mercury .
Printed circuit boards and switches in electronic devices contain small amounts of chromium , cadmium , mercury and lead .
'' Almost seventy - five percent of all obsolete electronics are still stored *-1 in offices and homes . This is a great opportunity *PRO* to get rid *-5 of <COREF ID="1__131" TYPE="IDENT">that old PC or VCR that *T*-2 has been collecting dust</COREF> and know 0 <COREF ID="1__131" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> will be responsibly reused or recycled *-3 , '' said *T*-4 <COREF ID="1__135" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Computer Recycling Initiative 's Director</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__135" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">Carrie Dorsey</COREF> .
*PRO* Click here *PRO*-1 to find a recycling event near you .
Good idea .
<COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd feel a lot better about it if the stuff did n't wind up *PRO*-1 going to <COREF ID="-E7" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> and being `` recycled *-2 '' in a manner that *T*-3 is environmentally unfriendly .
It 's kind of like <COREF ID="1__145" TYPE="IDENT">the Oregon soft drink cans</COREF> .
*PRO* Turns out 0 <COREF ID="1__145" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> were being ground *-1 up and turned *-1 into substrate for *PRO* leaching gold : a pretty nast process .
Darn , they are n't hitting Spotsy .
<COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've got two dead monitors taking up space in <COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> office .
Jim , on behalf of the Virginia Recycling Markets Development Council and <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0001.part-000.aif-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">the Mid-Atlantic Consortium of Recycling and Economic Development Officials</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0001.part-000.aif-E5" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">MACREDO</COREF> -RRB- , thanks for *PRO* plugging e-cycling .
Such events are becoming more frequent and more convenient to more <COREF ID="1__106" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> residents , although based on cod 's comment , we still have a ways 0 *PRO* to go *T*-1 .
A well - used economic development tool is the incubator , typically an office building that *T*-1 is subdivided *-2 and provides subsidized rent and admin services to <COREF ID="1__176" TYPE="IDENT">small business that *T*-3 have outgrown <COREF ID="1__176" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> garage or bedroom , but are too small for leased space</COREF> .
These incubators typically cater to high tech or `` clean '' service businesses .
<COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have always thought 0 we should consider *-1 setting up recycling `` incubators '' at landfills and transfer stations .
E-waste and construction waste are two potentially profitable steams
and *PRO* nurturing small recycling businesses might serve both an economic development good and a public good .
A person with a pick - up truck could start such a business pretty easily .
The cost of a trailer or two and a covered space would probably be much less than equivalent office space .
If we stimulated home - grown markets , we might not send so much to <COREF ID="-E7" TYPE="IDENT">China</COREF> , although <COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> suppose 0 anything 0 we can do *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to curb the trade deficit might be considered *-3 a good thing in some quarters .
That 's right .
<COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know <COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">a guy who *T*-1 gets <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0001.part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">surplus building materials</COREF> sorts and resells <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0001.part-001-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've bought quite a bit from <COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">him</COREF>
and <COREF ID="2__13" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> apparently does a good business .
<COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">The business <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">itself</COREF></COREF> is somewhat trashy looking .
It appears that <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is located *-1 on part of an old family farm ,
and the nearby houses are ones that *T*-1 have been spun *-2 off to family memebers .
But if anybody else tried *PRO*-1 to duplicate <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't think of anyplace in <COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> county where it would be allowed *-2 *T*-3 , or else the requirements would be so onerous 0 <COREF ID="2__22" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> could n't survive .
In <COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> home town , they once built an entire tanker truck for the fire department , out of stuff that *T*-1 came from <COREF ID="2__46" TYPE="IDENT">the dump</COREF> .
We had really low taxes .
<COREF ID="2__46" TYPE="IDENT">The dump</COREF> had well organized recycling areas located * around the central landfill pit ,
and people had a good eye for things that others might want *T*-1 .
<COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">Recycling</COREF> is a really good idea ,
but it *EXP*-1 is hard *PRO* to make <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> pay ,
and <COREF ID="2__56" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> has a waste stream of its own .
What we need *-1 to do *T*-2 is *PRO* to move the recycling process forward into the repair world .
<COREF ID="2__67" TYPE="IDENT">The Volkswagen Beetle</COREF> was a terrible car ,
but <COREF ID="2__67" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> was eminently recyclable .
<COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0001.part-001.aif-E5" TYPE="IDENT">one</COREF> for almost twenty years
and at the end there was n't a single part that *T*-1 was original .
The entire body had been swapped *-1 out , the machinery several times , and the running gear many times .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0001.part-001.aif-E5" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was still running when <COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> sold <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0001.part-001.aif-E5" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 ,
but if VDOT ever checked the serial numbers , <COREF ID="1__88" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't know what *T*-1 would happen .
The other thing 0 we need *-1 to do *T*-2 is *PRO* expand the deposit idea .
In addition to *PRO* having deposits on soft drink bottles , we should have them on appliances , autos and other big ticket items where they can do some good *T*-1 .
The deposit would <COREF ID="2__103" TYPE="IDENT">flow</COREF> to <COREF ID="2__101" TYPE="IDENT">the recycler who *T*-1 is the final user</COREF> :
<COREF ID="2__103" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> would make recycling profitable .
<COREF ID="2__101" TYPE="IDENT">He</COREF> would <COREF ID="2__108" TYPE="IDENT">claim</COREF> the refund from the manufacturer .
<COREF ID="2__108" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> would ensure that the user of <COREF ID="2__110" TYPE="IDENT">a product</COREF> pays for <COREF ID="2__110" TYPE="IDENT">its</COREF> disposal ,
and manufacturers would have an incentive *PRO* to keep the deposit money as long as possible by *PRO* building items that *T*-1 can be repaired *-2 rather than disposed of *-2 .
In the case of foreign manufacturers , the recycling fee would haqve a similar effect as an import duty and could be collected *-1 in the same way , but without *PRO* being called *-2 *PRO*-3 a tariff .
Why do some localities charge for <COREF ID="2__125" TYPE="IDENT">the service</COREF> while others do n't *T*-1 ?
Just curious .
Because , for the most part , <COREF ID="2__125" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is a money losing operation , or at most marginal .

<TEXT PARTNO="001">
*PRO* Recall the story of mandatory newspaper recycling in <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">the District</COREF> .
As a political city , <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> created so much waste product 0 <COREF ID="1__4" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> flooded the market .
If you want *PRO*-1 to look down the road , *PRO* think about what *T*-2 is going *-3 to happen after we spend a few billion *PRO*-4 to meet the <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">Chesapeake Bay</COREF> waste water restrictions .
Where are we going *-1 to put <COREF ID="1__14" TYPE="IDENT">all the sludge that *T*-2 results</COREF> *T*-3 ?
Once we stop *-1 putting <COREF ID="1__14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> in <COREF ID="1__17" TYPE="IDENT">the Bay</COREF> , we are going *-2 to have *-3 to put <COREF ID="1__14" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> on the land .
Then we will have regulations 0 *T*-1 to prevent sludge runoff in order that we do n't pay for the same sludge creation multiple times .
Eventually we will outlaw gravity so that sludge is prohibited *-1 from *PRO*-2 running downhill .
Coming soon to a farm near you : two month 's worth of stench .
As an engineer and a flinty New Englander , and a farmer , <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> spend a lot of time *PRO*-1 fixing <COREF ID="1__42" TYPE="IDENT">old junk</COREF> .
<COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ca n't stand *PRO*-1 throwing something away .
Maybe some of it comes from *PRO* growing up on an island where there was no place 0 *PRO* to throw <COREF ID="1__42" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> *T*-1 *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="1__51" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> father</COREF> used *-1 to say that <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">garbage</COREF> was like scotch tape .
-LRB- *PRO* Shaking <COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__51" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> thumb with an imaginary loop of tape on <COREF ID="1__55" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF></COREF> . -RRB-
`` You ca n't throw <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> away ,
you can only stick <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> someplace else . ''
When <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0001.part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">repairing</COREF> <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">something that *T*-1 was designed *-2 so <COREF ID="1__65" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ca n't be fixed *-3</COREF> *T*-4 , it makes <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> crazy .
<COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> want *PRO*-1 to go *PRO*-2 find some enginner and marketing guy an knock heads together .
Here are a few examples .
A rototiller with gears made * out of free machining brass .
*PRO* Guaranteed *-1 to fail .
<COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">A windshiel wiper motor installed * in a totally inaccessible place under <COREF ID="1__81" TYPE="IDENT">the dash</COREF> .</COREF>
<COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> was installed *-1 by *PRO* compressing <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">four little rubber studs</COREF> into holes in the sheet metal , and sealed *-1 with a ten inch oblong flat gasket .
When <COREF ID="1__83" TYPE="IDENT">the rubber studs</COREF> rotted away *T*-1 , <COREF ID="1__78" TYPE="IDENT">the motor</COREF> fell on the floor , *PRO*-2 followed *-3 by a torrent of rain that *T*-4 shorted out everything under <COREF ID="1__81" TYPE="IDENT">the dash</COREF> .
A 1/4 inch diameter spring loaded shift lever detent that you had *-1 to break the tractor in half *PRO* to replace *T*-2 .
Every piece of household plumbing and wiring 0 <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ever had *-1 to fish *T*-2 through a hollow wall .
Anything that *T*-1 can only be repaired *-2 upside down .
<COREF ID="1__106" TYPE="IDENT">A twelve bolt circle on a transmission housing with six hex head bolts and six star pattern bolts .</COREF>
*PRO* Try and figure <COREF ID="1__106" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> out in the dark under the car .
The ignitor for <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">the gas range</COREF> that *T*-1 costs 25 % of what <COREF ID="1__117" TYPE="IDENT">the range</COREF> cost *T*-2 .
What *T*-1 's worse is , that because <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm good at <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0001.part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">this</COREF> , people think 0 <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> like <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0001.part-002-E2" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> .
Wrong .
<COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> hate things
and <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> love flesh .
<COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm convinced that things are inhabited *-1 with Gremlins .
It 's a vicious circle .
The more stuff you have *?* the more stuff you need *?* *PRO*-1 to maintain it , like the <COREF ID="2__75" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> Highways .
It starts with a screwdriver ,
and next thing 0 you know *T*-1 it 's a shopfull of air compressors , saws , welders , a forklift , an earthmover , a dump truck 0 *T*-2 to haul the earthmover .....
<COREF ID="2__17" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> wife</COREF> takes great glee in *PRO*-1 making fun of all of this .
Then <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> pointed out <COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">all he special purpose tools in <COREF ID="2__17" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> kithchen</COREF> ,
and <COREF ID="2__24" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is just for one job .
<COREF ID="2__17" TYPE="IDENT">She</COREF> carefuly forgets all that when <COREF ID="2__17" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> needs something and it turns out that <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> have just the right framitz *PRO*-1 to manufacture a repair piece for <COREF ID="2__17" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> thing - a - bob *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm convinced that we could solve our balance of payments deficits if we just passed *PRO* must be repairable laws .
Every engineer should be required *-1 *PRO*-2 to be a mechanic for ten years .
For <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">many of us</COREF> <COREF ID="2__49" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> life has come down to *PRO* buy it at Wal - mart and take it to the dump .
Even if you buy it at the BMW or John Deere dealer it is no different .
So , if PEC wants *PRO*-1 to make a supporter out of <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">me</COREF> , the way 0 *PRO* to do it *T*-2 is *PRO* to start a campaign that *T*-3 ensures 0 things do n't have *-4 to be thrown *-5 away , not one 0 *T*-6 to recycle them at a loss .
<COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> work for <COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT">E-Tech Recycling Inc -LRB- http://www.etechrecycling.com -RRB- , an electronics recycling company located * in <COREF ID="2__75" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__72" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> recycle all types of electronics items such as computers , monitors , TVs etc.
When <COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> speak with <COREF ID="2__81" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> about the importance of *PRO* recycling electronic items *T*-1 , <COREF ID="2__81" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are very ignorant .
<COREF ID="1__39" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> think 0 more than anything , we need *-1 to educate people about the importance of recycling .
