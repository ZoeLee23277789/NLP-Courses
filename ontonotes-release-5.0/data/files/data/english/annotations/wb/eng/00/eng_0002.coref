Well , gasoline in Richmond has has hit <COREF ID="1__50" TYPE="IDENT">$ 3.00 *U*</COREF> a gallon , or just shy of <COREF ID="1__50" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ,
and <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">spent</COREF> $ 48 *U* *PRO*-1 filling up the gas tank of <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> Jeep --
the most 0 <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've ever paid *T*-1 for *?* in <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> life .
<COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm not happy about <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-000.aif-E1" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> ,
but <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't see high gas prices as a reason 0 *PRO* to start *-1 foaming at the mouth and chewing on the carpet *T*-2 .
Others feel less constrained .
The hysteria over rising gas prices has reached a fever pitch .
The economic ignorance of the sound bites and commentary 0 <COREF ID="1__53" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 've seen *T*-1 on national television knows no bounds .
Demagogues are calling for self - destructive taxes on oil company profits , *PRO*-1 oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profits are a critical signal that *T*-2 guide the flow of capital .
-LRB- 1 -RRB- If you confiscate <COREF ID="1__92" TYPE="IDENT">Exxon Mobil 's</COREF> profits , you reduce the capital available to <COREF ID="1__92" TYPE="IDENT">the world 's largest oil company</COREF> 0 *PRO* to invest *T*-1 in more exploratory drilling , new oil wells , new pipelines , new refineries , etc.
-LRB- 2 -RRB- If you tax oil industry profits , you also reduce the incentive for owners of outside capital to invest in new capacity .
Why *PRO* bother if the profits will be taxed *-2 away *T*-1 ?
Here in <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> , a semblance of sanity still reigns .
<COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">Gov. Timothy M. Kaine</COREF> has not yet proposed anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposals emanating from Washington , D.C. .
<COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">The Governor</COREF> has said 0 <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will investigate reports of `` price gouging , '' which , *T*-1 given the fact that the the concept of `` price gouging '' is meaningless and impossible 0 *PRO* to define *T*-2 , means 0 <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> will , for all practical purposes , do nothing ....
Which *T*-1 is exactly what <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> should do *T*-2 .
Nothing .
Virginians and Americans will adapt to higher gas prices if government does not interfere .
-LRB- <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">The Governor</COREF> also is considering *PRO*-1 applying for a waiver of federal regulations requiring 0 cleaner gasoline be sold *-2 in <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> 's major metro areas , but has not yet made a determination .
*PRO* See the Times - Dispatch report .
Unfortunately , <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's sticking to <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> guns on *PRO*-1 trying *PRO*-2 to raise $ 1 billion *U* for transportation projects without *PRO*-3 raising gasoline taxes -- a topic for another post .
As I have been hammering away relentlessly on this blog -LRB- *PRO* See `` A World with One Billion Cars '' -RRB- , the world economy is <COREF ID="2__9" TYPE="IDENT">moving</COREF> from a 20 - year era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
<COREF ID="2__9" TYPE="IDENT">This shift</COREF> is driven *-1 by the combination of -LRB- a -RRB- escalating world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly developing economies like China and India , and -LRB- b -RRB- the peaking of global oil production capacity , the increasing expense of *PRO* exploiting the remote and isolated oil reserves that *T*-2 remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - producing countries .
<COREF ID="2__9" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not the oil companies ' fault .
<COREF ID="2__9" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not Dick Cheney 's fault .
<COREF ID="2__9" TYPE="IDENT">This</COREF> is not the auto industries ' fault .
<COREF ID="2__9" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> is not the environmentalists ' fault .
<COREF ID="2__9" TYPE="IDENT">It</COREF> 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
<COREF ID="2__34" TYPE="IDENT">The American public</COREF> can adapt to the new global realities by *PRO*-1 changing <COREF ID="2__34" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> energy - intensive lifestyles ,
and politicians can help <COREF ID="2__34" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> by *PRO*-1 speaking honestly and forthrightly about why <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">the price of gasoline</COREF> is increasing *T*-2 , instead of demagoguing <COREF ID="2__40" TYPE="IDENT">the issue</COREF> for short - term political gain .
Here in <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> , the General Assembly has been <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0002.part-001.aif-E5" TYPE="IDENT">examining</COREF> what <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> can do *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to increase energy production .
<COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0002.part-001.aif-E5" TYPE="IDENT">That</COREF> is OK , as far as it goes .
But there is nothing that <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> can do *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little 0 <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> can do *T*-3 *PRO*-4 to increase the petroleum refining capacity needed * *PRO* to convert oil to gasoline .
What the political and business leadership of <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> has so far failed utterly *-1 to do *T*-2 is *PRO* admit that <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> is acutely vulnerable to oil price shocks .
<COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">Virginians</COREF> consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because <COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> transportation policy is geared *-1 toward *PRO* matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of *PRO* modulating travel demand .
But reality is a stubborn thing .
With each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order becomes increasingly evident .
*PRO* Let <COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">us</COREF> hope that <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">Gov. Kaine</COREF> , who *T*-1 prides <COREF ID="1__109" TYPE="IDENT">himself</COREF> on straight talk , begins *-2 leveling with <COREF ID="2__64" TYPE="IDENT">the people of <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF></COREF> .
<COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="IDENT">Jim</COREF> - <COREF ID="2__90" TYPE="IDENT">You</COREF> are right on the money about how capitalism works *T*-1 ,
so why not *PRO* try *PRO*-1 to make capitalism really work for <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> *T*-2 .
<COREF ID="2__96" TYPE="IDENT">The future in transportation</COREF> belongs to the nation , company or person who *T*-1 develops the alternative to gasoline powered automobiles .
Why not *PRO* do everything 0 we can *?* *T*-1 *PRO* to assure 0 <COREF ID="2__96" TYPE="IDENT">that future</COREF> arises from <COREF ID="2__44" TYPE="IDENT">Virginia</COREF> *T*-2 ?
Rather than *PRO* drilling for oil and gas off the Atlantic Coast , we should be offering enormous incentives for comapnies and individuals who *T*-1 want *PRO*-2 to work on alternative fuel solutions to locate their business here .
You can encourage R-AMP-D on alternative fuels with grants and tax breaks .
AND , you can work *PRO* to increase supply .

<COREF ID="1__0" TYPE="IDENT">The one and only oil refinery in the Commonwealth</COREF> is nearby in Yorktown .
<COREF ID="1__0" TYPE="IDENT">They</COREF> could double <COREF ID="1__0" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> capacity without *PRO*-1 leaving the premises .
Why has n't the company applied *PRO*-1 to do builf new facilities on site *T*-2 ?
By all means *PRO* explore for oil and gas in the Atlantic .
<COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">Jim</COREF> : *PRO* Speaking seriously here , many families -LRB- including <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> own</COREF> -RRB- have already cut back in every way possible .
What then ?
<COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">My</COREF> office , home and children 's schools are all within a 6 mile radius .
Vacations are already a thing of the past .
<COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">We</COREF> 've cut back on groceries .
<COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd trade <COREF ID="1__28" TYPE="IDENT">the car</COREF> on a hybrid ,
but <COREF ID="1__28" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 's paid for *-1
and who can *T*-1 afford a car payment what with <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">mortgage rates</COREF> being what <COREF ID="1__33" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *T*-2 and three kids ...
So , <COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> ask seriously , what are average hard - working families *-1 to do *T*-2 ?
<COREF ID="-E5" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea</COREF> : How about a couple of hundred dollars ?
If <COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">the GA</COREF> repealed the unnecessary sales tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .
Or , <COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">the GA</COREF> could actually cut the sales tax
and you would keep some more of your money .
*PRO* Check out how much *ICH*-2 the Republican Senators want you to pay *T*-1 in other , new taxes too - *PRO* to register your car , etc.
<COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">Jim</COREF> : <COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> like the graphic ,
it *EXP*-1 takes two arms and two legs *PRO* to fill up <COREF ID="1__15" TYPE="IDENT">our</COREF> tank .
The only answer to *PRO* cutting the cost of mobility and access is settlement patterns that *T*-1 require less vehicle travel and support more effecient shared - vehicles when one must resort to any vehicle *T*-2 .
That is what an understanding of <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">Jane Jacobs</COREF> suggested *T*-1 40 years ago -LRB- not just in `` Life and Death ... but also `` The Economy of ' Cities ' . ''
*PRO* Let us , honor <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">Ms. Jacobs 's</COREF> memory with an understanding of the need for Fundamental Change .
EMR
JAB - *PRO* Got *-1 ta love it .
Yup , a couple of hundred dollars is going *-1 to save the day !
<COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">Jane Jacobs</COREF> knew the difference between a community and a construction plan .
Was n't one of <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">her</COREF> main arguments that you can not plan everything , and you should allow <COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">communities</COREF> to be what <COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> are *T*-1 and what <COREF ID="1__102" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> become *T*-2 ?
Did n't <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> fight <COREF ID="1__106" TYPE="IDENT">Robert Moses</COREF> because <COREF ID="1__106" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> thought 0 <COREF ID="1__106" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had too much control over other peoples ' lives ?
Somehow <COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> doubt 0 <COREF ID="1__76" TYPE="IDENT">she</COREF> would have gotten on board with <COREF ID="1__114" TYPE="IDENT">fundamental change</COREF> if <COREF ID="1__114" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> involved massive central and regional planning .
<COREF ID="-E5" TYPE="IDENT">Andrea</COREF> , One option may be <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0002.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">telecommuting</COREF> a couple of days a week .
Other than <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0002.part-003-E1" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> , here 's *T*-1 the hard truth :
There 's not much that <COREF ID="2__11" TYPE="IDENT">average , hard - working families</COREF> can do *T*-1 in the short run *PRO*-2 to cope with higher gas prices except *PRO* hope that <COREF ID="2__11" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> paychecks keep pace with inflation .
What you should NOT do *T*-1 is *PRO* support demagogic political ploys that *T*-2 make problems worse , not better .
In the longer run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development patterns that *T*-1 give you and your family more transportation options .
You should support development patterns that *T*-1 allow compatible uses -LRB- houses , small office buildings , small retail shops -RRB- to be located *-2 close to each rather than scattered *-2 all over .
How much money could you save *T*-1 if you could get by with only one car instead of two ?
What would it mean *T*-1 if you lived in a place where your children could walk to school *T*-2 ?
*PRO* Think outside the box .
Kingfish , <COREF ID="2__48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'm all in favor of alternate fuels .
*PRO* Converting biomass to <COREF ID="2__52" TYPE="IDENT">ethanol</COREF> seems *-1 to be one that *T*-2 is self - sustaining economically without massive incentives .
<COREF ID="2__48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> 'd favor government - sponsored research 0 *T*-2 to devise technologies that *T*-1 would make <COREF ID="2__52" TYPE="IDENT">ethanol</COREF> more competitive ,
but <COREF ID="2__48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> do n't like the idea of *PRO* subsidizing specific business enterprises .
Once you give <COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> a subsidy , <COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> never let go , no matter how much the world changes *T*-1 around <COREF ID="2__61" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> .
*PRO* Witness the mohair subsidies put * into place during World War II .
<COREF ID="2__48" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> tend *-1 to agree with <COREF ID="1__13" TYPE="IDENT">Jim</COREF> that markets function best , so long as no one has a finger on the scale .
Many believe that zone pricing , which *T*-1 is generally used *-2 by oil companies , is inconsistent with <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="HEAD">our antitrust laws</COREF> -LRB- <COREF ID="2__80" TYPE="APPOS" SUBTYPE="ATTRIB">Section 13 of the Robinson - Patman Act</COREF> -RRB- .
Others disagree .
Does zone pricing constitute a finger on the scale ?
If so , should <COREF ID="1__40" TYPE="IDENT">the GA</COREF> outlaw zone pricing ?
<COREF ID="-E6" TYPE="IDENT">Toomanytaxes</COREF> : Zone pricing is the mechanism 0 <COREF ID="2__93" TYPE="IDENT">the oil companies</COREF> use *T*-1 *PRO*-2 to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes .
Only , we pay the extra few cents per gallon to <COREF ID="2__93" TYPE="IDENT">them</COREF> rather than into our state transportation accounts .
*PRO* Considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious .
<COREF ID="-E6" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> was recently on the webpage for <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">the Energy Information Agency</COREF>
and <COREF ID="2__112" TYPE="IDENT">their</COREF> cost of fuel adjusted * for inflation chart demonstates that we have been at $ 3 *U* per gallon measured * in 2005 dollars before .
It is about <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0002.part-003.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">the historic peak in real prices</COREF> ,
but <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0002.part-003.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria 0 <COREF ID="2__wl_eng_0002.part-003.aif-E4" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> is generating *T*-1 .
It *EXP*-1 is hard *PRO* to imagine a company or a family that *T*-2 can not improve its efficiency and <COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT">reduce</COREF> consumption ,
and <COREF ID="2__134" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> is not a bad outcome at all .

Like <COREF ID="1__0" TYPE="IDENT">you</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__0" TYPE="IDENT">Jim</COREF> , <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> see the bright silver lining .
<COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> seem *-1 to be getting more questions whenever <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> pull up in <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> hybrid *T*-2 .
One data point .
2:53 Why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between Prince William and Fairfax Counties and even at different locations within the same county *T*-1 ?
Zone pricing is trying *PRO*-1 to do much more than *PRO* reflect different tax rates .
*PRO* Take a look at the following link : http://www.gasbuddy.com/gb_gastemperaturemap.aspx
*PRO* Assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map ,
differences in do not explain zone pricing .
*PRO* Look at Arizona , for example .
There are much higher transportation costs in and around the Grand Canyon and much more competition in the <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Phoenix</COREF> market .
Yet , <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E1" TYPE="IDENT">Phoenix</COREF> prices tend *-1 to be signficantly higher .
Ditto for taxes .
From what <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> quickly found *T*-1 on the Internet , total fuel taxes for the following four states are <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E6" TYPE="IDENT">VA</COREF> -LRB- 37.7 cents -RRB- ; <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E4" TYPE="IDENT">Utah</COREF> -LRB- 42.5 cents -RRB- ; <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E7" TYPE="IDENT">NC</COREF> -LRB- 45.6 cents -RRB- and <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E5" TYPE="IDENT">Montana</COREF> -LRB- 46.2 cents -RRB- .
However , both <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E5" TYPE="IDENT">Montana</COREF> and <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E4" TYPE="IDENT">Utah</COREF> have average prices that *T*-1 are significantly lower than either <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E6" TYPE="IDENT">VA</COREF> or <COREF ID="1__wl_eng_0002.part-004-E7" TYPE="IDENT">NC</COREF> .
There 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe .
<COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> had a conversation with <COREF ID="1__61" TYPE="IDENT">a friend *ICH*-1</COREF> the other day who *T*-2 owns an SUV
and <COREF ID="1__61" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> is n't worried about the price of <COREF ID="1__66" TYPE="IDENT">gas</COREF> because <COREF ID="1__61" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> travels less than 10 miles a day ..
yes ..
<COREF ID="1__66" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> 'll cost more ...
so <COREF ID="1__61" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'll have *-1 to cut back on <COREF ID="1__61" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> gourmet coffee ... two cups rather than three . :--RRB-
seriously - it 's about how far folks choose *PRO*-1 to drive *T*-2 and how folks define phrases like `` I must and have no choice '' *T*-3 .
It *EXP*-1 takes a hard knock for <COREF ID="1__86" TYPE="IDENT">folks</COREF> to take a hard look at things 0 <COREF ID="1__86" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> always assumed 0 *T*-2 could not change .
<COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> predict ... 0 lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice '' is truly no choice .
<COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> know 0 it happened during the gas crisis ...
and *PRO* as bad as it is *?* now - this is not as bad as then - though if $ 3 *U* a gallon is in the rear view mirror and $ 4 *U* a gallon on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ...
.. but <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> would bet that folks would choose -LRB- there 's that word again -RRB- $ 4 *U* or even $ 5 *U* a gallon rather than *PRO* waiting in line for 3 hours only *PRO* to find out 0 the guy in front of you got the last tankful .
America 's love affair with the automobile is about *PRO*-1 to be revisted *-2 though <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> doubt seriously 0 a divorce is anywhere near ... :--RRB-
sorry .. <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> attitude is *PRO* grin and bear it ...
it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ...
<COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">my</COREF> property accessment</COREF> going up 300 % -LRB- which <COREF ID="2__10" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> did *T*-1 -RRB- ...
... and today .. <COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> paid $ 68 bucks *PRO*-1 to fill up my 89 Ford Van .
<COREF ID="1__2" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> got *-1 ta talk to <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">Ray Hyde</COREF> about <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">that Hybrid .... 0 <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 's got *T*-2</COREF> ..
<COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> said 0 if <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> had *-1 to choose .. <COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">he</COREF> 'd keep <COREF ID="2__26" TYPE="IDENT"><COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">his</COREF> truck</COREF> ... :--RRB-

If you have *-1 to drive , <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">the hybrid</COREF> is a joy .
Dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .

<COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> remember <COREF ID="2__50" TYPE="IDENT">people</COREF> sniffing at <COREF ID="2__21" TYPE="IDENT">it</COREF> , *PRO*-1 saying 0 <COREF ID="2__50" TYPE="IDENT">they</COREF> would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there .
<COREF ID="2__20" TYPE="IDENT">I</COREF> drone on about <COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">costs and benefits</COREF> , but a -RRB- <COREF ID="2__57" TYPE="IDENT">that</COREF> 's not everything , and b -RRB- sometimes circumstances change .
